Laura Chinchilla shares her hopes for Latin America’s future
NORA MATTSON
Assistant News Editor
Though Laura Chinchilla, 
former president of Costa 
Rica, has spent fourteen 
years in public of?ce and 
only one year as a fellow 
at Georgetown University, 
the tone struck in her talk 
on Wednesday, Nov. 1, was 
decidedly more professorial 
than political. This event, 
sponsored by the Center 
for International Relations 
and Politics, the Of?ce of 
Government Relations, and 
the Department of Modern 
Languages, explored Chin-
chilla’s hopes for the fu-
ture of Latin America in 
the face of what she sees as 
the encroaching threat of 
populism.
The Rashid Auditorium 
was packed to the brim 
with faculty, students, trust-
ees, and visiting business, 
foundation, and nonpro?t 
leaders by the time Kiron 
Skinner, Director of the 
Center for International 
Relations and Politics, the 
Institute for Politics and 
Strategy, and the Institute 
for Strategic Analysis gave 
her introduction to Inter-
im President Farnam Ja-
hanian, interim president of 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
who kicked off the event by 
explaining the place of the 
policy forum on campus, 
?nding that “the Center 
for International Relations 
and Politics integrates in-
ternational relations and 
politics into intellectual 
conversations at Carnegie 
Mellon.”
He continued by 
highlighting the focus on 
analytical social science that 
Carnegie Mellon brings to 
policy discussions, joking 
that since this was Carnegie 
Mellon that, of course, the 
social science in question 
was analytical before also 
touching on how “analytical 
social science and interdis-
ciplinary scholarship work 
together to broaden our per-
spective on major issues not 
just facing the United States 
but the world.”
For this purpose, Dr. 
Jahanian introduced former 
President Laura Chinchilla, 
reminding audiences that 
she was the ?rst female pres-
ident of Costa Rica and the 
?fth woman to be elected 
to lead Latin America in the 
past forty years before quip-
ping that impressed audi-
ences “can clap, if you want, 
by the way.”
Chinchilla started by 
bringing up that, though 
Latin America is often on 
the backburner of American 
Foreign policy, its social and 
political situation affects the 
U.S. in a way that few other 
regions do. “Trade, immi-
gration, and drug traf?cking 
are three of the more impor-
tant domestic policy chal-
lenges that the United States 
faces today. And to succeed 
in all of them, it will require 
the action and cooperation 
of all of Latin America,” 
emphasized Chinchilla.
She ?nds that this 
inattention to Latin America 
is where “precisely, lies the 
importance of academia 
in organizing events like 
this one to highlight pri-
orities and redress long due 
policies within the public 
administration.” She echoed 
Dr. Jahanian’s point that 
events like these are neces-
sary to reevaluate priorities 
in stating that “if academia 
continues to care about 
the relationship with Latin 
America, the government 
will not be able to ignore 
that call.”
In her analysis of the 
current political and eco-
nomic situation of Latin 
America, she diagnosed 
the frequent ?uctuations 
of Latin American econo-
mies as the reason for the 
lack of sustainable growth, 
stating that “the variation in 
the economic cycle that has 
characterized our nations 
has also affected our social 
indicators.” She speci?cally 
brought up  the example of 
Venezuela, noting that it 
had moved from being one 
of the largest economies 
in the world to a country 
in economic collapse, ex-
periencing a humanitarian 
crisis. “Instead of devising 
new ways to expand democ-
racies, some governments 
have come up with new 
ways to undermine it. Cor-
ruption, for example.” This 
is an issue that hits close to 
home for Chinchilla, as the 
New York Times cited an-
ger about “unemployment, 
crime, and corruption scan-
dals” as part of the reason 
she left of?ce with one of the 
lowest approval ratings of 
any Latin American leader.
Her talk was titled “Hope 
in Times of Populism,” so 
the bleak opening that cited 
the “strong sense of wasted 
opportunity” which she felt 
was unique to the region 
was surprising for many in 
the audience. After outlin-
ing the problem, she quickly 
assured that she “would 
like to take a kind of differ-
ent approach today. I am a 
very strong critic of my own 
region because also I under-
stand that criticism is very 
important to try to move 
everybody ahead.”
The “hope in times of 
populism” which the title of 
her talk referenced was that 
Latin America was poised to

EVANGELINE LIU

In the twentieth century — and 
even in the late nineteenth cen-
tury — evidence was discovered 
and eventually confirmed that 
the mass data analyzed from the 
visible mass of stars in galaxies 
did not match up with the masses 
that would be implied by the ro-
tation rates of the galaxies. In 
particular, the observed rotation 
rates of galaxies were faster than 
would be possible if the only mass 
in the galaxies came from visible 
matter from stars; if that were 
the case, the galaxies would fly 
apart. Additionally, gravitational 
lensing of galaxy clusters could 
determine their masses and it was 
found that there was a significant 
mass that was unaccounted for by 
the visible matter we can detect. 
Thus, researchers hypothesized 
the existence of “dark matter” — 
a form of unseen, hard-to-detect 
matter that provides the neces-
sary gravity to hold these fast-
rotating galaxies together.
Dan Akerib, a professor of 
particle physics and astrophys-
ics at Stanford University and 
researcher at the SLAC Na-
tional Accelerator Laboratory 
(originally named the Stanford 
Linear Accelerator Center), was 
at Carnegie Mellon on Oct. 26 to 
give a lecture on his years of re-
searching the nature of dark mat-
ter, which is still one of astrophys-
ics’ greatest unsolved mysteries.
In an interview with The 
Tartan, Akerib explained how 
dark matter came to captivate 
him. “I think that the idea that 
most of the matter in the uni-
verse is something that is differ-
ent from us [is very fascinating]... 
someone described it as the ulti-
mate Copernican revolution,” he 
reflected. He added, “not only 
are we not at the center of the 
universe, we’re not even made of 
the same stuff.”
Akerib started the lecture with 
a brief historical summary of the 
reasoning behind the dark matter 
hypothesis and noted the work of 
Vera Rubin, who pioneered the 
idea of graphing rotation rates 
versus distance from the center of 
the galaxy, which at outer distance 
ranges deviated significantly from 
the theoretical curve. Her work 
formed the foundation of the dark 
matter hypothesis and the basis of 
today’s research on the subject.
Akerib then summarized cos-
mological methods used by as-
tronomers and astrophysicists to 
weigh the universe — in particu-
lar, to find the percentage compo-
sition of visible mass, dark mat-
ter, and energy in the universe. 
He explained that this ratio is 
significant as matter tends to at-
tract while energy tends to repel. 
In particular, the three main 
methods that cosmologists use 
to find the ratios are supernovae 
standard candles, the 3K cosmic 
microwave background, and the 
matter distributions in the early 
and current universe. The re-
sults yield an energy density of 
approximately 70 percent.
Currently, one of the leading 
theories on the nature of dark 
matter is the WIMP theory, short 
for “weakly interacting massive 
particles.” They are called 
“weakly interacting” because they 
do not form stars or interact much 
with normal matter and have 
very small cross sections, and 
“massive” because of the gravi-
tational pull they exert. WIMPs 
are hypothesized to form in the 
Big Bang, and because they are 
hypothesized to have small cross 
sections when the universe was 
expanding, it would have been 
probabilistically difficult for 
WIMPs and anti-WIMPs in the 
early universe to find each other 
and annihilate. Akerib described 
WIMPs as “similar to very heavy 
neutrinos”.
The next step of the theory 
is always to find evidence for it, 
but so far detection of WIMPs has 
proved elusive. He explained that 
WIMPs are most likely not peri-
odic table elements and electri-
cally neutral; “ordinary matter is 
virtually invisible to this stuff” — 
as an example of just how little in-
teraction they have with ordinary 
matter, he stated that WIMPs on 
average scatter once in a light-
year of lead. WIMPs are, by defi-
nition, elusive to our eyes and 
instruments.
Luckily for WIMP researchers 
like Akerib, WIMP events occur 
on the order of 10 to the power 
of 16 times annually, so Akerib 
and his team have developed a 
detector to try and detect some 
of these events. The detector-
building process faced a slew of 
technical challenges — electron-
ic noise, the inability to detect 
signals below a certain range, 
and the natural radioactivity 
scattered throughout the Earth’s 
crust that could interfere with the 
detector. Eventually, the detec-
tor was designed to be a chamber 
that held liquid xenon (to keep 
the radioactivity as low as possi-
ble in the center of the chamber), 
which would be ionized by the 
kinetic energy of the WIMP par-
ticles, creating an ionization that 
can be detected. The detector was 
housed in a large water pool a few 
meters underground to minimize 
interference from cosmic rays and 
other extraneous signals.
While the initial runs have not 
caught any events, Akerib and 
his team plan to continue their 
research by building a detector 
fifty times larger than the origi-
nal one. Much of their everyday 
work consists of making and test-
ing the wire meshes that go in the 
detector — which is very sensitive 
to the smallest imperfections — 
and purifying xenon gas samples 
using gas charcoal chromatogra-
phy.
He detailed an anecdote from 
the building process: locals near 
the site of the upcoming detec-
tor were worried about radiation 
levels from the xenon, which 
turned out to be roughly equal to 
20 bananas’ worth of radiation. 
As a reference, people get about 
100 bananas’ dosage of radia-
tion daily. “You can no longer buy 
bananas in the SLAC cafeteria 
because they’re radioactive [and 
would interfere with the sensitive 
detector],” he added.
The plan is to run the new 
detector for 1,000 days.

Special to The Tartan
We on Student Senate 
are constantly looking for 
ways to be responsive to stu-
dent needs and priorities so 
we can better serve them as 
your representatives. This 
semester, we’re branching 
out to reach new aspects of 
the student experience and 
communities across campus 
so we can grow as an orga-
nization and, in turn, help 
students ?ourish and make 
the most of the Carnegie 
Mellon experience.
To gain a better 
understanding of student 
needs, we are hosting Senate 
Week from Monday, Nov. 6 to 
Thursday, Nov. 9. Each day, 
we focus on branching out to 
a different aspect of the stu-
dent experience to seek input 
and ?nd ways to improve it.
On Monday, we are 
branching out to you, the stu-
dent. Since the student expe-
rience is core to the purpose 
of Senate, we value the on-
going relationships we have 
with the rest of campus. As 
such, we will be tabling out-
side of Doherty (rain loca-
tion: the Cohon Center) and 
providing a meeting point for 
students to meet their repre-
sentatives and an outlet for 
them to voice concerns. We 
will also be bringing back 
Scotty dog sweatshirt sales, 
and keep an eye out for free 
swag and food!
On Tuesday, we are 
branching out to your voices 
and honing in on being a body 
that is reactive to your needs. 
To better understand and 
serve you, we will be hosting 
an informal meet and greet 
in the Cohon Center Wright 
room from 6 to 8 p.m., where 
members of Senate will be 
available to talk to you indi-
vidually about any ideas or 
concerns you have. Topics 
may include diversity and 
inclusion, mental health and 
wellness resources, Sexual 
Assault and Relationship 
Violence (SARV) prevention, 
athletics, academic advising, 
student organization fund-
ing, and much more! We will 
also be launching Humans 
of CMU on this day, where 
we collect your stories and 
perspectives to create a mo-
saic of the Carnegie Mellon 
experience.
On Wednesday, we are 
branching out to your suc-
cess and seeking to under-
stand how best to provide 
you with the tools you need 
to ?ourish at Carnegie Mel-
lon. We will be hosting 
a forum on academic af-
fairs, as well as a series of 
?nance workshops, in the 
Cohon Center Class of 1987 
Room from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. 
Throughout these events, we 
are seeking to provide you 
with an outlet to voice con-
cerns and suggest changes to 
Carnegie Mellon’s academic 
policies that would allow 
you to succeed, as well as 
provide support and train-
ing on how to get funding 
through Senate and Carn-
egie Mellon for your organi-
zation so your organizations 
can succeed.
On Thursday, we are 
branching out to your com-
munities to bring people 
together and better under-
stand how we can support all 
areas of campus. We will be 
having an open conversation 
at our General Body Meeting 
in the Danforth Conference 
Room from 5 to 6:30 p.m., 
and we invite all members 
of campus to come listen to 
give input. We will be dis-
cussing what community-
speci?c needs students have, 
and how to better support 
campus leaders.
Come to any of the events 
from Tuesday to Thursday 
for free laptop stickers, food, 
and a chance to win a Scotty 
dog sweatshirt!

In a show of support to-
wards the Mellon College 
of Science (MCS), the Da-
vid Scaife Family (DSF) 
Charitable Foundation has 
donated $4 million to fund 
the creation of a block grant 
program for interdisciplin-
ary research projects in basic 
science. The grant program 
encourages research in fun-
damental avenues of science 
using a diverse range of dis-
ciplines, in order to serve as a 
lens to larger, more ground-
breaking projects in the life 
sciences and in biomedicine.
“Almost every big scientif-
ic discovery has started with 
basic science research, the 
same type of research that 
is being done in many of our 
labs at the Mellon College of 
Science,” said Rebecca W. 
Doerge, Dean of MCS, in a 
university press release.
The unique root of this in-
novative grant program lies 
in the opportunity it provides 
student researchers in MCS’ 
Departments of Biological 
Sciences, Chemistry, 
Mathematical Sciences, and 
Physics to work with collabo-
rators in other colleges. This 
helps foster greater creative 
thinking and innovation 
through an interdisciplinary 
approach.
“The future of science 
lies in fundamental, foun-
dational research done by 
cross-disciplinary collabora-
tions. The DSF Charitable 
Foundation is visionary in 
its willingness to support 
this type of work that will no 
doubt lead to the creation of 
tomorrow’s world-changing 
tools, technologies, and dis-
coveries,” said Doerge.
According to a university 
press release, DSF offers 
four types of grants, rang-
ing from $10,000 to $1 mil-
lion. They will fund research 
that investigates scienti?c 
inquiries with high societal 
impact but also will fund 
efforts that simply encour-
age the sharing of scienti?c 
knowledge. Smaller grants 
of up to $20,000 will fund 
workshops that foster trans-
disciplinary collaborations; 
grants of up to $150,000 will 
support the interdisciplin-
ary research of early career 
faculty and individual inves-
tigators; grants of $500,000 
will help teams of scientists 
from multiple schools ex-
pand their current research 
to reach transformative 
levels; a “moonshot” grant 
of $1 million will support a 
high-risk, high-reward chal-
lenge that brings together 
scientists from different 
?elds to collaborate on an 
impactful, yet dif?cult, sci-
enti?c question.
Grant applications 
will be vetted by a review 
committee, including the 
Dean of MCS and Carnegie 
Mellon’s provost. MCS is 
currently accepting applica-
tions for the workshop and 
early career and individual 
investigator grants.
DSF has given nearly $9 
million to Carnegie Mellon, 
with its largest gifts going to 
the creation and support of 
the Center for Nucleic Acids 
Science and Technology 
(CNAST). CNAST is an 
interdisciplinary research 
center in MCS that connects 
chemists, biologists, physi-
cists, and engineers to study 
DNA, RNA, and peptide 
nucleic acids to solve real-
world problems, including 
the diagnosis and treatment 
of infectious disease, neuro-
degenerative disorders, and 
cancer.
“Excellence in cross-
disciplinary collaboration 
is a hallmark of research at 
Carnegie Mellon University,” 
said Nick Beldecos, 
executive director of DSF, 
in a university press release. 
“The block grant program 
is intended to provide in-
vestigators with broad lati-
tude to pursue novel direc-
tions in work of this kind. 
We at DSF are excited to 
play a role in supporting re-
search that seeks to have a 
transformative impact on 
life science and, ultimately, 
human health.”

It Happens Here promotes transparency for acts of violence
SHRUTI MURALI
Assistant News Editor
Sexual Assault and Re-
lationship Violence (SARV) 
is a pressing issue in to-
day’s society, and affects 
a significant portion of 
Carnegie Mellon students. 
In the Spring of 2015, the 
university, in an effort to 
understand and assess the 
campus culture in regards 
to SARV, released a SARV 
study detailing instances 
of SARV among under-
graduate, graduate, and 
PhD students on campus. 
Of the individuals who 
responded to the survey, 
it was reported that 26 
percent of undergraduate 
women, nine percent of 
undergraduate men, eight 
percent of graduate wom-
en, and three percent of 
graduate men have experi-
enced sexual assault since 
they enrolled at Carnegie 
Mellon.
According to the Office 
of Title IX Initiatives, the 
results of the SARV Study 
have emphasized the need 
to increase awareness and 
healthy relationships while 
educating people about re-
lationship violence, teach 
community members how 
to identify signs of SARV, 
how to empower them to 
intervene when they rec-
ognize SARV in a relation-
ship, and to inform com-
munity members on how to 
report SARV. Several orga-
nizations work to promote 
awareness about SARV 
to the public and educate 
and empower individuals 
who have been affected by 
SARV. One such organiza-
tion is SAFE (SARV Activ-
ism for Everyone!), which 
was created by Carnegie 
Mellon students.
SAFE is a student 
group which aims to pre-
vent sexual assault and 
relationship violence on 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus 
by spreading awareness 
through activism. Initially 
known as Got Consent?, 
the organization changed 
its name to SAFE.
“We changed our name 
because we wanted to ex-
pand to cover all types of 
violence instead of just 
sexual violence,” said 
Naomi Shin, President of 
SAFE.
In their most recent 
event on Friday, Oct. 27, It 
Happens Here, the organi-
zation displayed artwork 
in the forms of paintings, 
drawings, poetry, and 
photography, among oth-
ers, to spread awareness 
about the impact of sexual 
assault and relationship 
violence and reveal stories 
of strength from sexual 
assault survivors.
“Our main message is 
simply a reminder that 
sexual assault and rela-
tionship violence aren’t 
foreign things — they hap-
pen to your classmates, 
your friends, and can even 
happen to you,” said Shin.
Among the artwork 
displayed was a 
contemporary piece 
depicting an ironing board 
with a printed sheet of an 
arm. Behind the ironing 
board was a clothesline 
dangling with printed 
sheets depicting arms, 
legs, and a naked body. 
In addition to this pow-
erful work of art was a 
poem titled, “Phoenix,” 
expressing the innermost 
feelings of an individual 
surviving sexual assault 
and how they were able 
to rise from the ashes 
even after their difficult 
experiences. Red wooden 
statues outlining the bod-
ies of women held stories 
of horrific cases of sexual 
assault. A table was dis-
played in the corner with 
paintings and stories by 
children raised in abusive 
homes. A video playing 
in the background voiced 
advice to survivors from 
other survivors of sexual 
assault. They were laden 
with words of strength and 
determination to empower 
individuals to stand up 
for themselves and their 
safety.
“Through this event, we 
wanted to serve and help 
survivors in our communi-
ty by giving them an outlet 
while also impacting other 
members of Carnegie Mel-
lon by inspiring people to 
take a couple of minutes 
from their days to think 
about tough topics like 
SARV and hopefully be 
more mindful of what they 
see with their peers,” said 
Shin.
It Happens Here was 
first proposed last year by 
the organization’s advisor, 
Jess Klein. The organiza-
tion decided to continue 
the event because of its 
effectiveness in raising 
awareness of domestic 
violence in a unique and 
creative manner. SAFE has 
also hosted other events to 
raise awareness of SARV.
“Last semester, we held 
Take Back the Night, a 
national initiative that is 
held slightly differently 
depending on the host. 
SAFE held it in the form of 
a mini protest/march lead-
ing to a safe space discus-
sion in the [Cohon Center] 
where survivors could talk 
about their experiences,” 
said Shin.
Through their varied 
efforts, SAFE is working 
towards spreading aware-
ness about sexual assault 
and relationship violence 
to Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents. They emphasize the 
gravity of the issue, and 
present ways to prevent 
and recognize SARV, as 
well as how to report it.
The organization 
encourages members of 
the Carnegie Mellon com-
munity who have been im-
pacted by sexual violence, 
relationship violence, 
stalking, or sexual harass-
ment to report their con-
cerns to the Office of Title

combat what she saw as the 
problem that “the bene?ts 
of free trade, democracy, 
and globalization have 
been called into question.” 
She felt that “deepening 
democratic reforms,” by 
strengthening commer-
cial ties with the rest of the 
world, attempting to create 
a robust middle class, and 
“advocating for a peaceful 
resolution to international 
con?ict,” which she felt was 
a particular strength of the 
region, could not only sta-
bilize Latin America socially 
and economically but could 
serve to combat anti-global-
ist sentiment.
She views this anti-glo-
balist sentiment as inherent-
ly detrimental to democracy 
regardless of the ideologi-
cal foundations, stating “it 
doesn’t matter if it is from 
the left or from the right, 
populism itself is something 
really terrible for a democ-
racy because it does not 
have any kind of ideology,” 
when asked about left-wing 
populist movements in the 
U.S.
The points Chinchilla 
made in her talk strongly 
re?ected her agenda dur-
ing her tenure as president. 
In of?ce, she reduced crime 
rates and combated the cor-
ruption that she so derided 
in her talk. She cited edu-
cation as a means to avert 
populism, and it was under 
presidency that the Costa 
Rican constitution was 
amended to mandate that 
eight percent of the govern-
ment’s money be spent on 
education.
Her experience also led 
her to warn the audience 
against viewing the shift 
from autocracy to democra-
cy as a permanent one. The 
work she has done after her 
presidency, such as leading 
Electoral Observation Mis-
sions for the Organization of 
American States in the U.S. 
and Mexico, demonstrates 
her commitment to rein-
forcing the norms of inter-
national liberal democracy 
in political and academic 
spaces.

Since the country was found-
ed, the rhetoric of U.S. immigra-
tion policy has been a major focus 
of politicians. This holds espe-
cially true for the most recent 
presidential election cycle. Cur-
rent U.S. President Donald Trump 
quite literally made the “wall” — 
metaphorical or physical — the 
slogan of his campaign, proposing 
a supposedly simple and clear-cut 
strategy to magically solve all the 
problems going on in this nation 
by keeping the people he views as 
inferior out.
As ridiculous as this kind of 
argument sounds, Trump went 
on to become the most powerful 
man in the country and is now 
implementing a plan against im-
migration in a country that was 
essentially built on immigration.
And yes, it’s sadly true that 
you have probably heard this ar-
gument enough times that you 
have grown numb to the unfortu-
nate situations of undocumented 
immigrants; there’s not much you 
can do about it, because you are 
probably just an idealistic, pow-
erless student. The situation is 
probably not that relatable any-
way, because most of us at the 
university are either protected by 
the country as citizens or perma-
nent residents, or are here with a 
valid visa, which means we don’t 
have to worry too much about 
being deported for literally just 
breathing the air in the United 
States. Maybe you even devel-
oped some kind of psychological 
coping mechanism and have al-
ready accepted the fact that life is 
just unfair like this. But for some, 
the problem is far more pressing, 
and far harder to escape.
Earlier this week, a children’s 
health facility in San Antonio, 
TX received ten-year-old Maria 
Hernandez, who has cerebral 
palsy. She was rushed to the 
hospital to undergo emergency 
gallbladder surgery. Her mother, 
who lives in Laredo illegally, 
could not come with her past the 
checkpoint north of the city. She is 
not alone, however. Her hospital 
room is guarded by police from 
Border Patrol, waiting to deport 
her right after she is released 
from the hospital.
And her way to the hospital was 
not exactly smooth. Diagnosed 
with several kidney stones 
about a month ago, Hernandez’s 
doctor said she would need 
an emergency gallbladder 
surgery. Her ambulance was, 
however, stopped at the border 
to Texas that is located after 
Laredo because of the new hard-
line policy put in place by the 
Trump administration. She was 
detained at the border with all 
other juvenile undocumented 
immigrants before she was sent to 
the hospital, accompanied by the 
police. She is effectively arrested 
and waiting to be deported at the 
moment, despite her disability 
and the fact that she is still 
waiting for treatment.
According to President 
Trump’s logic, preventing im-
migrants from coming into the 
country will solve monetary and 
security problems, and strength-
ening the border by pouring 
taxpayer money into expanding 
police forces is the only way to 
go. Trump’s administration not 
only beefed up the manpower 
at the southern U.S. border but 
also changed the priority of the 
deportation process. Prior to this 
administration, U.S. police forces 
focused on deporting criminals 
and other individuals that could 
pose harm to society. A lot less 
emphasis was placed on the un-
documented immigrants who 
found work and a shelter in the 
U.S. and lived up to all the expec-
tations and laws with the only ex-
ception of one missing document.
But now this landscape has 
changed. The administration 
gives all illegal and undocument-
ed immigrants the same priority, 
meaning that anyone who stays 
in the United States without valid 
identi?cation will be deported 
immediately. This policy abuses 
the “expedited removal,” a pro-
cess put in place by earlier admin-
istrations to speed up the process 
of removal of criminals and avoid 
prison over?owing by skipping 
the process of going through a 
judge.
This abuse of expedited re-
moval is an attempt to cut down 
the cost of deporting harmless ci-
vilians who most likely just want 
to work in the United States, but 
there lies an irony so glaring that 
it’s hard to overlook: the money, 
time, and manpower that go into 
hunting down illegal immigrants 
and stopping them from coming 
into and staying in the country 
is ridiculous, and could be spent 
on doing more productive things, 
such as stopping children from 
dying. Somehow “turning our na-
tion into an emergency room for 
the rest of the world” — the words 
of George Rodriguez, a conserva-
tive politician — is worse than 
blowing piles of cash to make sure 
that a disabled girl is detained 
and will get deported at the end 
of her treatment, arresting people 
who are working hard and try-
ing to make a living in the United 
States, and building a physical 
wall at the southern border of the 
United States, which might have 
been a great strategy over a thou-
sand years ago in China to keep 
the Huns outside the border, but 
is almost certainly outdated in a 
world where people can just casu-
ally ?y across the border by pur-
chasing an airplane ticket. The 
entire “saving money” consider-
ation seems to break down when 
you really look into these aspects 
of the policy.
The homeland security argu-
ment, which seems like a some-
what valid concern at ?rst, is 
also full of irony in the execution 
of the policy. How exactly is the 
administration going to make 
America a safer place when they 
spend all their time, manpower, 
and money on deporting people 
who are not threats to society? 
This change may create more jobs 
— we will need a lot more police-
men to make sure that the undoc-
umented criminals get deported 
— but just keep in mind that all 
that money could be spent on 
curing the sick instead of keeping 
them out of the hospital.
The fact that the government 
implements policies like this 
should disturb you every time. 
The majority of the people who 
call themselves “Americans” come 
from somewhere else, or their an-
cestors are from somewhere else. 
You could argue that you, or your 
ancestors, deserve to be treated 
better by the government because 
you are a part of the reasons why 
this nation turns out to be suc-
cessful and strong, but also keep 
in mind that most of these im-
migrants left their homeland to 
produce their own successes, and 
they are making the nation stron-
ger. It should disturb you that the 
government uses the money you 
make to watch people who need 
help die right in front of their 
eyes. We must make lawmakers 
aware that we will not stand for 
such deprivation of human rights 
just because someone is not a citi-
zen of the U.S.

Although sexual misconduct 
is not a new topic, it is one that 
has generated many discussions 
recently. Brock Turner sparked 
national outrage after receiving 
a mere three months prison time 
for raping a woman and is again 
brought back by a criminology 
textbook that used him as the text-
book de?nition of a rapist. Harvey 
Weinstein is now facing allegation 
after allegation, testimony after 
testimony. Now, Kevin Spacey, 
star of House of Cards, has found 
himself exposed for sexual mis-
conduct, and the show will be can-
celed after the completion of this 
season.
What was once considered 
a relatively taboo topic is now 
discussed more, albeit still stig-
matized to a signi?cant degree. 
Social media platforms, most no-
tably Twitter, saw an explosion of 
people tweeting “#MeToo,” indi-
cating that they were victims of 
sexual misconduct. Although it is 
great that dialogue is continuing, 
there have been concerns that the 
extent of which it is being brought 
up is bringing a hysteria of rape 
cases and possibly creating false 
rape accusations.
Some are concerned that this 
will add to the rape culture hys-
teria. Although the “one in four” 
statistic has been shown to have 
been misleading and derived from 
a non-representative sample, this 
is still spread around and leads 
to even well-established news or-
ganizations such as The New York 
Times to use it in their headlines. 
Already, there are statistics that 
overestimate the prevalence of 
sexual misconduct; how would 
campaigns such as “#MeToo” af-
fect our society? Could it possibly 
overestimate people’s perceptions 
of the likelihood of rape cases and 
thus lead to false reports?
It is naïve to believe that there 
will be no false rape accusation 
from this point forward in time, 
and frankly, no rational person 
would believe that the possibility 
of a false rape accusation does not 
exist. However, the chances of sex-
ual misconduct going unreported 
appear to signi?cantly  supersede 
the probability of a false accusa-
tion. In 2015, just over two-thirds 
of rape cases were not reported 
to the police whereas the rate of 
a false rape allegation appears to 
be no  higher than ten percent of 
all cases. Although the number of 
false rape accusations may go up 
in sheer numbers, the number of 
true rape accusations that actually 
go through the legal process will 
go up too, more likely at a faster 
rate. Of course, we need to ensure 
a just and fair trial for each case to 
ensure that the fewest perpetra-
tors possible are found innocent 
and the fewest false perpetrators 
are not punished, but it is worth 
noting that the likelihood of a case 
going unreported is far greater 
than a false case being ?led.
Something to keep in mind is 
that a study conducted by social 
scientists who analyze crime    re-
cords estimate that the rate of false 
rape allegations falls between two 
to ten percent of all cases made. 
There are clear ?aws made within 
this study. The sample includes 
only female victims on a college 
campus, which is not the only pop-
ulation affected by sexual miscon-
duct by a long shot. Additionally, 
the study ran from 1998 to 2007, 
running a great risk of possibly be-
ing outdated. Most of all, however, 
the de?nition of false rape allega-
tion means that the allegation is 
provably false — meaning, there 
is either conclusive proof that the 
rape did not occur or the accuser 
recants. However, in this study, 
their de?nition also includes cases 
in which there is not enough evi-
dence to conclude that the rape 
did or did not occur. Despite these 
?aws, the study demonstrates that 
the number of allegations that end 
up to be true signi?cantly outnum-
bers the ones that are either incon-
clusive or false.
I was one of the thousands who 
posted “#MeToo” on their social 
media platforms, and as someone 
looking internally within, there 
are clear ?aws with the move-
ment. There are criticisms that 
claim that it can invade privacy 
or otherwise pressure people to 
publicly share their story even if 
they personally do not feel com-
fortable. Another possible criti-
cism is that the campaign focuses 
predominately on cisgender 
women. Even though this is the 
demographic we often picture as 
victims of sexual misconduct, the 
statistics say that this is not inclu-
sive. Transgender victims are of-
ten left out of the picture. A stag-
gering number of cisgender males 
are victims, yet the dialogue for 
sexual misconduct often does not 
include cases outside of the male-
perpetrator-female-victim para-
digm. Even researching online 
and looking through the method-
ology of the case studies reported, 
a signi?cant portion of the studies 
conducted had a strictly cisgender 
female sample. Looking forward, 
we must continue maintaining 
dialogue and informing others so 
that they can get the help and jus-
tice that they deserve, but we, as 
a society, also must do a better job 
at including a fairer sample that 
truly represents our diverse popu-
lation, not just a mere fraction.
We may not, unfortunately, be 
able to completely eliminate sex-
ual misconduct. However, we can 
take measures to prevent it and 
better help victims. We can share 
resources, such as the    National 
Sexual Assault Hotline number at 
(800.656.HOPE). We can encour-
age people to seek their nearest 
emergency room after the inci-
dent. We can continue to educate 
people on the meaning of con-
sent (no, silence does not equal 
consent), and we can break the 
paradigm that the cases of sexual 
misconduct lie mainly in the male-
perpetrator-female-victim pattern. 
We can demand a healthcare sys-
tem that will give better access 
for victims to seek psychological 
and psychiatric treatment so that 
money will not hinder them from 
getting the help they need.
Any of these things can increase 
the number of claims of sexual 
misconduct, which can possibly 
raise the number of false cases 
made. However, we cannot let the 
fear of a relatively small chance of 
a false claim being made stop us 
from reaching out to victims and 
ensure that they get access to jus-
tice and a path towards healing.

Trump’s pick for head of NASA insults science and progress
JENNY YU
Junior Staffwriter
The National Aeronautics 
Space Administration (NASA) 
is a dream-maker — an inspira-
tion for children to go into the 
sciences and a professional aspi-
ration for students and adults in 
the sciences. It has been the cor-
nerstone of a number of momen-
tous leaps in scientific progress, 
both in the history of our nation 
and in the world. From the moon 
landing to research on the Big 
Bang, NASA forefronts develop-
ments in aerospace science and 
collaborates with a number of 
other nations and international 
organizations.
For an organization as 
important as NASA, surely the 
President, who is entrusted 
with the duty of appointing an 
administrator, would want it to 
be headed by someone who can 
embody all those advances that it 
has made and will make, who can 
stand for the name of science and 
pushing boundaries. As many 
of us have seen, however, the 
Trump administration has made 
many decisions that are anything 
but expected (which, in its own 
way, may not be so surprising).
President Donald Trump 
has recently made the move of 
nominating Congressman Jim 
Bridenstine (R-OK) for NASA’s 
next administrator. It would be 
certainly unfair to immediately 
draw the conclusion that 
Bridenstine is unqualified at first 
glance, for Bridenstine is not 
without political experience nor 
administrative experience. In 
fact, he has been a director of the 
Tulsa Air and Space Museum and 
Planetarium in the past, along 
with his career as a politician.
And yet eyebrows are raised, 
however, after a careful scrutiny 
of some of his positions and view-
points. First and foremost, he is a 
climate change denier. For some-
one in such a position of power, 
especially over a major scien-
tific organization that spends a 
significant amount of its budget 
on climate research, to deny a 
stance that has achieved almost 
unanimous scientific consensus 
relays a poignant message, and 
that message is not one that our 
nation should be proud to relay.
It is not often in recent his-
tory that scientists reach such an 
overwhelming, universal consen-
sus on a viewpoint, but when it 
does happen, as is the case with 
climate change, others should lis-
ten. Instead, Bridenstine ignores 
the overwhelming evidence and 
research against his perspective 
and clouds science with politics.
Research, space exploration, 
climate change — these should 
not be tarnished with ulterior 
motives or agendas by politicians. 
They are about satiating an in-
nate human curiosity present in 
all of us, not about attempting to 
create discordant feelings within 
the nation by blaming climate 
change as a hoax created by the 
Chinese, or about furthering cor-
porate interest by cutting down 
on environmental protections.
Politics should not play as 
large a role in science and the 
environment as it currently does, 
and by nominating Bridenstine, 
President Trump has allowed his 
own personal agenda to infiltrate 
science once again.
Furthermore, the appointed 
administrator is as much a lead-
er of NASA as a figurehead and 
symbol. Bridenstine’s reputation 
and potential actions will be im-
portant in determining how we, 
as a nation, are to be perceived 
by foreign as well as domestic 
powers. We will be, if we aren’t 
already, laughingstocks of the 
world should we appoint to the 
scientific stage someone who 
vocally and falsely claimed on 
the floor of Congress that global 
temperatures stopped rising 10 
years ago.
So then what implications 
would all of this hold for the fu-
ture of NASA as an organization? 
No doubt, the budget on climate 
research would be curtailed. 
While Bridenstine also does seem 
invested in space exploration, his 
reasons for it lie in the commer-
cial side, for example, citing his 
desire for further lunar expedi-
tions as a means of exploiting the 
moon’s resources.
There is a chance, of course, 
that my evaluation of Briden-
stine as a person and as a politi-
cal figure is completely off the 
mark, that he might turn out to 
be a good fit for the job, some-
one who will change NASA for 
the better. There is a much larger 
chance, however, that we have 
valid reasons to be concerned, 
judging by his statements and 
stances — and by Trump’s pro-
pensity for continuously nomi-
nating unfit candidates for na-
tional offices.
Only time will tell, but if 
nothing else, at least Trump has 
consistency.

We promised two weeks ago 
that this column would soon 
broaden its scope and tackle 
topics related to America, and 
not simply Carnegie Mellon. 
Today’s topic will fulfill that 
promise, as I will develop a 
reflection about money, how 
people in the U.S. see it, and what 
the consequences of this relation 
are in the American society. 
The point is less 
to state a moral judgment than 
to give some general sense and 
coherence to several interesting 
phenomena. In this process, I 
will touch on several important 
issues that could each merit a 
full article — but we won’t try to 
treat them exhaustively.
It is indeed a well-known 
cliché that in America money 
occupies a very specific place — 
bigger than it is in Europe, for 
example. Here “money talks,” as 
they say. Although we will try to 
go further in the next paragraphs, 
this platitude is a good starting 
point, as my personal experience 
over the last few months tends to 
confirm. To put it in a nutshell, 
here in America, everything has 
a price.
I can think of three types of 
situations where this principle 
becomes particularly obvious. 
First, there are extremely ex-
pensive services here that are 
free, more affordable, or sub-
stantially government-funded in 
many other countries. The ex-
ample that comes immediately 
to mind is healthcare, which in 
the U.S. requires people to pay 
thousands of dollars a year in 
health insurance. 
Equivalent ser-
vices in most 
developed 
countries would cost several 
times less — when they are not 
free or reimbursed. This does not 
mean that everybody agrees with 
this situation, of course — but 
the mere fact that it exists states 
something about the American 
society. Another example, famil-
iar to the student community, 
is education: tuition fees in the 
U.S. are probably the highest in 
the world. Of course, it comes 
with the best campuses and re-
searchers, and scholarships exist 
to help those who cannot afford 
an education on their own. Still, 
education’s price in the U.S. is 
dictated by the law of the mar-
ket, like any other commodity 
— despite the pressure it puts on 
students, as described in this col-
umn last week.
Let’s move to a second type 
of situation. Like 
services are 
costly, even 
the most vital 
ones, jobs 
can be paid 
no matter 
how minute 
they might 
seem. I took 
notice of this 
on a recent 
trip to New 
York, when a 
homeless person entered the bar 
I was in to collect empty cans 
and bottles. Actually, I didn’t 
understand what was happening 
at the moment; only later a 
friend explained to me that 
redeeming recyclables was a way 
to make a living for the poorest 
people. I understand well how it 
can be justified: bringing back 
recyclables to centers is a useful 
action that can be paid, and if 
giving this task to people in need 
can help them survive, so much 
the better. And yet, knowing that 
this practice has turned into a 
nation-wide service of people 
wandering streets all night to 
collect cans and earn five dollars 
is somehow a bit shocking in my 
opinion. It sort of evokes a South 
Park episode (like this recent 
one where unemployed rednecks 
get paid for doing 
Amazon Echo’s 
job in houses) 
or, if you’re pessimistic, a Black 
Mirror pitch.
The third kind of situation 
I am thinking about is a social 
relation. In America more than 
anywhere, I get the feeling that 
being nice to people is part of a 
job and deserves a payment — 
the tip of the iceberg being, well, 
tips. I have always been used to 
service included in almost every 
context, and having in every bar, 
every restaurant, to choose an 
amount — to judge with cash 
how friendly and helpful some-
one has been — is quite a change. 
In my opinion, you pay for a ser-
vice, and being nice isn’t part of 
the service, it’s just how you’re 
supposed to act in social rela-
tions. And symmetrically I know 
there are Americans back from 
Europe who were just as sur-
prised as I was, saying in shock 
“back there service is included, 
so nothing forced the waiter to 
be nice to me, I had to engage a 
conversation.” This is definitely a 
strong cultural gap, which I think 
is related to that same gen-
eral American principle 
that everything comes 
with a price.
Before concluding 
this article there is a 
small paradox I would like 
to describe. Despite the 
importance that money can 
have in the U.S., I have been 
amazed by the lack of caution 
that is given to means of pay-
ments here. For example, to pay 
my rent, I basically just entered 
my account’s coordinates on the 
estate agent’s website, when I 
would have expected to confirm 
to my bank at least once that I au-
thorize the payment. How could 
you prevent fraud with such a 
system? Another example is the 
fact that in restaurants, you often 
specify the tipping amount after 
having given and taken back your 
card — so they will edit the deb-
ited amount after you are gone. 
The insecurity related to money 
seems disproportionate to its im-
portance, which I am unable to 
explain for now.
In some future articles, I will 
try to push further this analysis. 
I believe that the current topic, 
although central in any analysis 
of American society, could be 
linked to equally fundamental 
topics, in particular, those of 
individual responsibility and 
contractual relations. But this is 
for another week.

One reason suicide is so 
unfortunately dif?cult to 
predict and prevent is be-
cause of its unpredictabil-
ity. In some cases, suicidal 
people choose to conceal 
their struggles and scars, 
so on the outside they 
may seem perfectly ?ne. 
When they take their own 
life, they leave behind a 
trail of unanswered ques-
tions and regrets — “Why 
didn’t I see this coming? 
What could I have done 
to help them?” The con-
sistency in high suicide 
rates is such a dark and 
alarming phenomenon 
that would be easy to take 
down if we could know 
when someone in depres-
sion turns their thoughts 
into action.
Researchers at 
Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity and the University of 
Pittsburgh may have tak-
en us a step closer to sui-
cide prevention. On Oct. 
30, Professor Marcel Just 
from CMU and Professor 
David Brent from Pitt an-
nounced that they have 
developed an approach to 
identify individuals with 
suicidal thoughts by ana-
lyzing brain activity when 
they think of concepts like 
death or cruelty. Just and 
Brent used fMRI to moni-
tor the neural responses 
of 34 subjects — 17 sui-
cidal, 17 control subjects 
— to a list of 30 words. 
The list contained words 
with positive, negative, 
and suicidal connota-
tions, and the researchers 
asked each participant to 
think for three seconds 
about each word. They 
then recorded cerebral 
blood ?ow to infer which 
parts of the brain were 
activated. An algorithm 
was then used to differ-
entiate whether or not the 
participant had suicidal 
thoughts.
Just and Brent were 
able to ?nd that the 
algorithm successfully 
classi?es a participant as 
“suicidal” 91 percent of 
the time. They found that 
six words were especially 
good predictors that acti-
vated certain areas of the 
brain much more than 
other words: death, cruel-
ty, trouble, carefree, good, 
and praise. They then fo-
cused on the six words and 
used a similar approach to 
test if the algorithm could 
identify the participants 
who had experience of a 
suicide attempt or self-
harm. They were able to 
?nd that the algorithm 
could accurately ?nd the 
participants who had at-
tempted to take their lives 
with 94 percent accuracy.
These results open the 
window for so many new 
potential applications 
in psychiatry. According 
to Professor Brent, “the 
most immediate need is 
to apply these ?ndings 
to a much larger sample 
and then use it to predict 
future suicide attempts. 
It could give clinicians in 
the future a way to iden-
tify, monitor and perhaps 
intervene with the altered 
and often distorted think-
ing that so often charac-
terizes seriously suicidal 
individuals.”
Not only do the results 
of this research help clini-
cians identify individuals 
with suicidal thoughts, 
but they also suggest new 
methods of treatment 
and therapy for those in 
depression. The study 
showed that the concept 
of “death” evoked rela-
tively more shame and 
sadness in the group of 
participants that had 
thought about suicide. 
This information can eas-
ily be used by psychiatrists 
to gear their therapy to 
tailor the speci?c emo-
tional needs of their pa-
tients.
However, this does 
not mean that the tech-
nique is perfect. Accord-
ing to science magazine 
WIRED, fMRI scans have 
certain shortcomings that 
suggest they may not be 
perfectly accurate indica-
tors of brain activity. Es-
pecially with a relatively 
small sample size of 34 
participants, it is dif?cult 
to guarantee that the al-
gorithm will be successful 
for every single individual 
with suicidal thoughts.
It’s also extremely cru-
cial not to confuse corre-
lation with causation. Just 
because two things occur 
at the same time doesn’t 
prove that one causes the 
other — in this case, more 
testing would be neces-
sary to indisputably prove 
that the suicidal thoughts 
caused distinct brain ac-
tivity. According to Pro-
fessor Just, “comparing 
groups of individuals 
with or without suicide 
risk isn’t the same thing 
as holding up a brain scan 
and assigning its owner 
a likelihood of going 
through with it.”
But the results of their 
study de?nitely point us in 
the right direction. A study 
published in the Journal of 
Clinical Psychiatry showed 
that nearly 80 percent of 
the people who commit-
ted suicide in the hospi-
tal or immediately after 
discharge denied think-
ing about suicide to their 
assigned medical profes-
sional. This serves to show 
how reluctant people with 
dark thoughts may be 
to share their emotional 
states, and how the need 
for a method to scien-
ti?cally and methodically 
predict suicide is growing. 
Clearly, it’s better to know 
the brain is doing some-
thing than knowing noth-
ing at all.

CMU, Pitt team identi?es suicidal individuals with fMRI
Scientists conduct “delayed choice” experiment in space
NAVIYA SINGLA
SciTech Editor
A photon, or a quan-
tum of light, has been 
known to have both wave-
like and particle like prop-
erties. It can behave like a 
speeding bullet-like parti-
cle or like a rippling wave, 
depending on the way it 
is studied, but not both at 
the same time. This un-
certainty, in some sense, 
is the essence of quantum 
physics.
Between 1978 and 
1984, James Archibald 
Wheeler — a pioneer 
in theoretical physics, 
proposed a series of ex-
periments to ?gure out 
whether photons “under-
stand” their surrounding, 
and “chooses” to change 
its behavior depending on 
the system it is in. 
While Wheeler’s pro-
posed experiments have 
been performed several 
times, and by many dif-
ferent scientists on Earth, 
this is the ?rst time these 
experiments have been 
performed in outer space. 
Francesco Vedovato 
and Paolo Villoresi of 
the University of Padua, 
and their team have at-
tempted to perform one 
of Wheeler’s proposed 
experiments using a 
1.5-meter telescope at 
the Matera Laser Rang-
ing Observatory. Firing 
green laser pulses at the 
Beacon-C and Starlette 
satellites was part of the 
experiment.
The experiment in-
volved passing a laser 
beam through a beam 
splitter which would split 
it into two, differently po-
larize them (one horizon-
tal and one vertical) and 
then send the two beams 
of lights into space. One of 
the beams was on a longer 
path, which made it lag 
behind. These two beams 
were then re?ected off 
a satellite, subjected to 
a possible swap of their 
polarizations based on 
a random signal from 
a computer, and then 
passed through the beam 
splitter again. If their po-
larizations were swapped, 
the gap between the two 
beams would widen, 
making them both behave 
like particles. If it wasn’t 
reversed, then the two 
waves would combine, 
making the light behave 
as waves.
The random signal, 
that controls the polar-
ization in the second half 
of the experiment (after 
the re?ection off the sat-
ellite), is the “delayed 
choice” part of the ex-
periment. This “delayed 
choice” refers to the fact 
the light that is being 
bounced off the satellite 
has no way of “knowing” 
whether it should be a 
particle or a wave, and 
therefore shouldn’t be 
able to “choose” to behave 
in a certain way.
This simply con?rms 
the fact that most behav-
ior of objects in the uni-
verse is undetermined 
until forces act on them, 
to force them to behave in 
a certain way. 
Jean-François Roch, 
a physicist at the École 
Normale Supérieure in 
Paris, who conducted a 
more stringent version of 
Wheeler’s experiments in 
2007 said in an article in 
Science, “This area where 
you mix quantum me-
chanics and relativity is 
still relatively unexplored, 
… and this is the sort of 
experiment that raised 
the possibility of probing 
the link” between the two.
The team’s ?ndings 
were published in Science 
Advances on Oct. 25.

New arti?cial cells can produce insulin for diabetic people 
People with diabetes 
are unable to produce in-
sulin in their own body 
due to dysfunctional beta 
islet cells in the pancreas, 
which naturally produce 
insulin.
In the October 2017 
online version of Nature 
Chemical Biology, research-
ers published a study 
called “Synthetic beta cells 
for fusion-mediated dy-
namic insulin secretion” 
about cells they syntheti-
cally made in the lab that 
produce insulin similar to 
how beta islet cells do. The 
cells were injected into 
diabetic mice. The experi-
ment showed that the cells 
can regulate blood sugar 
for up to ?ve days.
Diabetes affects more 
than 400 million people 
worldwide. According to 
the American Diabetes 
Association, around 30 
million people in the Unit-
ed States have diabetes. 
Currently, people with dia-
betes have to check their 
blood sugar level several 
times a day and manually 
inject insulin. With this 
study, arti?cial cells can 
provide a viable treatment 
for patients in the future 
and have a lot of possibil-
ity. According to Science 
News, “unlike transplanted 
beta cells — or other types 
of real cells genetically en-
gineered to release insulin 
for diabetes treatment — 
these arti?cial cells could 
be mass-produced and 
have a much longer shelf 
life than live cells.”

Planetary system may be closer than previously believed
The closest star to our 
Sun is called Proxima 
Centauri. Since 2010, 
researchers have known 
that Proxima Centauri is 
orbited by a terrestrial 
planet, Proxima Centauri 
b. 
Recently, an observa-
tory in Chile has discov-
ered a dust cloud around 
Proxima Centauri, sig-
naling the possibility of a 
planetary system.
“The dust around 
Proxima is important be-
cause, following the dis-
covery of the terrestrial 
planet Proxima Centauri 
b, it’s the ?rst indication 
of the presence of an elab-
orate planetary system, 
and not just a single plan-
et, around the star closest 
to our Sun,” said lead au-
thor Guillem Anglada. 
“This result suggests 
that Proxima Centauri 
may have a multiple plan-
et system with a rich his-
tory of interactions that 
resulted in the formation 
of a dust belt. Further 
study may also provide 
information that might 
point to the locations of 
as yet unidenti?ed addi-
tional planets.”
There are rudimentary 
plans in place to explore 
the this planetary system, 
primarily a project called 
Starshot. Starshot, which 
has support from famous 
scientists like Stephen 
Hakwing, plans to send 
probes to Proxima Cen-
tauri on tiny, ultralight 
spacecraft powered by so-
lar sails.

New orangutan species could go extinct soon
Until recently, scien-
tists believed there to be 
only two species of orang-
utan — Sumatran and 
Bornean. However, a new 
species of orangutan has 
been discovered, called 
Pongo tapanuliensis. 
They were discovered 
in Batang Toru forest 
in Sumatra, Indonesia. 
While the two known spe-
cies of orangutan are al-
ready on the endangered 
species list, this new spe-
cies is estimated to only 
contain 800 individuals.
“The Batang Toru 
orangutans appear to 
be direct descendants 
of the initial orangutans 
that had migrated from 
mainland Asia, and thus 
constitute the oldest evo-
lutionary line within the 
genus Pongo,” said study 
co-author Alexander 
Nater of the University of 
Zurich, in a statement to 
The Verge.
“Great apes are among 
the best-studied species 
in the world,” said study 
co-author Erik Meijaard 
of the Australian National 
University. 
“If after 200 years of se-
rious biological research 
we can still ?nd new spe-
cies in this group, what 
does it tell us about all 
the other stuff that we 
are overlooking: hidden 
species, unknown ecologi-
cal relationships, critical 
thresholds we shouldn’t 
cross?”

Scientists attempt to study the role of evolution in psychiatric disorders
EMMA FLICKINGER
Assistant SciTech Editor
Genes are at least partly 
responsible for most psy-
chiatric disorders. But if 
certain genes cause severe 
problems like schizophre-
nia, why hasn’t evolution 
eliminated them?
The evolution of psychi-
atric disorders has histori-
cally been dif?cult for re-
searchers to study because 
most psychiatric disorders 
are polygenic (in?uenced 
by many genes, not just by 
a single allele). The number 
of genes causing a psychiat-
ric disorder to be expressed 
can be in the hundreds or 
thousands. To learn more 
about the disorder’s evo-
lution, researchers must 
sequence each of these ge-
netic regions and ?gure out 
how they’ve changed over 
time. This requires access to 
huge amounts of data on the 
human genome, something 
hard to come by. Accord-
ing to biology writer Sara 
Reardon, “But, the advent 
of massive human genome 
databases is enabling re-
searchers to look for pos-
sible connections between 
mental illnesses and the 
environmental and societal 
conditions that might have 
driven their emergence and 
development.”
Biologists around the 
world are exploring these 
connections in unique ways. 
By looking for correlations 
in huge datasets, Yale ge-
neticist Renato Polimanti is 
trying to uncover relations 
between environmental 
factors and the expression 
of mental illnesses. His 
team examined thousands 
of genetic samples and en-
vironmental data points 
from across Europe, and 
found that people in colder 
regions had a higher risk 
for schizophrenia. Reardon 
writes, “If genes that helped 
people tolerate cold were 
located close to variants 
that promote schizophre-
nia in the genome, then 
the latter could have been 
inadvertently carried along 
during evolution as a fel-
low traveler.” However, the 
correlation may not be so 
straightforward, Reardon 
continues: “unknown envi-
ronmental conditions in the 
past could have selected for 
traits that were advanta-
geous then, but considered 
negative today.”
Bernard Crespi, an evo-
lutionary biologist at Simon 
Fraser University, explains 
that schizophrenia is tightly 
tied to parts of the brain that 
allow us to produce speech. 
If the genes for speech and 
the schizophrenia genes 
are closely related, it’s pos-
sible that the speech genes 
were prioritized in human 
evolution, bringing schizo-
phrenia genes along for the 
ride in a mechanism similar 
to Polimanti’s ‘cold’ gene 
hypothesis.
In another approach, bi-
ologists are comparing the 
genetic processes of mod-
ern humans to Neander-
thals to learn more about 
how genes evolved. Tony 
Capra and Laura Colbran, 
geneticists at Vanderbilt 
University, are studying 
how the same exact genes 
are expressed differently in 
the two species. For exam-
ple, both modern humans 
and Neanderthals carry 
the gene FOXP2, associ-
ated with language, but our 
abilities to use language are 
greater. 
One explanation is that 
differences in the way 
FOXP2 is processed al-
lows modern humans to 
produce more of the pro-
tein encoded by FOXP2. 
Capra and Colbran’s team 
hope that by learning more 
about Neanderthal brains, 
they will be able to ?nd out 
whether they experienced 
psychiatric disorders the 
same way humans do today.
Our understanding of 
the evolution of mental 
illness is still developing. 
However, as more genetic 
databases become avail-
able, existing research can 
be con?rmed and expand-
ed, and new research can 
be developed.

The ninth-ranked 
Carnegie Mellon volleyball 
team topped Brandeis 
University 3–2 in the open-
ing round of the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
Championship on Friday af-
ternoon. The Tartans started 
as the number one seed for 
the tournament which was 
hosted by Emory University.
The Tartans (28–3) 
fell behind a set when the 
Judges (15–12) won set one 
by a 25–21 score. In a back-
and-forth second set, the 
Tartans prevailed 30–28 af-
ter three straight kills to end 
the match, with the ?rst two 
coming from sophomore 
Sahara Aqui and the set win-
ner off the hands of junior 
Lauren Mueller, who had 
?ve kills in the set.
The Tartans jumped out 
to a 10–4 lead in the third 
set before extending the 
lead to 16–8. First-year Julia 
Kim served three straight 
points, starting with an ace, 
to give the Tartans their 
largest advantage of the set. 
The Tartans would later lead 
by eight three more times 
before the ?nal set score of 
25–17 was in their favor.
After the Tartans fell 26–
24 in set four, they moved 
a 6–6 score in the ?fth set 
to a 9–6 advantage before 
winning 15–8, with the ?-
nal three points earned 
on kills by senior Eliza 
Donohue, sophomore Maia 
So-Holloway, and Donohue 
with the match point.
The Tartans hit their 
best in the ?fth set with 11 
kills and zero errors on 25 
attempts. Mueller ?nished 
with a match-high of 20 
kills, as Donohue and junior 
Sarah Jurgens each tallied 
14. Donohue ?nished the 
match with zero errors and 
a hitting percentage of .438. 
So-Holloway put down six 
kills on 12 attempts with 
zero errors along with 48 
assists and 24 digs for the 
match.
Sophomore Kayla Yew 
collected a career-best of 41 
digs with seven assists while 
Aqui led with ?ve block 
assists.
The Tartans then faced 
seventh-ranked Emory 
University in the semi?nals 
on the same day. The Eagles 
pulled out a 3–2 victory, 
knocking the Tartans’ record 
to 28–4 for the year.
The Tartans pressured 
the Eagles into 30 attack er-
rors for the match but only 
two came in the deciding 
?fth set when the Eagles hit 
a match-high .269 and won 
15–12.
Emory won the ?rst set 
25–18 before a battle for 
the second set went to the 
Tartans, 29–27. Emory then 
took a 2–1 lead with a 25–23 
win in set three before the 
Tartans answered with a 
25–23 win in set four.
Mueller led the team 
with 18 kills while Hurgens 
had 17 kills and Donohue 
had 12 kills. Donohue led 
the Tartans, who had 18 
block assists, with ?ve 
block assists as Mueller and 
Aqui each tallied four block 
assists.
So-Holloway collected 
37 assists and 27 digs while 
Yew had 40 digs.
On Saturday, the Tartans 
defeated no. 20 University 
of Chicago in the third-place 
match 3–1. With the win, 
the Tartans improve to 29–4 
overall while the Maroons 
are now 23–8.
Carnegie Mellon won the 
?rst two sets by the scores 
of 25–22 and 26–24 be-
fore Chicago took set three 
25–15. In the fourth set, in 
which the Tartans won 25–
16, the score was tied at 9–9 
before Carnegie Mellon took 
eight of the next nine points 
to grab a 17–10 lead and 
went on for the nine-point 
victory. During the stretch, 
So-Holloway recorded three 
of her four service aces.
The Tartans had two 
players with double-digit 
kills, as Jurgens and Mueller 
each tabbed 14. Jurgens hit 
.353 while Mueller hit .250. 
So-Holloway and senior 
Amanda Thiele totaled 38 
of the Tartans’ 48 assists. 
So-Holloway handed out 22 
and Thiele 16.
Yew continued her 
double-digit dig streak with 
17 digs, and her streak is 
now at 39 dating back to last 
season. Mueller recorded 13 
digs in the win. At the net, 
Jurgens and Aqui each had 
three block assists while 
Donohue tabbed two block 
solos and two block assists.
The Tartans ?nished the 
regular season tied with the 
most wins, 29, under 13-
year head coach Kim Kelly 
and will wait to see if they 
receive an at-large bid to 
the NCAA tournament on 
Monday, Nov. 6. The selec-

Men’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s soccer team closed the 
regular season on the road 
at Case Western Reserve 
University Saturday eve-
ning. Despite scoring ?rst 
for the 14th time this sea-
son, the Tartans fell 2–1 to 
the Spartans in UAA action. 
The Tartans close at 10–4–3 
and 2–3–2 in the UAA while 
the Spartans ?nish the year 
at 7–9–2 and 3–4.
Sophomore Elliot Cohen 
put the Tartans ahead in the 
16th minute when his shot 
from nearly 20 yards out hit 
the back of the net. Senior 
Ryan Stinebaugh earned the 
assist after crossing the ball 
from the right side across 
the pitch.
Case Western Reserve 
put in the equalizer in the 
76th minute off a goal from 
inside the 18-yard box.
Less than ?ve minutes lat-
er, another Spartan scored 
off a free kick from 25 yards 
out to give the home team 
the lead in the 81st minute.
Late in the 82nd minute, 
junior Zack Masciopinto 
put a shot on frame that the 
goalkeeper stopped. Boyle 
later stopped a shot by ju-
nior Anthony Gulli with two 
minutes and 15 seconds re-
maining in the game.
Gulli’s shot was the last of 
the game and the Spartans 
held on for the home win.
Women’s Soccer
Two goals by senior 
Sienna Stritter led the ninth-
ranked Carnegie Mellon 
University women’s soccer 
team to a 3–1 victory at Case 
Western Reserve University 
on Saturday evening. The 
Tartans ?nished the regular 
season with a 13–2–2 mark 
and 5–1–1 UAA record while 
the Spartans ?nish the year 
at 7–11 and 1–6.
Stritter put in the game’s 
?rst goal when her corner 
kick in the 27th minute 
curved over the keeper and 
in the far corner netting for 
her second score of the year.
Two minutes and 20 
seconds later, sophomore 
Emery Noll sent a free kick 
from 25 yards out on the left 
side of the ?eld to the far 
post. Her service sailed over 
the keeper, grazed the cross-
bar and bounced across the 
goal line for her ?rst tally of 
the season.
Stritter’s second goal of 
the game came in the 34th 
minute when she struck a 
shot from 26 yards in the 
center of the ?eld to the up-
per left corner. First-year 
Ashley Akin assisted on the 
play with a pass back to 
Stritter for the shot.
The Spartans broke up 
the shutout on a penalty kick

CMU FOOTBALL, from A10
A win against Case 
Western would likely qual-
ify the Tartans for a bowl 
game: an out of conference 
game at a neutral site. This 
would allow the team to 
play another game and get 
yet another win under their 
belt. Regardless of the long-
term bene?ts, beating Case 
Western is their focus, as 
pride in the rivalry would 
demand no less.
“The preparation will 
be there. The enthusiasm 
will be there. The excite-
ment will be there. It’s just 
a question of discipline and 
turnovers and ef?ciency. 
The team that outplays the 
other will win the game,” 
said Lackner.
WORLD SERIES, from A10
The publication had 
proclaimed that Houston 
would win the one year 
that their city needed it the 
most, and boy did the Astros 
need it most this year.
Nine weeks after 
Hurricane Harvey swept 
through Houston, dev-
astating everything from 
the streets to the people’s 
homes, the Astros have 
given the people something 
to cheer about, a welcome 
distraction from the trials 
of reality. This World Series 
and the Astros’ win are 
things that everyone, from 
Dodgers faithful to clueless 
fair-weather fans, can en-
joy. This is what sports are 
all about.

Pittsburgh Pirates decide on player contract optionsHouston Astros win World Series, earn ?rst ever title
BRAD PUSKAR
Junior Staffwriter
With the Pittsburgh 
Pirates recently announcing 
that they picked up out?eld-
er Andrew McCutchen’s 
2018 option and declined 
pitcher Wade LeBlanc’s and 
catcher Chris Stewart’s op-
tions, many people have 
begun speculating what the 
Bucs plan to accomplish in 
the offseason. Let’s break it 
down position by position.
Pirates pitching was up 
and down in the 2017 sea-
son, but it never seemed to 
be a consistent problem. 
The Bucs have a number 
of young, up-and-com-
ing pitchers like Trevor 
Williams, Steven Brault, 
Jameson Taillon, Chad 
Kuhl, and, if he can prove 
himself, Tyler Glasnow.
It’s likely that the Pirates 
will try and save money by 
sticking with their home-
grown group, but it’s not 
outside the realm of pos-
sibility that they make a 
move for a veteran pitcher 
like Michael Pineda. Pineda 
is coming off Tommy John 
surgery, so he may not 
be ready to throw in time 
for spring training, which 
may give Glasnow another 
chance to prove that he’s 
ready to throw in the major 
leagues.
Stewart’s option being 
declined leaves the job of 
catching up to Francisco 
Cervelli and Elias Diaz. 
With Cervelli’s constant 
injuries, Diaz saw a fair 
amount of playing time last 
season. Hopefully, the pair 
will split duties behind the 
dish more evenly, so as to 
relieve some of the strain on 
Cervelli.
The in?eld seems to be 
mostly locked down, with 
Josh Bell set to start at ?rst 
base, putting an end to a 
streak of one-season start-
ers at that position that 
stretched back to 2009. Josh 
Harrison and Jordy Mercer 
seem set to hold down the 
middle in?eld. The Pirates 
only big question mark sits 
at third base.
The Pirates have been 
holding on to hope for the 
return of Jung-Ho Kang, 
who didn’t play in the 2017 
season after being unable to 
secure a work visa in the US. 
David Freese, nominated 
for a Gold Glove at the hot 
corner, isn’t a bad replace-
ment, but at 34, Freese just 
can’t thrive as an everyday 
player. The Pirates need a 
power-hitting third base-
man to take the weight off 
Freese’s shoulders and get 
some power back into the 
otherwise weak hitting 
lineup.
One great grab would be 
Mike Moustakas. He’s com-
ing off of a 38-home run 
season with the Royals, so 
he’d ?t right in to comple-
ment the power of Bell and 
McCutchen. Moustakas is, 
however, slated to make 
a bit more than what the 
Pirates have ever offered, so 
it’s unrealistic that the Bucs 
grab him. Someone a little 
cheaper would be Todd 
Frazier. He’s got a solid 
glove and hit 27 home runs 
last year.
The Pirates’ out?eld 
seems to be locked and 
loaded as well, as long as 
McCutchen doesn’t get 
traded. The starting three 
have good support from the 
bench in players like Jordan 
Luplow, Sean Rodriguez, 
and Adam Frazier.
Some bullpen help 
will de?nitely be needed. 
Homegrown players like 
Edgar Santana and Dovydas 
Neverauskas seem to have 
more than earned their 
spots into the pen after per-
formances last year, but the 
Bucs need more depth than 
what they have now. Pat 
Neshek is up for free agency 
this year and could serve as 
a solid setup man for Felipe 
Rivero. Jake McGee, a lefty, 
could be another decent op-
tion to help out.

It’s Game 7 of the World 
Series, the bottom of the 
ninth with two outs. The 
batter swings on the ?rst 
pitch of the count, a ground-
ball to the right. With an 
easy pass to ?rst base to 
get the out, the Houston 
Astros beat the Los Angeles 
Dodgers and are World 
Champions for the ?rst time 
in their 56-year history.
The Fall Classic started 
slowly and quickly at the 
same time, a warmup, a 
tease to what was to come. 
A four-run doozy, Game 
1 lasted only two hours 
and 28 minutes, one of the 
shortest World Series games 
ever. Game 2, at the time, 
seemed like the pinnacle 
of what a championships 
series between the two 
best teams in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) could be. 
The 11-inning contest 
boasted eight home runs 
from eight different play-
ers, four from each team. 
Games 3 and 4 evened the 
series at two games apiece 
and continued both teams’ 
great hitting.
But Game 5 was the 
game that captivated the 
world, the game that told 
people who didn’t even 
watch baseball that they 
should be watching base-
ball. A 25-run, home run 
extravaganza spanning 10 
innings, Game 5 extended 
the excitement of Game 2. 
There were three three-run 
homers in two innings, and 
by the later innings, there 
was a constant feeling of 
“How can it get any better 
than this?” The game has 
been cited in the conversa-
tion of juiced balls and is 
already considered one of 
the best World Series games 
ever. After the insanity of 
Game 5, Game 6 brought 
the series back to earth, an-
other four-run game to the 
Dodgers.
With all the twists and 
turns of the series, the er-
rors and home runs, the wild 
pitches and endless calling 
to the bullpen, the relative 
mundaneness of Game 7 
should have been just what 
we expected, because of its 
unpredictability. After late-
inning game-tying runs and 
the loud whacks of the bat, 
it seems ?tting that base-
ball’s best offense got all ?ve 
of its game-winning runs in 
the ?rst two innings.
For the Astros, every-
one, from the team’s stars 
to the underrated signees, 
had their chance to help 
the team. World Series MVP 
George Springer opened 
the game with a double 
and capped off an amaz-
ing series with his ?fth 
homer of the series. The 
American League batting 
leader and probable MVP 
José Altuve drove in a run 
off a groundout. But in the 
end, for a team with two 
Cy Young Award pitchers, 
Dallas Keuchel and Justin 
Verlander, the winning 
pitcher was the journey-
man and oft-injured Charlie 
Morton, whose signing af-
ter last season raised some 
eyebrows. In his ?rst relief 
pitching since 2008, Morton 
smothered the Dodgers of-
fense for the ?nal four in-
nings in the biggest game of 
his career.
For the Dodgers, starting 
pitcher Yu Darvish laid his 
second egg of the series, not 
lasting the second inning 
and giving up all ?ve of the 
Astros’ runs. Ace Clayton 
Kershaw pitched for the 
last time in a Cy Young 
Award-worthy year for four 
scoreless innings in relief. 
The only candidate for NL 
Rookie of the Year, Cody 
Bellinger, who hit 39 home 
runs during the season, set 
the single postseason record 
for strikeouts with 29, 17 in 
the World Series, another 
record.
The Dodgers had many 
chances to climb out of the 
?ve-run hole they fell into 
in the second inning but left 
ten players on base. Never-
theless, the series should be 
less about how the Dodgers 
lost and more about how 
the Astros won. The teams 
could not be more differ-
ent. The Dodgers, with the 
highest payroll in the MLB, 
have a storied history with 
franchise Hall of Famers 
and multiple champion-
ships and won their divi-
sion this year for the ?fth 
straight time. In the last 
?ve years, the Astros have 
rocketed from the absolute 
bottom of the league to the 
top, winning only their sec-
ond pennant, and their ?rst 
championship.
As Morton retired the 
?nal three batters in the 
ninth inning, it almost 
seemed like destiny that 
the Astros would ful?ll that 
crazy Sports Illustrated pre-
diction from 2014.

“We treat every game like 
it’s the biggest game of the 
season,” said senior inside 
linebacker, mechanical 
engineering major, and co-
captain Stanley Bikulege.
As the Carnegie Mellon 
football team prepares for 
their last game of the sea-
son against Case Western 
Reserve University, they 
made no change in routine. 
Although it would be ex-
pected that the decade-long 
rivalry between the two 
schools for both football 
and academics would strike 
a bit of intimidation into the 
hearts of the Tartans, the 
team believed the game was 
on par with any other.
“We really do the same 
thing week in and week 
out. There’s an old expres-
sion about having faceless 
opponents and despite the 
fact that this is a team that 
we’re rivals with 
and although 
it would seem 
externally that 
this would carry 
extra weight, 
we’re [going to] 
go about our 
preparation the 
same way,” said 
senior running 
back, business 
administration 
major, and co-
captain Sam 
Benger.
Despite the 
team’s attempt to treat 
it as just another game, 
the game does hold more 
weight than usual. It will 
not only be the team’s last 
game of the regular season, 
but it could be their eighth 
win, a mark the Tartans 
have not accomplished 
since 2006.
“The fact that we haven’t 
won eight games during the 
regular season since 2006 
[is signi?cant]. You know, 
you’re always looking for 
motivation and reasons to 
win and that’s certainly 
a good reason to win this 
game. To have a winning 
percentage of 80 percent 
[is] something to strive for 
and just another reason 
to put forth our best ef-
fort,” said head coach Rich 
Lackner.
The game will have ef-
fects in both the Presidents’ 
Athletic Conference (PAC) 
and the University Athletic 
Association (UAA). In the 
PAC, Case Western current-
ly ties with Washington & 
Jefferson for the lead while 
in the UAA, the game’s win-
ner will take the title.
Among the many tal-
ented athletes who might 
make the difference for the 
Tartans, Benger stands as 
the most imposing ?gure for 
opposing defenses to face. 
Benger is the program’s 
all-time leading rusher, as 
he has run for 5,197 yards 
in 41 career games. Benger 
currently leads the team in 
rushing and ranks ?fth in 
the PAC and tops the UAA 
with 864 yards on 140 car-
ries for an average of 6.2 
yards per touch. He has 
rushed for 58 touchdowns 
and has six receiving scores 
for 64 touchdowns in his ca-
reer. Benger needs one more 
rushing score to become the 
school’s all-time leader. His 
yardage, along with his 58 
rushing touchdowns and 
865 carries, rank third on 
the PAC all-time list.
The game, which is to 
take place on Saturday, Nov. 
11th at 2 p.m., will not only 
be played on the Tartans’ 
home turf, but is also the 
32nd annual Academic 
Bowl and takes place dur-
ing homecoming week and 
the 50th Anniversary. This, 
along with the fact that the 
preceding weekend did not 
have a game and allowed 
players to rest, gives the 
team an advantage.
“I don’t know if I’d call 
it a pressure but [instead] 
a better atmosphere: it gets 
more people here, it makes 
the game more exciting 
for us to play in. And hav-
ing this week off really gets 
guys ready to get on the 
?eld again,” said Bikulege.

Special to The Tartan
On Nov. 11 two rivals 
will do battle in Pittsburgh 
as Case Western Reserve 
University (CWRU) and 
Carnegie Mellon University 
football teams will play in 
the 32nd annual Academic 
Bowl. Though the classic 
rivalry means quite a bit to 
both teams, the result will 
have extra implications for 
the Spartans as they are 
looking to return to the 
NCAA playoffs for the ?rst 
time since 2009.
CWRU opened the sea-
son with eight straight vic-
tories and have dominated 
opponents, winning each 
game by an average of 28.5 
points. Though CMU will 
be just the second team the 
Spartans play with a win-
ning record this season, 
CWRU will still come out on 
top and bring the Academic 
Bowl back to Cleveland af-
ter losing the previous two 
seasons.
Leading the Spartans’ of-
fensive attack are a pair of 
fourth-year players who are 
at their peaks.
Running back Jacob 
Burke averages over 100 
yards per game and has to-
taled 16 touchdowns on the 
ground this season. Gaining 
an average of ?ve yards per 
carrying, the bruising back 
is dif?cult for any defender 
to bring down.
Dual-threat quarterback 
Rob Cuda is behind center 
for his third and possibly 
best year as the starter. He 
has his highest completion 
percentage (61.8 percent), 
second most yards per game 
(259.9) and 
a 26 to ?ve 
touchdown 
to intercep-
tion ratio. 
Eleven differ-
ent receivers 
have caught 
a touchdown 
pass this sea-
son, so it’s not 
as simple as 
taking away 
Cuda’s prima-
ry weapon. 
And while 
Cuda hasn’t 
carried the ball 
a lot this season 
— just 71 rushing 
attempts in nine games 
— he possesses the ability to 
take off and run on any play.
CMU will have to choose 
which one of the two play-
makers to stop. And even 
if they can take away a 
Spartans’ weapon, CWRU’s 
other top performer will 
just step in and carry the 
load.
On the other side, the 
strength of the CMU offense 
used to be, and probably still 
is, fourth-year running back 
Sam Benger. He has totaled 
58 rushing touchdowns 
and over 5,000 rushing 
yards in his historic career 
as a Tartan. However, this 
season, opposing defenses 
have been able to shut him 
down. Just two times this 
season has Benger eclipsed 
100 yards on the ground.
It doesn’t get any easier 
for him as the Spartans 
defense is one of the best 
in the country at stopping 
the run. The team ranks 
37th in Division III with 
just 99.8 yards allowed per 
game on the ground. This 
includes holding Geneva 
College running back 
Trewon Marshall, who has 
the fourth-most rushing 
yards in Division III, to just 
56 yards on the ground. 
The whole unit is playing at 
its peak right now, forcing 
11 turnovers in the past two 
games.
For CWRU the matchup 
against the Tartans is a per-
fect revenge game. CMU 
ruined the team’s perfect 
season and the chance at 
making the playoffs last 
season. The team would 
want nothing more than to 
beat the Tartans to ?nish 
the job this year.
If there’s one factor that 
will push the Spartans over 
the top, it’s their desire for 
revenge over an archrival, 
especially one that has al-
ready denied the team the 
Academic Bowl for two 
straight years. CWRU wins 
this game.

On failing not making you a failure
Hey Ruth,
So, the inevitable happened. I’m officially pretty 
sure that I’m going to fail a class, and I have no 
clue what to do about it. It isn’t one of my core 
degree classes, but I was planning on using it as 
one of the electives that I need to graduate and I 
don’t want to have to re-take it.
Theoretically, I could still do reasonably well — but 
I’d need to get 100 percent on all the projects and 
exams left. I’m not even going to pretend that’s 
possible. If it was I wouldn’t be in this position in 
the first place!
I’m obviously bummed because this was 
absolutely nowhere in my plan, but I’m also kind 
of... ashamed? I was a great student all through 
high school and I didn’t come to Carnegie Mellon 
expecting it to be easy, but I still thought I’d be 
smart enough to pass all my classes. What do I 
even do about this?
Help,
F*** All, I’m Losing It, Not Good
Dear FAILING,
Since this won’t be published until the drop date, 
let’s assume that you haven’t and won’t be able 
to drop the class. Maybe you’re a senior with no 
time to re-take it, maybe you thought everything 
was going well until you bombed a big test too 
close to properly consider dropping, or maybe 
you can’t drop without unexpectedly going part-
time. The good news is that there are definitely still 
options available to you.
I’m also going to presume that you’ve been going 
to as many lectures and recitations as you can and 
have been doing all the work. If you haven’t... 
maybe consider that as a reason for why you 
aren’t doing that well? If for some reason you are 
incapable of engaging with the class on the level 
expected of you, go talk to the Office of Disability 
Resources as soon as you can. They might not be 
able to do much for you this late in the semester, 
but you’ve likely got at least one semester left, so 
it’d be a good idea to familiarize yourself.
Now that you’ve done all that — go talk to your 
professor. There is literally no downside. (Well, 
okay, you’ll have to work up the courage to do 
so, but I believe in you.) The worst thing that 
happens is that they can’t change anything and 
you’re in the same situation as before. The best 
thing that happens is that they offer you an extra 
credit assignment to bump you back up into 
passing territory. You won’t know until you give it 
a try.
At the same time, you should probably have a 
chat with your academic advisor so the two of 
you can talk through your options. As great as 
my advice is, counseling students through this kind 
of thing is their actual job, so they’re likely to be 
much more useful.
If worst comes to worst and you’re still in and 
failing this class by the last week of classes you 
should seriously consider withdrawing. I know 
you don’t want to re-take the class, but if you fail 
you’re going to have to anyways, and a “W” 
looks a lot better on a transcript than a straight up 
fail. There’s a reason the withdraw option exists, 
and it’s because people use it. Taking a “W” is 
not a mark of shame.
Speaking of — there’s nothing shameful about 
not doing well in a class. I know it’s hard to 
believe, and I’d be lying if I said I was 100 
percent okay with failing myself, but it doesn’t 
make you a disgrace. Sometimes life gets in the 
way, or you have difficulty following lecture, or 
you simply don’t get the material. It doesn’t make 
you any less worthwhile. You’re still a person 
who contributes to the world. Who cares if you 
had a rough patch or made a mistake? So has 
everyone else.
You can do this,

Apeksha Atal | Pillbox EditorBar Buddies: Fuel and Fuddle
I’ve never been a huge fan of beer, but I’m 
friends with a lot of people that are. It’s one 
of those drinks that you sort of have to grow 
into and understand the nuances of to truly 
appreciate. I remember going to the Heineken 
factory in Amsterdam, years ago, but because 
I was underaged I spent the whole time largely 
disconnected from what was happening and 
drinking Coca-Cola. Now that I’m of age, I’m 
more than open to having a life-changing beer 
experience, and last Wednesday night came close.
A friend of mine is a huge fan of Great 
Lakes Brewing Company, a Cleveland-based 
establishment that releases a delightful Christmas 
Ale during the Holiday season. Naturally, the day 
after Halloween was when it was released at Fuel 
and Fuddle this year, and the lot of us flocked on 
over for late night ale and warm, half-priced food.
The location: For those who haven’t heard of 
this glorious establishment, Fuel and Fuddle is 
located in Oakland, just off of Forbes Ave, and 
usually has people lined up outside, hungry to go 
in. It’s a walkable distance from campus and right 
in the center of what I can only think to call the 
“Oakland nightlife scene.” Take any of the 61s 
from campus if you’re feeling a little lazy.
The drinks: Admittedly, this was actually my first 
time drinking at Fuel, and I pretty much just drank 
the ale, but I will say that it was more delightful 
than anticipated. It was a little hoppy, but it also 
had some essence of the holiday spirit that I’m still 
having trouble describing. It didn’t taste bad after 
I’d eaten some food, and it didn’t taste bad when 
I drank it alone. Maybe it was something about 
being with friends. Maybe it was the magic of 
being almost two months before Christmas.
The vibe: Fuel is always lovely. The menu is full of 
items to satisfy your cravings, from the “Smashed 
Potato Pizza” to the baked brie. Fuel also boasts a 
couple screens, so if you’re interested in catching 
a game, this is a great place to hang out. There’s 
plenty of room to sit down and the reddish-yellow 
glow that fills the room brings in a sense of 
warmth that is even more desirable in the fall and 
winter time.
Going as a group is ideal because you can 
maximize the assortment of food and drink you 
have to sample. I shared food with a friend, 
clinked glasses, and had more than enough laughs 
to leave my belly hurting.
Lit or Nah: You can go pretty late, enjoy a drink or 
food, and get those warm fuzzies that everyone 
needs every now and then. For these reasons, 
I’m going to go with Lit. Fuel and Fuddle has 
become synonymous with “late night” and my 
go-to response to any “I’m hungry”s past 11 p.m. 
I’d recommend trying the ale while they still have 
it and grabbing some grub with someone you 
need to catch up with. Trust me, your tummy will 
thank you.
Kicking off the Christmas season

The last time I remember having real fried chicken was one night back in August when my 
mom made some for dinner. I’ve always loved my mom’s fried chicken, and what I love 
most about it is the bread crumb coating on the outside. She seasons the bread crumb mix-
ture to perfection before frying, and the result is a delicious and extra crispy crust on the 
chicken. I’ve always felt that no other version of fried chicken can compare to my mom’s, 
so I’ve never even bothered to buy fried chicken during my time in college. It wasn’t until 
my friend brought me to Chick’n Bubbly that I began to reconsider my decisions.
Chick’n Bubbly is a small eatery in Oakland that is known for its Korean-styled fried chick-
en and bubble tea. Customers are able to buy a combination of drumsticks and wings in 
snack, small, medium, and large sizes. All chicken is served with a choice of sauce: sweet 
and spicy sauce, soy garlic sauce, or spicy soy garlic sauce. What’s more, Chick’n Bubbly 
even offers gloves for eating their chicken, since it can get messy very easily.
When I went to Chick’n Bubbly for the first time a few days ago, I was surprised to see 
how small the place was. The small space did seem to create a very comfortably social 
environment, where even employees were having casual conversations with the customers. 
I admired the urban setup of the restaurant, along with its social atmosphere, and I knew I 
wanted to come back another time to hang out with more of my friends.
Both of our orders of chicken came after about fifteen minutes. We got a medium sized 
box of chicken with half covered in sweet and spicy sauce, and the other half covered in 
soy garlic sauce. Although the price of the meal was a bit expensive, the food was defi-
nitely worth it. Eating did get very messy pretty quickly, but at least the gloves were helpful 
for keeping my hands clean. The thick coating of the sauces (which got all over my face) 
added lots of flavor and spice to the whole eating experience: the sweet and spicy sauce 
provided a good combination of flavoring. The sweet taste did overpower the spice at first, 
however at the end the spiciness kicked in, leaving a bit of a burning sensation on my lips. 
The soy garlic sauce was also a little sweet, but the garlic flavor complemented it well. The 
combination of all these flavors, the texture of the sesame seeds sprinkled on top of the 
chicken, and the delicious crunchiness of the outer crust made the entire food experience 
amazing.
The chicken at Chick’n Bubbly is definitely unlike any other version of fried chicken I’ve 
eaten, although it still doesn’t compare to my mom’s recipe (but it’s close, not going to lie). 
The food there is fun to eat and surely tasty, just don’t forget to wear the gloves. If you’re 
thinking about sharing some fried chicken with a couple of friends in the near future, be 
sure to check out Chick’n Bubbly! art by Paola Mathus | Art Editor

The Queen of Versailles, directed by documen-
tary photographer Lauren Greenfield, was not 
what I expected. Lauren Greenfield may be more 
publicly known from her commercial work, the 
“#LikeAGirl” ads for the feminine hygiene brand 
Always. Her personal projects include a photo 
book at an inpatient center for eating disorders, 
a series on money and youth in L.A., and photo 
series about girls in culture.
The Queen of Versailles is a documentary 
about American wealth. It set out to follow 
the family of David Siegel, the CEO of 
Westgate Resorts, as they began to build 
themselves a literal American palace, mod-
eled after Versailles. But their $100 million 
dream home was not yet finished when the 
2008 market crash hit — and the film follows 
Jackie and David’s Siegel’s life from then on.
The beginning of the movie, where David 
Siegel holds Miss America parties and flirts 
with 20-year-old contestants, and Jackie lives 
the life of a wealthy socialite, sets up an 
expectation for something much more shal-
low. Donald Trump, jarringly, pops up 
several times in relation to the family. 
Siegel is shown photographed with 
the Bushes and conservative elites. 
What I expected was an hour and 
a half on a family who lived in their 
shallow, white conservative bubble of 
outrageous wealth and spending.
What Greenfield crafted, however, 
was a beautiful and vulnerable paral-
lel of this family’s troubles and rela-
tionships with a universal story of 
financial security in America. Jackie 
talks also about how she and her 
husband had eight kids and estab-
lished a lavish lifestyle because they 
expected security of income. The 
slow chaos and decay of families’ 
expected quality of life work as an 
observation of our current concep-
tion of the American dream.
With interviews of their nannies who struggle 
to support families on work visas and Jackie’s 
friends from her small hometown, Greenfield is 
able to paint a picture of a community of people 
at different levels of society just trying to make 
it in the world. David Siegel talks about how the 
dream 
is to 
be able to give your kids a better life than what 
you have. It’s clear in his apparent inability to be 
happy with his family, buried in documents try-
ing to find money to save what he built, that the 
film is about how all of these families struggles so 
hard to keep that dream alive once the financial 
crisis hit.
Since the movie’s release in 2012, a lot has 
changed. Presumably, Greenfield’s references 
to Donald Trump and his golden tower were not 
made with prescient knowledge of his presiden-
cy, but The Queen of Versailles is an important 
film to look back on to understand how we have 
gotten to where we are. 
Greenfield, in these complicated vignettes of 
life, has created a portrait of a family that we 
can see ourselves in. Siegel’s efforts to focus on 
their family and relearn the things that matter, 
even as David Siegel prepares to push towards 
bankruptcy to save his company and his palace, 
is what makes this film so engaging and tragic. 
I left with great affection for Jackie, a woman 
who is self-made in her own right — who worked 
to get a degree in engineering, a modeling 
career, and freedom from an abusive 
marriage — who loves her family so 
much, and despite her cluelessness 
wants to make something meaningful 
and better out of her life.
Understanding the powerful and who 
we are taught to aspire to become — 
these wealthy elites — is important in 
also understanding our nation’s frustra-
tions. Moreover, this film gave space 
to recognize how difficult it was for 
everyone to recover from the 2008 
financial crisis. Perhaps, we have 
not fully honored the adversity and 
the resilience that followed how 
helpless everyone was to bankers, 
the economy, and stock markets, 
and that, perhaps, we all have 
more struggles in common than 
we think.

AcaPittsburgh
6
A decade of good times and good causes
This past Friday, crowds filled McConomy 
Auditorium for the annual AcaPittsburgh ben-
efit concert. The charity event was started 
in 2008 by Counterpoint, one of Carnegie 
Mellon University’s all-female a cappella 
groups, and this year the proceeds from 
AcaPittsburgh ticket and merchandise sales 
went to People to People, an organization 
that helps provide music education to those in 
developing countries.
With all eight Carnegie Mellon’s a cappella 
groups in attendance, the auditorium quickly 
reached maximum capacity as everyone 
eagerly awaited the start of the concert. Even 
from the beginning, the crowd was excited for 
the show, cheering loudly and calling out their 
friends’ names as Counterpoint took the stage 
for their first song.
After Counterpoint welcomed everyone to 
their show, the MC introduced Joyful Noise, 
Carnegie Mellon’s Christian a cappella group. 
The lead male and female vocalist for the first 
song performed a heart-wrenching mash-up 
of A Great Big World’s “Say Something” and 
Jason Mraz’s “I Won’t Give Up.” I would 
never have thought to pair the two songs, 
but the contrast between the lyrics made the 
already poignant songs even more emotional. 
Although the songs really complemented each 
other, the leads’ voices did not. Though they 
were both clearly talented singers, their har-
monizing fell a bit short for me. Despite this, 
the group continued strong with a stunningly 
beautiful and powerful rendition of Alicia Keys’ 
“If I Ain’t Got You” and closed with Amanda 
Cook’s “You Don’t Miss a Thing.”
Next, Saans, Carnegie Mellon’s all-female 
South Asian a cappella group, took the stage. 
Right from the start, Saans brought high 
energy and a fantastic fusion of Western and 
South Asian music styles, opening with Charlie 
Puth’s “We Don’t Talk Anymore.” Their second 
performance was Justin Bieber’s “As Long 
As You Love Me,” which included incredible 
beatboxing and rapping throughout. After the 
first two fantastic performances, I didn’t think 
the group could do any better than it already 
was, but their arrangement of Sia’s “Cheap 
Thrills” was definitely thrilling. “Cheap Thrills” 
and “Kamli,” a Hindi song from the 2013 
movie Dhoom 3, blended surprisingly perfectly 
together, and it was one of my favorite perfor-
mances of AcaPitt.
After Saans came Soundbytes, and if the 
crowd wasn’t excited enough before, 
Soundbytes’ fans deafened with their continu-
ous cheers. These cheers did not go unwar-
ranted. Although I was not familiar with the 
first two songs they performed, Emily King’s 
“Down” and Allen Stone’s “Bed I Made,” 
the group’s sheer talent shined through and I 
enjoyed every moment of their time on stage. 
Soundbytes saved the best for last as well, as 
my favorite of their set had to be their final, 
masterful performance of Bishop Briggs’ “Like 
a River.”
The last a cappella group of the first half of 
the show was The Originals. Performing the 
second Puth song of the night, the all-male a 
cappella group captured the audience with 
“Attention.” After that, they took a risk that 
paid off with Lorde’s “Sober,” expertly execut-
ing the arrangement and making the song 
their own. The Originals only continued to 
gain momentum throughout their set, awing me 
even more with each new performance. Their

last song, Chance the Rapper’s “Same Drugs,” 
was an especially soulful and sincere perfor-
mance that blew me away.
Kicking off the second half of AcaPittsburgh, 
the Treblemakers started off with a skillful exe-
cution of Ella Eyre’s “If I Go.” After, the group 
performed one of my favorite songs, James 
Bay’s “Hold Back the River.” I may be biased, 
but the Treblemakers’ rendition of the song 
was an incredible arrangement, and the vocals 
were just as fantastic. The Treblemakers fin-
ished with MisterWives’ “Machine,” continuing 
to exhibit their musical prowess with not only a 
phenomenal lead, but also formidable backup 
and vocal percussion performances.
Then C# took the stage with a fun mash-up 
of Maroon 5’s “Sugar” and Katy Perry’s 
“Birthday.” Although a bit too bubbly and 
sweet for my taste, the group was clearly hav-
ing a good time, bringing great energy to 
the stage, and also to display their talents in 
the vocal percussion department. After a per-
formance of “Ri But Luo” by Jolin Tsai, they 
closed with a great mashup of Ariana Grande 
songs, including “Dangerous Woman” and 
“Leave Me Lonely.”
Second to last was Deewane, Carnegie 
Mellon’s male South Asian a cappella group. 
Despite only performing two songs, Deewane 
did not fail to impress with their incredible 
fusion arrangements of South Asian music, 
delivering passionate performances of Sam 
Smith’s “Lay Me Down” and Jon Bellion’s “All 
Time Low.” They knew how to leave thier audi-
ence wanting more.
Last, the show returned to its host group, 
Counterpoint. Their performance of Ariana 
Grande’s “Side to Side” was well done, but a 
bit low-energy, with the group doing not much 
else other than singing and swaying in place 
for most of the song. However, they cranked 
up the energy with their final song, “Everytime 
We Touch” by Cascada. The upbeat nature of 
the song did the best at showing the group’s 
talent, especially when the beat dropped and 
the amazing percussion and beatbox took 
center stage.
Overall, AcaPittsburgh was a success. The 
audience reacted positively and excitedly to 
each performance, and every group displayed 
incredible talents in the a cappella realm 
while also remaining true to their unique roots 
and styles.

Thor:Ragnarok
Izzy Sio | Assistant Pillbox Editor
art by Apeksha Atal | Pillbox Editor
In Norse mythology, Ragnarok is a highly import-
ant event that essentially results in the end of the 
world as we know it. There are countless  
natural disasters, there is a huge battle that results 
in the death of some beloved Norse gods, and it is  
ultimately inevitable. However, afterward the world 
is born anew and recreated.
Marvel Studios’ Thor: Ragnarok, directed by Taika Waititi, is appropriately titled 
because it does just that on several levels — for the character of Thor, for the 
Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and for the audience dying of laughter, to 
name a few. It is probably the most fun I’ve had while watching a Marvel movie, 
and still surprisingly managed to tell a powerful story about family, identity, and 
one’s place in the world while remaining a unique entry in the MCU, 17 movies in.
The movie lets the audience know of its expectations and lighthearted demeanor 
off the bat by opening with Thor, in chains, facing off against the fire demon 
Surtur in an exchange of witty banter, a first for the initially empty-headed God 
of Thunder. Letting Surtur, the catalyst of the prophesied Ragnarok, know that he 
couldn’t care less of his ramblings on his inevitable plans for destroying the world, 
Thor takes his sweet time to listen to Surtur’s big evil speech as the chains he dan-
gles from cause him to rotate ever so slowly before freeing himself with the help of 
Mjolnir and kicking the movie off with a bang with an intense and vibrant massacre 
of Surtur’s minions. 
This opening sequence of events is a great summary of how well Waititi revitalizes the 
Thor franchise. In a film series that is known for being truly tertiary to the larger plans of 
the MCU, the What We Do In The Shadows director plants down his feet and, ironically, 
demands the Thor franchise to be taken seriously in its latest installment. Waititi truly makes 
the film his own through reinventing the series’ genre, not holding back on the humor that 
he and the actors incorporate, and giving the film a carefree air amid the impending doom 
of the film. Waititi continues to expand a distinct and colorful style that the MCU has begun to 
experiment with yet still operates within what he is given to create his own color palette for Thor: 
Ragnarok, tapping into the beauty of Asgard that was previously poorly showcased in previous 
Thor installments.
Most notably, Waititi reinvents Thor as a character, with the aid of star Chris Hemsworth in one of his best 
performances yet. Not only is Thor an entertaining, hilarious character, but in Thor: Ragnarok, Hemsworth 
helps to flesh out Thor into a three-dimensional character and makes the God of Thunder incredibly 

---------------------------------------------------

human. Hemsworth gives Thor’s struggles a personal edge 
through his quest to find his own inner power, his identity, 
and his place among Earth and Asgard, making his journey 
refreshing and incredibly satisfying. 
 
Other standout characters include Tom Hiddleston’s Loki, 
stealing hearts with his tortured bad-boy charm since 2011, 
and Jeff Goldblum being Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster. 
Additionally, Hela was one of the most entertaining and ter-
rifying villains I had seen in a movie for a long time. 
Cate Blanchett incorporated the perfect balance of 
deadpan humor, pure fear, and raw power into her 
portrayal as the Goddess of Death, demanding to be 
noticed and known throughout all of Asgard. Often she’d 
help to break up huge, tense, dramatic moments with her own 
humor, which surprisingly suits Blanchett really well. She had 
no shame or moral boundaries keeping her from slaughtering 
an entire army of Asgard with a wicked smile on her face, 
which made me love her even more.
However, everything about Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie was 
flawless. Her introduction enraptured audiences immediately 
and her presence as a mighty warrior and overall bada** 
was felt in every scene she was in. Like Hemsworth, Thompson 
did an amazing job of humanizing Valkyrie’s struggles to the 
audience, fleshing her out through the entire movie and 
truly making Valkyrie come alive. While Valkyrie was pretty much a 
god, Thompson made her feel so real and organic, easily making her 
the breakout star of the movie.
What made Thor: Ragnarok an amazing cinematic experience 
was busting your guts out with the audience while reveling 
in the complex and well-executed interconnected nature 
of the MCU and of Waititi’s direction. Not only does 
Waititi tie in classic Marvel moments perfectly into 
this story, he also pays homage to the old and 
new of the MCU in general. He makes it incredibly 
accessible for all Marvel fans, and his love of Marvel, 
his love of filmmaking, and his love for his movie shine 
as brightly and vividly as Thor: Ragnarok’s color scheme. 
While the movie is not technically perfect, it is by far the most 
enjoyable experience in the theater I’ve had this year and one 
I’d revisit over and over.
