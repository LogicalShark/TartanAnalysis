Student Gov’t President resigns
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Assistant News Editor .
At last Tuesday’s Student Sen­
ate meeting, Student Govern­
ment President Natalie Ges- 
mond, who was impeached on 
March 11 for alleged lack of duty 
performance and violation of the 
Bylaws of the Student Body, re­
signed from her position in a let­
ter read by Public Relations Chair 
Jim Albert. According to
Tartan File Photo
Natalie Gesmond, former Student Govern­
ment President, announced her resignation 
at last Tuesday’s Senate meeting.
Gesmond, she resigned because 
she did not want to become fur­
ther involved with “the pettiness 
and irresponsible actions of Stu­
dent Senate” and not because of 
her impeachment.
In her letter, Gesmond said, “I 
am not resigning to flee from Stu­
dent Senate or because I am afraid 
of getting ousted. I am resigning 
because I am completely disap­
pointed with Senate, and I do not 
want to be a part of their un­
productiveness andim- 
maturity.”
Gesmond’s letter to 
Student Senate and the 
campus community ex­
plains her reasons for 
resigning as Student 
GovemmentPresident 
by giving her opinions 
on the impeachment 
process, the meetings 
of Student Senate, and 
the actions ofthe chair. 
“The letter specifically 
states the actions ofthe 
chair. Of course, he’ll 
respond and object,” 
she said. “It said a lot of 
things that people have 
been dying to hear.” 
“There were a num­
ber of things that both-
ered me about her [resignation] ernment President is required to
letter,” said Chair of Student Sen­
ate Greg Haverkamp, who pro­
posed her impeachment at the 
March 11 meeting. “She has, not 
been to a Student Senate meet­
ing in at least a semester,” 
Haverkamp said. “For her to say 
what Senate is like is absurd. 
Senate has changed a tremen­
dous deal.”
“/ am resigning because I am 
completely disappointed with 
Senate
— Natalie Gesmond
Haverkamp also said that 
Gesmond was elected to fulfill 
the duties of Student Government 
President as outlined in, at that 
time, the Constitution of the Stu­
dent Body. “[Gesmond] just 
stopped coming to Senate meet­
ings,” Haverkamp said. “How can 
StudentSenate andStudent Gov­
ernment work together when the 
executive wasn’t doing the duty 
of Student Government Presi­
dent?”
According to the Bylaws of the 
Student Body, the Student Gov-
attend Student Senate and Fac­
ulty Senate meetings. The Presi­
dent should also be in attendance 
at President’s Student Advisory 
Council (PSAC) and University 
Student Affairs Committee 
(USAC) meetings. Gesmond said 
in her letter, “I will be the first to 
admit that I was unable to com­
pletely fulfill the obligation to 
attend all 
meetings 
and have 
office 
hours 
weekly.... I 
was either 
in the hos- 
pital or re­
cuperating from a bout with my 
illness. I believe this is an excuse 
for my absence.”
Haverkamp said that if 
Gesmond knew she would not be 
able to attend meetings, she 
should have resigned before. “She 
needs to stay on campus and push, 
push, push,” he said.
Gesmond said that Senators 
intended touse her impeachment 
in order to reassert a seldom- 
used power of Senate. She also 
said that such assertion was done

Police formalize walking escort
Fear of rapes bring media
By KENDRICK K. CHUA
Tartan News Ejditor
As the result of increased 
media attention due to the sec­
ond rape of a CMU student on 
Frew Street this semester, 
Campus Police have instituted 
a regular walking escort. Plan­
ning additional meetings with 
students and student organi­
zations, Campus Police have 
also publicized existing secu­
rity programs in a letter to the 
campus community.
Effective last Monday, one 
Campus Police officer has been 
specifically assigned to answer 
student requests for a walking 
escort on campus, from 8 pm 
until 2 am every night. Accord­
ing to Campus Police, officers 
have always answered requests 
for walking escorts, even be­
fore the program was formal­
ized. No additional officers have 
been hired. This program is in­
dependent from the SafeWalk 
program, which involves stu­
dent volunteers and has not yet 
been implemented.
Campus Police Chief James 
LaPaglia appeared before Stu­
dent Senate on Tuesday to 
present the letter, which de­
tailed plans to repair and add 
lighting on Frew Street and the 
existing policy of open parking 
lots in the early mornings, as 
well as the walking escort. Ac­
cording to LaPaglia, this was 
the first step in a larger plan to 
“get more input from students.”
CMU President Robert 
Mehrabian said that the two 
rapes this semester were a 
“rude awakening.” Said Meh­
rabian, “Anytime an incident 
like this happens ... I am in­
formed almostimmediately [by 
LaPaglia.] I almost dread hear­
ing the phone ring in the middle 
of the night because I know 
something serious has hap­
pened.” Mehrabian had two 
senior vice presidents walk the 
area from Frew Street to Tech

CMU, Pitt students march downtown against rape
By STEPH STINE
Tartan Staffwriter
On Friday, April 2, Pittsburgh resi­
dents joined together in a Take Back 
the Night March through Downtown 
Pittsburgh. This march and the ensu­
ing program in the City Council Cham­
bers protested the “unspoken curfew 
on women,” according to flyers and 
other publicity. Additionally, it served 
as a symbol for survivors of every form 
of sexual assault.
The march was co-sponsored by the 
University of Pittsburgh Women’s Or­
ganization and Pittsburgh Action 
Against Rape (PAAR).
Just after dark, participants in the 
march gathered in front of the Federal 
Building. Barbara Weiner’s rallying 
speech emphasized the common goal 
of the marchers. “We want to say 'no’ 
to the national curfew on women, chil­
dren, and other minorities.... We want 
to make our own light. We want to 
take back the night!” Weiner said. “We 
need to put a permanent curfew on 
those who should stay home... rapists, 
child molesters, and those who prey on 
us.” Weiner is a member of PAAR who 
was instrumental in organizing the 
Take Back the Night event.
Throughout the march, participants 
joined in chants as they passed through 
streets lined by passers-by and 
storeowners. “People unite! Take back 
the night!” and “Stop the hate! No 
more rape!” they cheered. Despite the 
rainy weather conditions, more than 
300 persons participated in the march.
The program which followed the 
march gave survivors of sexual as­
sault a chance to speak about their 
personal experiences. As Weiner said, 
“I believe in strengthening the voice of 
survivors and giving them a platform 
to heal.” That was exactly what the 
program enabled the speakers to do.
One survivor, identified only as 
Sally, emphasized during her talk, 
“Taking back the night to me means 
taking back my life.” March partici­
pants reacted to this statement with 
an overwhelming round of applause 
and a supportive standing ovation.
Also during the program, Stella 
Gresham, the associate director of the 
World Life Institute, brought to light 
the war crimes she witnessed only 
weeks ago in Bosnia. Many of these 
crimes, she pointed out, are sexual 
assaults, and their survivors are not 
limited to women.
Gresham encouraged the march 
participants to “take back tonight, then 
take back one night next week, and 
another night the week after that. 
Don’t stop until you’ve taken back all 
nights!” Again, enthusiastic listeners 
cheered in approval of this goal.
Christy Trautman, a co-organizer of 
the march, spoke of the fortunate ap­
propriateness ofthe program’s indoor 
setting. Originally planned to be held 
in Market Square, the program was 
moved indoors due to the inclimate 
weather. Trautman remarked that 
many people perceive sexual violence 
as something which occurs only out-

Former University President Cyert recovering from surgery for cancer
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan Staffwriter
Former University President Dr. Ri­
chard M. Cyert is recovering at home 
after surgery at Montefiore Hospital to 
remove a portion of his liver affected by 
cancer. Cyert had been receiving chemo­
therapy treatments since being diag­
nosed with cancer last year. He is ex­
pected to recover fully. Cyert is cur­
rently a GSIA professor of economics 
and management.
Former University President Richard Cyert.
“My understanding is that his recov­
ery will take a while,” said Don Hale, 
University vice president for public re­
lations. Hale added that he had not 
heard from Cyert and did not know when 
Cyert planned to return.
Cyert was president of the University 
from 1972 until 1991, when he resigned 
to take over the presidency of the 
Camegie-Bosch Institute (CBI) for Ap­
plied Studies in International Manage­
ment at GSIA. He ended his affiliation 
with CBI last year.
Ludwig F. Schafer, author 
of Evolution of a National 
Research University, 1965- 
1990: the Stever Administra­
tion and Cyert Years at 
Carnegie Mellon, has called 
him “unquestionably the guid­
ing spirit thatledthe [Univer­
sity] to its current distinction.” 
Schafer credits Cyert with a 
number of major policy initia­
tives, including the develop­
ment of Andrew, the improve­
ment of research, strengthing 
of undergraduate education, 
and the growth of the Uni­
versity’s stature in the re­
gional economy and interna­
tionally.
Cyert has been widely 
praisedbysome and criticized 
by others for his role in bring­
ing more corporate research 
funding to CMU.
Natalie Taaffe, associate 
dean of external affairs at 
GSIA, said that Cyert’s ten­
ure at CMU has been remark­
Tartan Rie Photo
able. “Ho has spent his entire academic 
career at Carnegio Mellon. Ho wont from 
being an instructor to being dean of 
GSIA to becoming president of the Uni­
versity. Then at his ‘retirement,’ he 
headed the Camegie-Bosch Institute.
“I doubt if anyone’s ever accomplished 
this. He’s probably the only one in the 
world who’s ever done this.”
Taaffe said that the University ex­
pects Cyert to return in a few months 
after his recuperation is complete. “He is 
very fondly remembered by the alumni,” 
she said, and added that many former 
students will be returning for the dedi­
cation of the GSIA building this month. 
“We hope very much that he will be here 
for that.”
Dr. Cyert is the author or co-author of 
more than 10 books, one of which, A 
Behaviorial Theory of the Firm, was 
named a Citation Classic by the Insti­
tute for Scientific Information in honor 
of its being cited more than 1,000 times 
by other writers.
He has received honorary doctorates 
from many institutions in the United 
States and Europe, and is a fellow of the 
Econometric Society, the American So­
ciety for the Advancement of Science, 
and the American Statistical Associa­
tion.
Cyert received his BA from the Uni­
versity of Minnesota and his PhD from 
Columbia University in New York City. 
In 1948 he joined Carnegie Tech’s fac­
ulty as an instructor in economics. He 
rose through the ranks to become a pro­
fessor of economics and industrial ad­
ministration before being appointed dean 
ofGSIAinl962.

Defense rests case in King trial
LOS ANGELES, April 3 (D J) — De­
fense lawyers in the Rodney King beat­
ing trial abruptly rested their case 
after only one of the accused police 
officers had testified, The Wall Street 
Journal reported.
The move surprised observers and 
the prosecution, which scrambled to 
summon rebuttal witnesses earlier 
than expected.
It now appears that the country’s 
most watched trial in recent memory 
could go to the federal-court jury as 
early as the middle of next week.
Only rebuttal and closing statements 
remain in the case.
Lawyers for the four defendants, 
accused ofviolatingKing’s civil rights, 
said they were confident their two- 
week case had effectively raised a rea­
sonable doubt in jurors’ minds. They 
said they believe more evidence was 
unnecessary.
“The jury could anticipate what the 
three defendants would say if we put 
them on the stand,” said Michael Stone, 
a lawyer for defendant Laurence 
Powell, who had decided on Wednes­
day not to testify.
Legal experts watching the case gen­
erally agreed that the defense lawyers 
hadn’t any other witnesses as strong 
as Sgt. Stacey Koon, who was the only 
one of the four accused officers to take 
the stand.
In three days of testimony, Koon 
accepted responsibility for the actions 
of the officers under his charge, and 
said they behaved appropriately be­
cause they thought the suspect had 
taken the drug POP.
On the famous amateur videotape of 
the incident, Koon isn’t seen deliver­
ing any baton blows. He is charged 
with intentionally allowing officers un­
der his command to administer an 
unreasonable beating.
His statements formed the crux of 
the defense case for the white officers, 
which is premised on the theory that 
the defendants were following Los 
AngeleB Police Department policy in
their treatment of King, who is black.
In order to convict the officers on 
civil-rights charges, the government 
must prove they not only used exces­
sive force when they took the Buspect 
into custody, but that they did so in­
tentionally.
Prosecutors arguedin openingstate- 
ments that the officers disobeyed 
policy, and that violation itself dem­
onstrated wrongful intent.
Anothermajor defense witness, Sgt. 
Charles Duke, a use-of-force expert 
with the Los Angeles department, said 
the officers behaved properly.
His statements contrasted with a 
department use-of-force expert called 
by the prosecution, Sgt. Mark Conta.
Conta was particularly vehement in 
his criticism of Koon, claiming that as 
the senior officer, he should have 
stopped the beating.
The defense case was hurt by the 
testimony of Melanie Singer, an of­
ficer with the California Highway Pa­
trol, who delivered a wrenching ac­
count of the beating of King.
She cried as she told jurors that she 
would always remember Powell strik­
ing King six times on the head and 
face with hiB baton. “I will never forget 
it until the day I die,” she testified.
In contrast wi th the state-court trial 
(if the officers last year, the defense in 
the federal case presented a united 
front.
Yesterday, prosecutors attempted to 
introduce as rebuttal evidence a vid­
eotape of last year’s testimony by of- 
ficerTheodore Briseno, who broke with 
the others when he said he saw Powell 
strike King’s head as he was lying 
down, a violation of police policy.
Federal Judge John Davies said he 
intended to admit portions of the tape, 
but Briseno’s lawyer said he planned 
an immediate appeal of that ruling.
The acquittals in the state court 
trial of the police officers last April 
triggered days of civil unrest in Los 
Angeles that resulted in 53 deaths and 
over $800 million in property damage.
Funded abortion 
ban to be lifted
WASHINGTON, March 30 (DJ) — 
President Bill Clinton has decided to 
move toward removing the prohibition 
on federal funding of abortions for poor 
women. White House spokesman Arthur 
Jones said the President “is going to 
work toward lifting the ban.” The action 
is expected to be part of the President’s 
detailed budget proposal being released 
next week.
During the presidential campaign, 
Clinton consistently backed abortion 
rights but never mentioned plans to lift 
the ban on federal funding for abortions. 
However, Vice President Albert Gore 
said last summer that federal money for 
the procedure should be part of a na­
tional health program.
The move would require overturning 
the 1977 Hyde Amendment, which pre­
vents federal funds from being used for 
abortions, except when the mother’s life 
is in danger.
Trade Center 
trial delayed
NEW YORK, April 2 (D J) — The fed­
eral judge overseeing the World Trade 
Center bombing case set a trial date of 
September 14 after government pros­
ecutors said they need at least 90 more 
days to analyze rubble taken from the 
blast site, The Wall Street Journal re­
ported.
Judge Kevin Duffy turned down a re­
quest by lawyers for three of the men 
indicted in the bombing that the govern­
ment be held to the requirement under 
the Speedy Trial Act to go to trial within 
70 days. Duffy said the complex nature 
of the case allowed for an exception.
Duffy also imposed a gag order on all 
lawyers on the case and agents working 
for them. He Baid they aren’t to discuss 
any evidence in the case with reporters.
Gilmore Childers, one of the assistant 
U.S. attorneys in New York handling 
the case, told Duffy that the government 
has transported 11/2 tons of rubble from 
the bomb site to the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation’s laboratories in Washing­
ton for testing.
That material had been sifted by in­
vestigators from an initial 4,000 tons of 
rubble, Childers added.
In the meantime, Childers said the 
government will start making available 
to the defendants other evidence col­
lected in connection with the bombing as 
well as photos shown to witnesses who 
have identified the defendants.
Childers said that 15 search warrants 
have been executed so far in the investi­
gation.
Four people have been indicted for the
bombing and a fifth has been charged 
but not yet indicted.
A sixth defendant is also facing a trial 
before another federal judge on charges 
of obstructing the investigation into the 
bombing.
Duffy also issued a warrant for the 
arrest of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, 25 years 
old, who law enforcement officials said 
has fled overseas. Yousef is one of the 
four men indicted in the case. A spokes­
woman for the Immigration and Natu­
ralization Service said that Yousef came 
to the U.S. from Pakistan in September.
Yousef was detained at John F. 
Kennedy Airport because he didn’t have 
the proper visa, the spokeswoman said, 
but was eventually released because 
there was no room to hold him pending 
a hearing on his asylum request.
The spokeswoman said that Yousef 
missed a hearing scheduled for last 
week.
Clinton supports Russian reforms
WASHINGTON, April 1 (DJ)— Presi­
dent Bill Clinton, saying he has faith 
that Russian reforms will succeed, made 
his case for extending U.S. aid to Russia. 
During a speech to the American Society 
of Newspaper Editors, Clinton said “We 
must do what we can to promote the 
democratic spirit and economic reforms 
that can tip the balance for progress in 
the next century.” But Clinton also tied 
western aid to major reforms of Russia’s 
energy sector as well as its monetary 
policy.
Inflation rates of one percent a day 
impairs Russia’s emerging markets, 
Clinton said. He added that he will dis­
cuss “the progress we are making among 
the major industrialized nations to help 
Russia make the leap to a stable cur­
rency and a market economy.”
“While we cannot support this effort 
alone, and while we must insist on com­
mensurate Russian reforms, American 
leadership is essential,” Clinton said.
Russian aid, Clinton said, “is not an 
act of charity. It is an investment in oiir 
own future. While our efforts will entail 
new costs, we can reap even larger divi­
dends for our safety and prosperity.”
Referring to President Boris Yeltsin’s 
tussles with Parliament, Clinton said, 
“Despite today’s troubles, I have great 
faith that Russian reform will continue 
and eventually succeed.”
Clinton provided no details of the aid 
package that he intends to propose to 
Yeltsin during this weekend’s summit 
meeting with Yeltsin in Vancouver, B.C. 
But he did indicate that most aid will be 
targeted on the private sector and agen­
cies outside of Moscow. He stipulated 
that the assistance must be “tangible to 
the Russian people” and promote the 
development of small businesses,
privatization, and food processing.
Clinton voiced interst in helping in­
troduce modem drilling practices and 
help with repair of Russia’s energy in­
frastructure, which would help Russia 
regain a source of hard currency. “Just 
the leakage from her natural gas pipe­
lines could supply the entire state of 
Connecticut,” said Clinton.
CMU to operate Schenley Park 
golf course
PITTSBURGH, April 1 (CMU Public 
Relations) —- Carnegie Mellon Univer­
sity will take over the administration of 
the Schenley Park golf course, pending a 
decision by the Pittsburgh City Council, 
as reported by news sources. Prelimi­
nary approval was granted to CMU on 
Wednesday, under a plan to operate the 
course under a non-profit plan.
The golf course was previously oper­
ated by the City of Pittsburgh and has 
not made a profit in recent seasons. The 
council will take a final vote on Tuesday, 
and if approval is granted, CMU will 
take over fully in a month.
Military action 
escalates for 
Russia, Georgia
TBILISI, April 2 (DJ)—Russian war­
planes attacked Georgian mortar and 
artillery emplacements in a breakaway 
province on the Black Sea today, killing 
several people, officials said.
The two former Soviet republics 
blamed each other for escalating the 
hostilities in Abkhazia, a secessionist 
province of Georgia.
Georgia renewed its charges that Rus­
sia has entered the war on the Abkhazia« 
side. The Russian Defense Ministi^, 
which has denied taking sides, said the 
raid was in retaliation for Georgia’s ar­
tillery bombardment of a Russian mili­
tary research facility.
Officials said two Russian Su-25 war­
planes attacked Georgian howitzer and 
mortar positions near the provincial capi­
tal of Sukhumi on last night.
Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Min­
istry confirmed the arrest of a Russian 
officer in Sukhumi by Georgian security 
forces. It denied allegations that Lt. 
Alexander Sitnikov had been spying and 
demanded his release.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 5 April 19933Two students to run for Student Government President seat
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Today at 7 pm in the Morewood Gar­
dens Recreation Room, Student Senate 
will be sponsoring a debate between the 
two candidates for the 1993—1994 Stu­
dent Government President. Senator 
James S. Brown, a junior electrical and 
computer engineering major, and David 
IC. Wolpert, a junior history major, will 
appear on the ballot for the position 
during Student Senate and Student 
Government elections this Tuesday and 
Wednesday.
Brown is interested in running for 
Student Government President because 
he plans to work for better relations 
between Student Senate and the execu­
tive branch of Student Government.
“Basically, I was interested because I 
didn’t like the job that Student Senate 
has done and the way Student Govern­
ment has been functioning,” Brown said, 
making the distinction between the two 
branches.
Brown said that the duties of Student 
Government President should be car­
ried out on a daily basis and not project- 
oriented. “I plan to be more active and
more involved in day-to-day activities. I 
want to take the job away from a project 
job and [into] a day-to-day concern. I’d 
like to work on a lot of general projects.”
“The Student Government President 
should be the most well-known person 
on campus,” Brown said. “He or she 
should be involved in everything that 
happens on campus that’s big.” He also 
said that the Student Government Presi­
dent should be “really into what goes on 
with what goes on with the campus.”
One month ago, Brown filled a CIT 
Senator vacancy, but later decided that 
joining the executive branch would be 
better politically. He said that after he 
became a Senator, he discovered that 
Senate had some problems. “I felt Stu­
dent Government would be a better de­
cision than a Senate seat,” he said.
Wolpert had been previously involved 
with Student Government in develop­
ing SafeWalk, a program that he and 
Kevin Bronke, junior in mechanical en­
gineering, created to provide a safe on- 
campus escorting service at night.
Wolpert said that by working with the 
campus community, he felt he should 
get involved with Student Government 
directly.
“My interest [in running for Student 
Government President] came out of 
SafeWalk through working with several 
Student Senators and the administra­
tion,” Wolpert said. “I realized that I 
could make a difference with direct in­
volvement with Student Government.” 
Wolpert plans to continue working on 
SafeWalk and starting a student safety 
committee, which was suggested by Cam­
pus Police Chief Jim LaPaglia in an 
address to Student Senate. “The com­
mittee would monitor safety efforts, in­
troduce new ideas, and act as a medium 
between the student body and Campus 
Police,” he said.
Like Brown, Wolpert plans to improve 
Student Government relations. “I want 
to increase the visibility and accessibil­
ity of Student Government for the com­
mon student,” Wolpert said. “The stu­
dents need to know how to take a greater 
role in Student Government.”
Greg Haverkamp, chair of Student 
Senate, said that the Student Govern­
ment President needs to work hard. 
“Take the position by the reins and start 
it running,” he said. “I’m sure they and 
the campus community could see how 
far it will go.”F&R Chair appointed interim President
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Due to the resignation of Student Gov­
ernment President Natalie Gesmond, 
the executive position has been accepted 
by Funding & Recognition Committee 
(F&R) Chair Dave Martin, after the po­
sition has been declined by Student Sen­
ate Chair Greg Haverkamp and the four 
other committee chairs in Student Sen­
ate.
CIT Senator Chris Morrow was elected
as the new F&R Chair.
According to the Bylaws of the Stu­
dent Body, Martin said that he had been 
interested in the position, but he said, 
“Sitting there, I could see no one able to 
take over F&R.” Martin said that later, 
Haverkamp recommended [Morrow], a 
member of the Academic Affairs Com­
mittee.
“It was a good opportunity to get away 
from F&R,” Martin said.
During his short term as Student Gov­
ernment President, Martin has three
ideas that he’d like to get started. He 
said, “I’d like to set up a committee of 
student architects to go over the plans of 
the new University Center.” He said 
that he has been in contact with former 
Senator Moneet Singh, a junior archi­
tecture student.
Martin also said that in response to 
recommendations from the student body, 
he will be looking into putting benches 
on the Cut, as well as start a security 
council recommended by Campus Police 
Chief Jim Lapaglia.

Harris, Stacy Winters, and Linda 
Corola performed throughout the pro­
gram.
Emceeing the program was An 
Lewis, a member of the Pitt Women’s 
Organization and one of the four mem­
bers of the steering committee which 
organized the event. When later asked 
why she got involved in the Take Back 
the Night March, she commented, “I 
have always been aware of the ‘special 
danger’ that women face. Sexual as­
sault, rape, violence... Those are real 
issues that I think about at one time or 
another every day.” In addition, “The 
last march was a very powerful, mov­
ing experience for me as a participant. 
I was honored to be able to organize 
this march.”
During the time since the begin­
ning, Take Back the Night Marches 
have evolved beyond their original 
intent, to protest the “unspoken cur­
few.” Friday night’s event focused on 
issues ranging from child abuse to
date and acquaintance rape. According 
to a flyer distributed by Pittsburgh Ac­
tion Against Rape, “We [PAAR] are 
marching without fear in numbers for 
an end to violence in the home, in the 
workplace, on the street, and in the 
media.”
Since the preparations for the march 
began six weeks ago, the Take Back the 
Night ideal came to represent even more 
than what was stated by PAAR. The 
march came to specifically stand for the 
Pitt student who was sexually assaulted 
and whose name and address were 
printed in the report of the assault. Ac­
cording to Shira Hassan, a member of 
the University of Pittsburgh Women’s 
Organization and a coordinator of Fri­
day night’s event, the march became a 
response to the recent assaults on the 
CMU campus, as well.
Hassan pointed out that another goal 
of the march was “to create a temporary 
sanctuary for victims [of sexual assault 
and violence]. . . to create a place that 
has that idealistic hope [of being per­
fectly safe] at least for one night.”
CMU senior Biology major and mem­
ber of Asian Pacifica Lesbians of Pitts­
burgh, Christine Tsang also played a 
role in organizing the march.
Correction...
In last week’s story, “Student Senate impeaches Student Government 
President,” Michel Robe’s college was stated incorrectly. Robo is a GSIA 
Student Senator.
In last week’s story, “Greeks sing and dance," the women’s organization 
affiliated with CMU AEPi was identified incorrectly. They are known as the 
Golden Lions of AEPi.

Campus Police catch mugger
By KENDRICK K. CHUA
Tartan News Editor
Last Friday at 12:40 pm, Chief 
James LaPaglia and Sergeant 
William Ricci of Campus Police 
caught and arrested a juvenile 
mugger who confessed to eight 
armed robberies, one of which 
involved CMU students earlier 
that morning. After a half-hour 
chase involving Campus and City 
Police officers on foot and in ve­
hicles, the suspect was found be­
hind some bushes on St. James 
Place.
The suspect, whose name can­
not be released because he is a
juvenile, was found wearing a 
house arrest anklet and bearing 
a large amount of money.
At 12:18 pm on Friday, a CMU 
student reported to Campus Po­
lice that he was verbally abused 
by a man wearing distinctive 
clothing at Amberson Apart­
ments.
At the same time, another stu­
dent reported that he was robbed 
at knifepoint by a man fitting the 
same description on the comer of 
Morewood Avenue and Ellsworth 
Street.
LaPaglia, Ricci, and two other 
Campus Police officers responded 
immediately, and several City
Police units arrived as backup. 
The suspect was caught and ar­
rested, and then positively iden­
tified by the two students. How­
ever, a knife was not found on the' 
suspect or in the surrounding 
area.
“I think this is a significant 
arrest when we talk about vio­
lent crime off campus,” said 
LaPaglia of the arrest. “One of 
my biggest concerns is our stu­
dents off campus.” LaPaglia also 
said that the suspect may be re­
sponsible for other robberies in 
the Shadyside area, includingthe 
one on Wednesday morning, 
March 31.
Why did the local media pay so 
much attention to rape at CMU?
By HEIDI HOOVER
Tartan Contributing Editor
On March 21, a Carnegie Mellon junior reported 
that he was raped on Frew Street. While the Pitt 
News ran an article during CMU’s spring break 
about the alleged rape, it was not until last Monday 
that the Tribune-Reuiew sparked major media 
coverage of the incident with a story covering it and 
another alleged rape on Flagstaff Hill in January. 
Then local TV and radio stations began coverage 
and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ran a story on 
Tuesday.
On campus, a publicity effort began to let stu­
dents know about Campus Police’s walking escort 
service. The administration also publicized its plans 
to improve lighting on campus and make more 
parking lots accessible in the evening so students 
can park in safer areas at night.
An informal escort service was already in place, 
and plans were in the works for better lighting and 
parking. The only real policy change that has been 
made is the specific assignment of one campus 
security officer on each shift to provide a walking 
escort.
Many are asking, “Why now?” The local media 
did not cover January’s reported attack, and there 
was no public response from Campus Police be­
yond the usual Crime Alert posters. Why all the 
attention this time?
Todd Gutnick, the author of the Tribune-Review 
story, says he got the tip from a Tribune-Review 
newspaper carrier whose wife attends CMU. He 
wanted to pursue the story because, he says, “A 
man being raped is kind of an unusual circum­
stance.” In addition, he says, two alleged stranger 
rapes in such a short time is unusual. “If it had 
been just one instance, it probably wouldn’t have 
been covered. Considering the circumstances, it 
had value as a news item.”
Campus Police Chief James LaPaglia agrees 
that the circumstances are unusual. Though about
five acquaintance rapes are reported to Campus 
Police every year, he says, these were the first two 
reports of stranger rape in the six years he’s been 
at CMU. He acknowledges that the number of 
reports is almost certainly lower than the actual 
number of attacks — national statistics show that 
several rapes are committed for every one that gets 
reported — though reporting rates for stranger 
rapes are higher than for acquaintance rapes.
After the Tribune-Review printed the story, the 
other media covered it mostly because the Tribune- 
Review did, according to Gutnick. Don Hale, vice 
president for University Relations and a former 
journalist, agrees. “[The Tribune-Review story] 
caused all the other stories,” he says. TV and radio 
stations often get stories from newspapers. “It’s 
like the pack going after a story,” says Gutnick.
Also, says Hale, Monday is a slow news day. “It 
sounds mundane, but things aren’t happening much 
in the city Sunday and Monday, so stories get 
covered on Monday that probably wouldn’t get 
covered on a Thursday.”
The unusual media coverage affected the cam­
pus community. LaPaglia says it made people at 
CMU more afraid of violent crime. In response to 
this heightened fear, Campus Police formalized 
the walking escort program and publicized it along 
withthe lighting and parking plans. As Hale says, 
“In these kinds of cases, perception is reality.” 
LaPaglia and Hale both say the administration’s 
actions were not in response to the media coverage 
itself. “I don’t think anybody here [in the adminis­
tration] does something because it makes the press,” 
says Hale.
Often, Hale says, he feels like CMU is an island, 
removed from the violent crime problem in the rest 
of Pittsburgh. This feeling is shared by many at 
CMU. If members of the campus community have 
been complacent about crime, heightened aware­
ness of the danger can be beneficial. Major media 
coverage of campus crime, while it may provoke 
fear, also increases awareness on campus. Public­
ity about safety resources can only be helpful to 
students, faculty, and staff.
Campus Police’s walking escort service, which 
will continue until the student-run SafeWalk es­
cort service takes over, is another way for members 
of the campus community to protect themselves.
It is ironic and frustrating to realize, however, 
that the walking escorts wouldn’t have prevented 
the spring break incident, when a student was just 
out for a breath of fresh air.

CMU student raped; police publicize security measures
POLICE, from page 1
Street to look informally for 
problematic lighting and gave 
Physical Plant the task of hir­
ing a team of experts to evalu­
ate all lighting problems on cam­
pus. Mehrabian has also issued 
a purchase order to Campus 
Police to fund the acquisition of 
two new Shuttle buses and one 
new Escort van in an effort to 
maintain the existing student 
transportation services. A pro­
fessional driver for the Escort 
service was alsohiredlastweek.
According to LaPaglia, lights 
on Frew Street and the Cut need 
improvement, as does the park­
ing area behind Wean Hall. 
LaPaglia said in his presenta­
tion to Senate that sodium va­
por lights were being added to 
existing lighting on campus. The 
Campus Affairs Committee of 
Senate is also involved in the 
process of improving lighting.
According to City Police re­
ports, on March 21 atll pm,the 
student who was most recently 
raped stepped out of Porter Hall 
and saw a man across Frew 
Street holding his leg as if he 
were hurt. The student walked 
over to offer help, and was 
grabbed by the man and an ac­
complice hiding in the bushes. 
The student was raped by both 
men. He was later transported 
to Presbyterian Hospital for 
treatment. Another student was 
reportedly raped on January 24 
as she walked east along Frew 
Street around 2 am [“Student 
assaulted,” 1/25.]
The rape over break was the 
center of attention for Pitts­
burgh city media, and reporters 
from the Pittsburgh Post-Ga- 
zette, the Pittsburgh Tribune 
Review, WPXI-11, and KDKA-2 
all came on campus to inter­
view students and Campus Po­
lice. LaPaglia said that police 
response to both rapes was
nearly identical and that the 
gender of the victim did not af­
fect Campus Police’s efforts to 
publicize the incident. Mehra­
bian expressed a similar opin­
ion and said “Gender doesn’t 
matter. The press may find this 
more newsworthy because 
they’re always looking for a new 
angle.”
LaPaglia said that these rapes 
were the first two forcible 
stranger rapes in his six years 
as Chief of Police. About five 
acquaintance rapes, as distinct 
from stranger rapes, are re­
ported each year, according to
LaPaglia.
LaPaglia said that he was also 
concerned about the effect of the 
rapes on the campus commu­
nity as a whole. “The fear of 
crime is as destructive as crime 
itself is to the environment.... If 
wo don’t respond to the fear of 
crime as well as the reality of 
crime, we’re not making tliis 
campus a fulfilling environ­
ment.” LaPaglia also said it was 
“very discouraging” that 90 per­
cent of the Crime Alert posters 
which were put up all over cam­
pus were missing or removed, 
presumably by students.

UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS WHERE 
PEOPLE ARE PUTTING 
TOO MANY RETIREMENT DOLLARS.
Every year, a lot of people make a 
' Huge mistake on their taxes.They 
don't take advantage of tax deferral and 
wind up sending Uncle Sam money they 
could be saving for retirement.
Fortunately, that's a mistake you can 
easily avoid with TIAA-CREF SRAs. 
SRAs not only ease your current tax- 
bite, they ofTer a remarkably easy way 
to build retirement income—especially 
for the "extras” that your regular pension 
and Social Security benefits may not 
cover. Because your contributions are 
made in before-tax dollars, you pay less 
taxes now. And since all earnings on 
your SRA are tax-deferred as well, the
money you don’t send to Washington 
works even harder for you. Down the 
road, that can make a dramatic difference 
in your quality of life.
What else makes SRAs so special?
A range of allocation choices—from the 
guaranteed security of TIAA to the 
diversified investment accounts of 
CREF's variable annuity—all backed 
by the nations number one retirement 
system.
Why write off the chance for a more 
rewarding retirement? Call today and

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 5 April 19937
Crime and Incident Report
3/11 SUSPICIOUS PERSON, 7:36 
pm. Two weeks ago, while in front of 
Donner, a car drove past the victim and 
honked the horn. The car stopped and 
backed up, and the driver asked the 
victim several questions concerning her 
nationality. When the comments became 
offensive, the victim left the scene. While 
walking toward Donner, past the New 
Dorms, the same person approached her. 
A check of the area had no result.
3/12 PEDESTRIAN ACCIDENT, 
1:45 pm. A Carnegie Mellon student was 
driving his car on Forbes Avenue and 
struck a local high school student. The 
pedestrian was struck across the back of 
his legs and, though not complaining of 
anyinjury, was transportedto Children’s 
Hospital.
3/14 FALSE ALARM, 12:56 am. Of­
ficers responded to a fire alarm call from 
Morewood Gardens B-Tower. The floor 
was checked with negative results for 
fire and smoke. Shortly after the alarm 
went off the dispatcher received an 
anonymous call to check two rooms and 
that the officers would understand the 
cause of the alarm. Upon investigation 
of the rooms a sauna was found which 
was making the walls and ceiling wet 
and which may have been the reason the 
alarm activated. The system was reset.
3/14 THEFT, 2:57 am. The victim 
reported that while attending a frater­
nity function the following items were 
taken: a black leather jacket worth $350 
and a pair of gloves. Inside the jacket 
was the victim’s ID and room key.
3/14 MEDICAL ESCORT, 4:11 pm. 
Officers were sent to assist a complain­
ant who was experiencing difficulty 
breathing. One officer administered oxy­
gen until an ambulance arrived. The 
complainant was taken to Presbyterian 
Hospital.
3/17 THEFT, 11:21 am. A couch lo­
cated in the women’s restroom in the 
basement of Doherty Hall was reported 
stolen. The lock and chain, which had 
been used to secure the couch to the 
radiator, were discovered on the floor of 
the restroom. The couch is gold with a 
piece of duct tape covering a rip and has 
a chrome frame with wooded handles.
3/17 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF, 5:22 
pm. Sometime between 9:30 am and 
10:45 am person(s) unknown entered a 
dormitory suite through the bathroom 
and put super glue on the sleep and 
alarm buttons of the victim’s alarm clock. 
When the victim went to set the alarm at 
10:45, the glue was still wet.
3/18 THEFT, 2:49 am. A student re­
ported that a backpack, left unattended 
for 20 minutes, had been stolen from a 
table on the second floor of Hunt Li­
brary. The contents included a calcula­
tor, pen, disks, three text books, and two 
notebooks.
3/18 MEDICAL ESCORT, 8:04 pm. 
An individual was playing basketball in 
the gymnasium when he vertically col­
lided with another player, striking his 
chin on the other player’s head. The
victim was unable to close his mouth due 
to the jaw injury. The victim was trans­
ported to Presbyterian Hospital.
3/18 HARASSMENT BY COMMU­
NICATION, 11:05. pm. An investiga­
tion is under way to determine the source 
of repeated obscene phone calls to the 
complainant’s office in Hamerschlag 
Hall. After three such calls the com­
plainant was able to retrieve the cam­
pus extension of the call’s origin through 
the use of a new phone system.
3/19 MEDICAL, 10:32 am. The vic­
tim was cutting a piece of copper pipe 
with a cutter when the opposite end flew 
upward striking his elbow. The victim 
was transported to West Penn Hospital.
3/19 THEFT, 3:48 pm. In Morewood 
Gardens unknown persons removed the 
victim’s large leather wallet from a table 
where the victim was dining. The victim 
had walked away from the table for a 
minute to speak to a friend and returned 
to find the wallet missing. Missing is a 
driver’s license, $20, andCMU photo ID.
3/22 SIMPLE ASSAULT, 4:29 pm. A 
garage guard observed the victim walk­
ing alongside the parking garage. The 
victim raised his head when he heard 
voices yelling from a passing car and 
was hit in the head with an object, pos­
sibly a stone. The victim suffered a small 
cut and bruises above his right eye but 
refused any medical attention.
3/29 THEFT, 8:02 pm. A bicycle val­
ued at $1400 was removed from the 
basement of a fraternity sometime be­
tween 3/18 and 3/28. The bicycle was in 
a locked room, but several people own 
keys to the room.
3/29 MEDICAL ESCORT, 11:34 pm. 
While playing field hockey the victim 
was struck with a hockey stick across 
the bridge of his nose. The victim was 
transported to Presbyterian Hospital.
3/30 DISORDERLY CONDUCT, 
5:29 pm. While officers were issuing 
internal citations for alcohol violations 
and disorderly conduct to a fraternity, 
some members of the fraternity became 
verbally abusive and continued the abuse 
after warnings to cease and desist. Cita­
tions were then issued and the officers 
departed. One brother followed the offic­
ers on their rounds, continuing the ha­
rassment, until he was arrested and 
transported to the Public Safety Build­
ing.
3/31 ARMED ROBBERY, 11:15 am. 
The victim entered Baker Hall 155 to 
report that he had*been mugged. While 
walking to campus on Morewood Av­
enue near Bayard, the victim observed a 
large man carving something with a 
large knife. The actor noticed the victim 
and asked what he was looking at. The 
victim continued walking. The actor then 
began to follow the victim, eventually 
overtaking him and brandishing the 
knife. The actor took $10 from the victim 
and then told him to leave. City and 
Campus Police searched the area with 
negative results.
3/31 FIRE ALARM, 7:58 pm. Units
responded to a fire alarm in Morewood 
Gardens E-Tower. The area was free of 
fire or smoke. A sulfur-type odor led to a 
cookie can containing the remnants of 
firecrackers in the stairwell.
3/31 THEFT, 9:49 pm. CMU police 
responded to a report of suspicious ac­
tivity outside Wean Hall. Responding

An officer leaving Morewood Gardens 
observed a female exit a parked car and 
run toward the dormitory. The driver, a 
male, exited the car and caught up to the 
female, grabbing her by the biceps. The 
female began to scream. The male at­
tempted to carry the female under his 
arms. When questioned, the female said 
she was a Carnegie Mellon student and 
that Campus Police should not be in­
volved. The female insisted she was not 
injured and refused any type of assis­
tance.

Student Government President resigns
GESMOND, from page 1
at her expense.” '
Haverkamp disagreed. “The impeach­
ment was done simply to demonstrate 
the fact that there is a check on the other 
offices,” Haverkamp said. “People seem 
to overlook what Senate does; there are 
a lot of things in the background.” 
Haverkamp also said that if the im­
peachment was at her expense, then she 
served Senate at the students’ expense 
because somebody else could have taken 
the position.
Gesmond said, “I was elected ... to 
serve and provide meaningful services 
for students. I believe that I was elected 
to produce ,and not to sit at meetings, 
which in my opinion have been unpro­
ductive, where Senators have been un­
responsive to change.”
Gesmond also said earlier that she 
was heavily involved with the Student
Mentor Project and SafeWalk. She said 
that she although she is no longer Stu­
dent Government President, she still 
plans to work on both projocts.
However, Haverkamp said, “Aftertalk- 
ing to people familiar with the Student 
Mentor Project, they said it was a dead 
project.” Haverkamp also said that 
SafeWalk is something Gesmond did 
not even create.
Gesmond said, “I resigned because 
after considering everything that hap­
pened with the impeachment, one of the 
major obstacles was dealing with issues 
in Student Senate.... I didn’t want to be 
involved [with Senate]; there’s only so 
much a person can really take.”
“I never expected this would get so 
big,” Gesmond said about the publicity 
of her impeachment. “Whether it was 
good or bad, it was necessary. People 
have been very supportive.” #:.
Excerpts from Gesmond’s resignation letter
To the members of the Carnegie Mellon 
campus community.
... With great consideration to my health 
problems, I found It necessary to resign 
my duties from the majority of the activi­
ties I had previously enjoyed, so that I 
could then devote more of my strength 
and time to my presidential responsibili­
ties.... [Unfortunately,] I found myself in 
a position from which I was actually less 
able to improve the university.... Through 
this comment, I am referring to Student 
Senate.... In many ways, their harsh, 
Immature actions are not well thought 
out, and they often fall to realize the 
Implications of those actions. Taken a 
step further, their frequent lack of action 
or unproductiveness became a hindrance 
throughout my term as the Student Gov­
ernment President.... Keeping this and 
much more in mind, I have come to the 
decision, through much thought and re­
gret to resign as your Student Govern­
ment President....
I am utterly disappointed in Student 
Senate forthe careless manner in which 
they executed the impeachment pro­
cess. First of all, I do not believe that I 
would have been removed as President....
I am not resigning to flee from Student 
Senate or because I am afraid of getting 
ousted. I am resigning because I am 
completely disappointed with Senate, 
and I do not want to be a part of their 
unproductiveness and immaturity. Work­
ing with them made me begin to dislike 
myjob — one that I took great pride in. 
I believe that I can do more at this point 
if I were only a student, and not Presi­
dent.
With regard to Senate's actions and 
the impeachment process, I believe that 
little consideration was given to the im­
plications of their actions. I'also feel that 
they acted ¡mmaturely as well as prema­
turely. The Senate Chair has not con­
tacted me to discuss this Issue to this
day. This was clearly an attempt for the 
chair and the rest of Senate to try to 
assert their power so that the student 
body would think that they are a powerful 
body ... at my expense. Senate also 
wanted to send a message to future 
presidents ... that Student Senate is 
living up to their poor reputation, one of 
ignorant actions, Inflexibility to change, 
and not putting aside their own agen­
das.... I will be the first to admit that I 
was unable to completely fulfill the obli­
gation to attend all meetings and have 
office hours weekly. During thb time 
when I would not be at a Senate meeting 
or at office hours, I was either In the 
hospital or recuperating from a bout with 
my Illness. I believe that this is an ex­
cuse for my absence....
Many of you would be appalled by the 
content of the messages I have received 
from certain Senators. For example,"... 
For my own amusement, I have decided 
to oppose the removal of Natalie. My 
condition Is that we be spared the de­
tails of Natalie's medical problems.... 
Hence, only one more vote needs to be 
procured from among the Senators. I 
would recommend the CFA Senators. 
P.S. I am subject to changing my mind on 
a whim."
This Is exactly the kind of behavior that 
I am looking forward to getting away 
from. Can you believe that someone in 
an elected position is acting for their own 
amusement upon an issue which con­
cerns the entire student body? ... I en­
courage every student on this campus to 
consider the actions of Student Senate 
... on every Issue that involves you, the 
student.... If you want to improve Stu­
dent Government and see some positive 
changes take place, vote for people you 
can count on, or run for a position your­
self. I can not stress upon you enough 
how Important It is to VOTE.... This is 
your campus, TAKE IT BACKII1

Letters to the Editor
Legality of abortion 
provides no justification
Editor:
In response to Jason 
Specland’s column in 
the last edition of The 
Tartan (“Anti-choice 
tactics include mur­
der,” 3/15), I thought I would once again 
take it upon myself to explain to the 
predominantly liberal and grossly mis­
informed writers of your paper the rea­
sons people remain outright opposed to 
abortion on demand.
You see, there are some people who 
believe that deliberately killing a baby 
in the mother’s womb is a grotesque and 
unjustified act of violence on an inno­
cent and completely defenseless baby. 
This revulsion for what was known as 
recently as 22 years ago as murder in the 
first degree lies at the heart of the right 
to life movement.
The issue as presented by Specland is 
this: if something is legal then people 
should have a right to do it. He takes the 
stance that no one should be bothered in 
the least for exercising something that 
is allowed by the law. While this may 
sound like a nice way to sum up the pro­
abortion movement, it, in fact, ignores 
the relevant history of perhaps the two 
most important events of the world — 
the abolitionist movement and the holo­
caust. Slavery was “legal” in the U.S. 
and killing Jews was legal in Germany 
during WWII. Would Specland support 
killing Jews and enslaving blacks? That 
would make him a racist and a anti- 
semite, but the same reasoning applied 
to abortion makes him euphemistically 
“pro-choice.”
(I use the term pro-abortion because 
anyone who opposes laws on informed 
consent, parental notification, outlaw­
ing abortions in the third trimester, no­
tification of the father of the child, and 
outlawing abortions for contraceptive 
purposes is not “pro-choice” but undeni­
ably pro-abortion.)
In every abortion a genetically unique, 
innocent, and utterly defenseless baby 
is wrongfully subjected to the tearing 
and slicing of its fragile body by a doctor’s 
cold metallic instruments. As these ba­
bies undergo the “safe and legal” abor­
tion procedure that Specland supports, 
their lives are painfully snuffed out one 
by one at a rate of4,000 dead victims of 
the “pro-choice” movement per day.
As I believe I’ve demonstrated in this 
letter, there are literally hundreds of 
reasons to oppose sickening and unjust 
laws — especially one as heinous as 
abortion on demand.

Group spreads Gospel 
through week long events
Editor:
I am writing to in­
form you and the cam­
pus community that 
CMU’s chapter of 
InterVarsity Christian 
Fellowship is putting on a week-long 
outreach event to present Jesus Christ 
and His gospel to this campus. As Chris­
tians, we believe that there is one sover­
eign and omniscient God, that Jesus
Christ was His Son sent to pay the 
necessary penalty for our inherently sin­
ful natures, and that acknowledgement 
of these facts on our parts begins a 
precious relationship with our Savior 
and our Father.
Knowing these things to be true, we 
want to share them with our fellow stu­
dents and faculty in the hopes that they 
too could come to know the peace, guid­
ance, and truth of Christ. With this goal 
we have planned many events to expose 
this campus to the gospel. There will be 
musical and dramatic events in the tent 
on the Cut, philosophical debates, a dis­
cussion on Biblical feminism, films, and 
informal dorm talks.
Perhaps most importantly, members 
of InterVarsity will be around at these 
events to speak with anyone who wishes 
to ask any questions or discuss an issue. 
As believers in the God who created us 
as human beings with the ability and 
right to make our own decisions, we are 
not looking to force any belief on anyone. 
We all must choose for ourselves. Our 
goal, rather, is to relate to this commu­
nity the truth and love of Jesus Christ’s 
life and message which brings direction, 
reason, and joy to everyday life and 
answers to the questions we all grasp so 
desperately to find.
As ones who were lost and have been 
found, broken and been made whole, we 
urge anyone interested, contemptuous, 
or otherwise to attend some of the events 
this week. We know the difference it can 
make. It is well worth it.

Spirituality talk should 
motivate discussion
Editor:
I would like to thank 
professors Richard 
Schoenwald and In­
dira Nair, Peggy Ross 
of the Music Depart­
ment, and Ed Delaney of University 
Relations for participating in Student 
Affairs’ Soup-n-Substance program, 
“Spirituality and Inspiration in Every­
day Life.” To speak so openly about 
matters so private was an inspiration to 
all who attended the event. I’d like to see 
more discussion on our campus about 
individuals’ beliefs regarding spiritual­
ity and inspiration. I think it would help 
us all keep things in perspective, espe­
cially as we head into Carnival, final 
exams, and commencement weekend.
Lisa Lightner

Writer complained about 
petty problems
Editor:
Jennifer Urso’s 
Editor’s Notebook 
complaining about fa- LcttGT tO 
cilities not being open By FHitnr 
during the Blizzard of Xiie cailor 
’93 (“Services wimp out because of some 
snow,” 3/15) helps me to understand 
why a lot of the employees at this Uni­
versity think the students here are noth­
ing but whining little rich kids. How 
dare these people not come into work 
after the largest snowfall (in a 24-hour
period) in the history of Pittsburgh! Per­
haps she should be a little more under­
standing; even the Bishop canceled God’s 
Gig. Virtually every retail business was 
closed Sunday. Who cares! Urso needs 
her Butterfinger bars, and she should be 
able to walk to get them.
Key word: walk. Most employees do 
not have that option. Most have to drive 
or take a bus. No easy task if your car 
was plowed six feet under; getting a bus 
would have been even a neater trick 
considering that none were running. 
These people were “sitting at home, nice 
and comfy with their stocked up fridges” 
because they had the forethought to 
heed the weather reports, which were 
warning about this storm on Wednes­
day, and plan ahead. I would also like to 
ask Urso how many winters she has 
spent here and to check her memory of 
past weather events. Except for this 
year, we have not had snow falls (of more 
than one foot) twice a year. If Urso 
would have informed me about her pre­
dicament I would have gladly ignored 
my back pain from shoveling out my car 
and sidewalk and slid to her rescue with 
a pint of butter pecan and a Slim-Jim to 
get her through these arctic Pittsburgh 
winters.

Editor’s Notebook
Editor:
As an employee of 
Carnegie Mellon Din­
ing Services, I resent 
the comments you 
published in The Tar­
tan (“Services wimp out because of some 
snow,” 3/15). You complained about hav­
ing to walk across campus to get to the 
Highlander Cafe and stand in line for 15 
minutes. I, as well as several of my 
coworkers, walked from home to stand 
on my feet for 12 or more hours and serve 
students who, if they feel as you do, were 
very ungrateful toward our efforts. True, 
our service was affected by the weather. 
Several of the employees could not make 
it in to work and for good reason—most 
of them lived in areas where the roads 
were not plowed until late Sunday 
evening, or they had no means of getting 
to work because the buses were not run­
ning. You seem to have forgotten that 
not everyone associated with the Uni­
versity lives on or near campus. You also 
seem to have forgotten the fact that you 
were fed. If it were not for the few em­
ployees who came in, worked all day and 
night, stayed on campus or walked home 
and back during the storm two weeks 
ago, you would have had to fend for 
yourself. Instead of raising criticisms, 
you should have been thankful that we 
were there.

Enhanced publicity 
creates safer campus
By now, everyone in the cam­
pus community should be aware 
of the assaults that have oc­
curred on and around campus 
this semester. This level of 
awareness is at least partly due 
to the publicity of these inci­
dents by CMU Security in the 
form of Crime Alerts. Recently, 
Security has begun to publicize 
not only crimes concerning the 
campus community, but also 
what it is doing about them.
On March 29, James LaPaglia, 
director of security, issued an 
open letter to the campus that 
outlined several steps that Se­
curity is taking to improve safety 
on campus. These steps include 
publicizing the Walking Escort 
program, improving the light­
ing situation on Frew Street and 
other areas, and opening sev­
eral campus parking lots after 
business hours. It is encourag­
ing to see these efforts on the 
part of Security. However, as 
these plans now stand, there is 
room for improvement.
As WalkingEscortis explained 
in LaPaglia’s letter, any student, 
faculty, or staff member can call 
Security between 8 pm and 2 am 
to request an escort to any loca­
tion on or within close walking 
distance of campus. Unfortu­
nately, the library, where many 
students tend to spend late 
nights, is open until 3 am. While 
LaPaglia has made it clear that 
the service will still be available 
on a less official basis after 2 
am, by making 2 am the official 
ending time of the service, it 
seems like escorts will not be 
available after that hour. People
should feel free to call Security 
whenever they feel unsafe walk­
ing alone. At the very least, the 
Walking Escort program should 
officially end after the library 
has closed, allowing anyone who 
stays at the library until clos­
ing the knowledge that the pro­
gram is still officially in effect. 
Another problem with this offi­
cial end of the service affects 
those who use the 24-hour clus­
ters, and are likely to be out 
even later than those who regu­
larly use the library.
Despite these efforts on 
Security’s and Student Affairs’ 
parts, they seem a little late. 
Two rapes have occurred on 
Frew Street this semester — 
two rapes that may not have 
happened had the administra­
tion been on top of making sure 
that the lighting on Frew Street 
had been repaired previously. 
Of course, the lighting situa­
tion on Frew Street cannot be 
blamed on Security, but per­
haps if a letter like LaPaglia’s 
had appeared earlier informing 
the campus of a problem and 
publicizing the Walking Escort 
program, these assaults and 
others would not have occurred.
It is reassuring to hear that 
some of the safety problems on 
campus are being dealt with. It 
would be nice, however, to know 
the progress on problems like 
the lack of sufficient lighting. 
More updates like LaPaglia’s 
open letter, with more details, 
are needed, and should be a 
regular occurrence. Increased 
awareness is the first step to­
ward a safer campus.
Take Back the Night 
promotes awareness
In defiance of the “unspoken 
curfew,” a result of a very real 
threat of violence against 
women, between 200 and 300 
people participated in the Take 
Back the Night March last Fri­
day night.
We- applaud those who orga­
nized the march — the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh Campus 
Women’s Organization and 
Pittsburgh Action Against Rape 
(PAAR), those who walked 
through the dark streets of 
downtown Pittsburgh, and the 
survivors of violence who were 
courageous enough to tell their 
stories. With violence against 
women not only on the rise in 
the street, but in the home, work­
place, andmedia, any event that 
draws attention to this deplor­
able situation is welcome and 
encouraged.
Marches like this one seem to 
be a positive, constructive way 
of drawing attention to the very 
real problems of sexual assault 
and violence, problems which 
pervade our society. Lighting the 
night with flashlights,, chant­
ing, and carrying signs, those 
who participated in the march 
and rally hopefully raised pub­
lic knowledge of the strictures 
put on people, and particularly 
on women, simply because it is 
not safe to go out after dark. 
Those who spoke out about their 
experiences as survivors took
an amazing step forward in de­
veloping awareness that sexual 
violence affects everyone, and 
has a horrific impact on society 
as a whole. We can only hope 
that mpre than those in the 
immediate audience were lis­
tening.
When people have to fear for 
their safety walldng across cam­
pus, running through the park, 
or traveling through downtown 
streets, simply because the sun 
has gone down, we must recog­
nize that the violence has got­
ten out of hand — and, even 
more, we must do something 
about it. Those involved in the 
march certainly helped to 
spread the word.
By marching after dark, both 
women and men demonstrated 
that there are people who refuse 
to be intimidated by the time of 
day and the very real threat of 
violence.
It is terrible that so many of 
us have to plan our lives around 
when the sun rises and sets. 
Sadly, in the wake of the sexual 
assaults which have shaken the 
campus community, we must 
encourage everyone, women 
and men, to be very careful and, 
yes, a little more alert. But we 
also encourage planning and 
participating in programs like 
the Take Back the Night March
— so that, someday, no one will 
have to be afraid of the dark.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 5 April 19939
Humanity must learn lessons of war
David Hunt
In 1945 the United States deto­
nated the world’s first fission 
bomb in New Mexico, rapidly fol­
lowing with the Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki raids. Since then, de­
spite massive growth of nuclear 
stockpiles in the U.S., the ex- 
U.S.S.R., China, France, and En­
gland, among others, not one 
nuclear weapon has been used in 
anger. For a species that has 
shown itself to be irrational and 
warlike almost to an extreme, 
this is not an insignificant 
achievement!
With the dissolution of the So­
viet Empire, there is increasing 
danger from the sale of nuclear 
weapons and technology. Russian 
engineers and scientists have 
been, and continue to be, lured by 
high wages from nations that 
would like to have nuclear weap­
ons but do not have the domestic 
know-how. Reports of Russian 
engineers leaving their country 
for others who desire possession 
of nuclear capability are causing 
international concern.
We’ve all heard how Iraq was 
attempting to build a nuclear
weapon. Several years ago the 
Israelis struck at an Iraqi nuclear 
plant in an attempt to prevent 
Saddarti Hussein from getting the 
bomb. Sensitive electronic trig­
gering devices have been inter­
cepted on their way to Iraq. Surely 
Hussein has not given up his 
pursuit of the nuclear genie.
South Africa recently an­
nounced that they had the bombs 
but have dismantled them. (Like 
hell they did.) India has “peace­
ful” nuclear weaponry. Pakistan 
has a nuclear arms program as 
well.
Israel has nuclear weapons, and 
many Arab nations are attempt­
ing to gain them. Now comes the 
news that North Korea, already 
considered a dangerous hot-spot, 
has withdrawn from the non-pro­
liferation treaty.
The non-proliferation treaty 
mandates that signatory states 
will not pursue the acquisition of 
nuclear weapons and requires the 
monitoring of fissionable mate­
rial, lack of which is the only real 
obstacle in nuclear weapons pro­
duction. (A crude nuclear device 
is simple: take five kilograms of 
plutonium 239 in two pieces with 
boron mixed in as a neutron mod­
erator. Slam together hard when 
explosion is desired. ) Many coun­
tries have signed this treaty. Yet 
North Korea has been aggres­
sively pursuing nuclear weapons
capability. Their withdrawal from 
the treaty could be an indication 
of success.
The broader picture is not just 
nuclear weapons, but weapons of 
mass destruction in general. Bio­
logical and chemical weapons are 
often called the “poor man’s atom 
bomb.” Any country with a few 
decent biologists can culture an­
thrax (the most popular biologi-
ons in warfare. Others, such as 
Libya, are actively pursuing the 
capability of manufacturing 
chemical agents. Fuel-air explo­
sives, which we used in the war 
against Iraq, are small-scale 
chemical equivalents of nuclear 
devices and are not enormously 
difficult to design.
These weapons have no pur­
pose other than mass slaughter.
The irony is that while the “Red 
Threat” is no longer dominating our 
world view, we and they are contrib­
uting to the monstrous arms build-up 
around the world.
cal agent), among others. Toxic 
gases such as chlorine, phosgene, 
or mustard gas are ridiculously 
easy to make. Nerve agents are 
more difficult but not impossible.
The U.S. and Russia are work­
ing on reducing their stocks of 
nuclear, biological, and chemical 
weapons. A few other countries 
are also involved in the disarma­
ment process. Yet most of the 
world is pursuing such weaponry, 
either openly or covertly.
I’ve already named several 
countries that have or are acquir­
ing nuclear weapons. Some, such 
as Iraq, have used chemical weap-
A “smart boniib,” while a bomb, at 
least pretends to have a specific 
target. Weapons ofmass destruc­
tion are just that — targeted 
mostly against civilian popula­
tions, either in war or as terrorist 
tools.
The irony is that while the “Red 
Threat” is no longer dominating 
our world view, we and they are 
contributing to the monstrous 
arms build-up around the world. 
Weapons manufacturers, desper­
ate to stay viable in a world where 
a U.S.-U.S:S.R. conflict is un­
likely, are shipping planes, 
bombs, tanks, and other killing
machines abroad. At least when 
it was “us” vs. “them” the weap­
ons were under control. Now 
many countries are arming up, 
preparing to defend themselves 
against their neighbors.
In Serbia and Croatia the hor­
rors of war are all too evident, 
with the massive rape of Croat 
Muslim women being perpe­
trated. In the Middle East, Pales­
tinians grow restless under Is­
raeli occupation.
India and Pakistan, long at log­
gerheads, have not settled their 
disputes and probably will not 
for some time to come.
All over the world, inter- and 
intranational rivalries are com­
ing to the surface as the uniting 
influence of “east” vs. “west” ends. 
The end of the cold war heralds 
the beginnings of many smaller 
hot ones.
Humanity has not yet learned 
that war is not the answer. “It is 
good that war is so terrible,” wrote 
General Ulysses Grant, “lest we 
become too fond of it.” Clearly, we 
have yet to see war become as 
terrible as it needs to be, for we 
are still enamored of it. Unfortu­
nately, it may take a few small 
nuclear and chemical exchanges 
before the honeymoon with war

Abby Schiff
This column is targeted at all of you 
students who work. By work, I mean real 
work, not the 80 fun-filled hours a week 
you spend writing research papers and 
reading books with titles like Electromag­
netic Theory. I’m speaking to students 
who hold lucrative work-study positions, 
the ones that pay a whopping $4.50 per 
hour and offer excellent opportunities for 
advancement to the Slightly Over Mini­
mum Wage income bracket. I know: the 
money’s pouring in so fast you don’t know 
what to do with it. But don’t make a down 
payment on the Mercedes quite yet, be­
cause good old Uncle Sam wants his share.
Yes, it’s that time of year again when 
Americans pay taxes. Young and old, poor 
and ri — hmm. Well, most Americans are 
paying taxes, and unless your primary 
activity is sitting around waiting for your 
trust fund to mature, you’re probably 
among them.
When it comes down to it, filing tax 
returns is a breeze. The trick is to have 
someone else do it for you. That’s what the 
President does. Just think what would 
happen if Bill Clinton sat down at the 
White House kitchen table with all his tax 
forms and receipts, sweating over whether 
he should declare the fifty bucks he won 
from George Stephanopoulos in a poker 
game. We wouldn’t have a domestic policy 
until 1997, when Clinton would finally 
throw up his hands in exasperation, knock­
ing several hundred Chicken McNuggets 
to the floor, and say, “Ah give up! Will 
someone please finish these while Ah go 
and make policy?”
It’s no secret that Congress is consider­
ing a bill that would forbid Americans 
from filling out their own tax returns 
because of the mental stress involved. 
Politicians, of course, stopped doing this 
long ago —1983, to be exact, which, leg­
end has it, is the year that Ronald Reagan 
lost his mind while trying to do his own 
taxes. It seems Reagan couldn’t find Table 
23C of Worksheet 49Z, which he needed 
for Line 8,467 of his return (“Depreciated

Shriek “EEEYEW!” if She Saw It.”) The 
President was so perplexed that he al­
most ordered an invasion of New Jersey 
when he learned that a Cuban family of 
four was vacationing there.
Clearly, letting someone else deal with 
tax forms is the best way to keep your 
sanity. But not all of us can afford such 
luxuries, so for the benefit of those who 
have never filed before, I have devised a 
handy checklist and some helpful tax hints 
for cash-strapped students.
You will need:

ceipts, 95 percent of which are unrecog­
nizable to you;
#@&*! tax process?” At this point, it is 
probably best not to think about Jerry 
Brown, who beamed in from the Age of 
Aquarius last year and proposed scrap­
ping all brackets and deductions in favor 
of a 13 percent flat tax. Middle America, in 
a characteristically shrewd call, decided 
that candidate Clinton with his middle- 
class tax cut was a better bet.
If you have any questions while you’re 
filling out your tax form, you can call the 
toll-free Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
hotline and chat for a while. The IRS 
would like you to think of it as a trusted 
pal; it’s here to help and not just when it 
comes to the matter of taking as much of 
your money as it possibly can. I am seri­
ous, folks. Anyone who doesn’t consider 
the IRS a close personal friend should read 
the “Dear Taxpayer” letter in the 437-page 
federal tax instruction booklet. This year, 
the Commissioner of the IRS, Shirley D. 
Peterson, wrote a particularly cordial note, 
concluding with ‘Thank you again for your 
dedication to our country.” Now that’s what 
I call friendly and informative. Here I was 
thinking that you have to sell weapons 
illegally to terrorist groups in Central 
America in order to be considered patri­
otic. Peterson has set the record straight.
Getting back to your tax form, notice 
that the IRS provides you with the option 
of giving extra money to reduce the public 
debt. I don’t know what you cynics out 
there think of this, but my immediate 
reaction was a tearful outpouring of pent- 
up emotion. “How thoughtful of the IRS!” 
I exclaimed. (Note: stop working and go do 
something else after you have finished the 
Jim Beam, unless you complete Form 
29,348, “Estimated Tax for Drunk Indi­
viduals and Branch Davidians.”)
A final, friendly reminder to all you 
students: file a return, whether out of 
dedication to your country or aversion to 
situations involving a 530-pound cellmate 
named “Meat.” If you’re lucky, you might 
even get money back from the govern­
ment, which is taxed by some states the 
following year. Of course, every cent goes 
toward the betterment of our great nation! 
I, for one, am just brimming with dedica­
tion! Excuse me while I get another drink.

Not only would it be, well, stupid 
of me to not clarify this, it would 
also undoubtedly make the Edi- 
tor-in-Chief extremely upset. I 
might 'even lose my job. What I 
really mean to say is that 
Carnegie Mellon students in gen­
eral are stupid.
Why, you ask? Basically, 
Carnegie Mellon students, sup­
posedly some of the best and the 
brightest in this nation, have no 
clue what is going on in the world 
around. Many, many times have 
I sought to engage in discussion 
about a current event in order to 
make my opinion known or find 
out what my associates (and en­
emies) think. Many, many times 
have they responded to my state­
ments with, “Huh? What are you 
talking about?” The level of igno­
rance astounds me.
Before you rush off to write a 
Letter to the Editor telling me 
about all your problems, let me 
say that I know what they are. 
Carnegie Mellon undoubtedly 
heaps far too much work on us. 
Every now and then, I’ve gone 
three or four days without even 
looking at a newspaper. Catch 
me at these times, and I look like 
someone who went through some 
time warp and has no clue about 
current events.
My point here is not that 
Carnegie Mellon students should 
read the New York Times from 
cover to cover every single day of 
the week. My point here is not 
that people should subscribe to
every ClariNet electronic bulle­
tin board. And my point here is 
not that people must ouy every 
issue of The Economist, the New 
Republic, the National Review, 
U.S. News and World Report, 
Time, oiid Newsweek.
Students should, however, 
make an honest attempt to edu­
cate themselves about the world
And then we can educate each 
other. For example, I have two 
friends who, like myself, have an 
interest in what’s left of the ex- 
Soviet Union. One of them knows 
far more than I do. When I say 
something that is incorrect, he’s 
quick to point it out. This doesn’t 
discourage me from speaking 
though. From talking with him, I

I’m ranting and raving in this 
manner because I’m afraid for 
the future. Various parts of the 
undergraduate catalog proudly

their goals and continue their own 
personal education. These lead­
ers of tomorrow, however, will

with groundbreaking research, 
you are merely obtaining the ba­
sic knowledge base and skills that 
will allow you to survive. But if 
you want to prosper, you’ve got to 
do more.

10The Tartan « Carnegie Mellon « 5 April 1993Select your Student Government President
Wolpert offers Student Government visibility, safety 
Gommittee, increased recycling on campus
The following is the platform of 
David Wolpert, a junior history 
major, for the office of Student 
Government President. This plat­
form is being presented as a ser­
vice for the Carnegie Mellon com­
munity and does not constitute 
an endorsement for this or 
any other candidate on the 
part of The Tartan:
I’ve often asked myself 
why I’m at this univer­
sity. I was originally at­
tracted to CMU by its aca­
demic reputation, inter­
disciplinary programs of 
study, and its excellent 
faculty. These things con­
tinue to impress me about 
our school.
Yet in my three years 
here I’ve come to realize 
that there’s something 
missing: a feeling of stu­
dent empowerment — 
power over our own school.
We, as students, are well- 
trained to identify prob­
lems and develop solu­
tions. At this we excel. In 
other words, we complain a lot. 
But we’re very poor at translat­
ing our solutions into action. I’ve 
cpmplained about virtually every 
facet of CMU as much as you 
have, and I, too, have been guilty 
of being just apathetic enough 
not to do anything about my
gripes. I drifted through this 
school feeling that I was getting 
an excellent education but never 
felt like I was making a real dif­
ference.
This all changed when Kevin 
Bronke and I decided to trans-
Kendrick K. Chua/Tartan News Editor
form our concerns for student 
safety into a real solution, the 
SafeWalk program. While devel­
oping SafeWalk, I had the oppor­
tunity to work with a number of 
people from the depths of Warner 
Hall, as well as several Student 
Senators and other students in­
terested in helping us get the 
program started.
Through this experience I came 
to realize something I never real­
ized before: students do have 
power here! We are fortunate to 
be at a university with an admin­
istration that really does 
care about us. The time is 
long overdue when stu­
dents begin to take more 
of an active part in the 
running of their school. I 
am running for Student 
Government President be­
cause I believe I can make 
a difference here.
As your President, I 
have three basic goals. The 
first and most important 
is to increase the visibil­
ity, the accessibility, and 
the accountability of your 
Student Government. 
Few students even know 
who their Senators are 
and yet expect to be repre­
sented by them. This 
needs to change. The Sen­
ate exists to represent stu­
dent concerns and interests. I 
want to ensure that students 
know who their Senators are and 
know how to contact them easily. 
Students must hold both their 
Senate and President fully ac­
countable for any and all deci-

Brown advocates fair representation of students and 
organizations, promotion of more social campus
The following is the platform of 
James S. Brown, a junior electri­
cal and computer engineering 
major, for the office of Student 
Government President. This plat­
form is being presented as a ser­
vice for the Carnegie Mellon com­
munity and does not con­
stitute an endorsement for 
this or any other candi­
date on the part of The 
Tartan.
Student Government 
elections are April 6 and 
7, and it is in your best 
interests to vote James S.
Brown for the office of Stu­
dent Government Presi­
dent.
This office has become a 
joke over the past few 
years. A student gets into 
office, and he or she pro­
motes one or two pet 
projects, doing little to 
benefit the campus popu­
lation as a whole or to 
check the actions of the 
often erratic Student Sen­
ate.
I will change this. I have three 
goals: the first is to become a real 
Student Government President 
— active in representing the in­
terests of the students; the sec­
ond is to promote organizations 
of all interests students may have; 
third, I’m in favor of a more so-not to do anything about my Senators and other students in- Please see CANDIDATE, page 11Gay presence threatens military men’s macho image

of these interests should

cacy, or action organiza­
tions, some of which are 
funded now.
Student Government is 
here for the students. I 
support the relaxation of 
alcohol restrictions for so­
cial activities within dor­
mitories on a case by case 
basis. Furthermore, I sup­
port special allocation 
money for any students 
who will use it for social 
activities in dormitories or 
on campus, so long as they 
are open to all students.
I am running because I, 
like many of you, am tired 
of Student Senate’s wast­
ing hundreds of thousands of Ac­

every year. You shouldn’t have to 
be a member of a favored club to 
benefit from Activities Fee money.
You can put this money to your 
use. All you have to do is check

I will be there to veto it. The 
Student Government President 
will also be represented at every 
Senate meeting, every Board of 
Trustees meeting, and every 
meeting where the students’ in­

Declan McCullagh
Nobody denies there are queers in the 
military. And most acknowledge that 
these gays, lesbians, and bisexuals in 
uniform make valuable contributions to 
the armed forces. Then why the fuss 
over lifting the Department of Defense’s 
(DoD’s) ban on gays in the armed ser­
vices?
• According to Pres­
ident Bill Clinton, 
the problem is dis­
crimination, not 
ability. During a 
January nows con­
ference, Clinton 
said, “Everyone con­
cedes that there are 
[gays in the mili­
tary]. The issue is 
whether men and women ... should be 
excluded from military service solely on 
the basis of their status. And I believe 
they should not.”
But there’s more at stake here than 
exclusion based on sexual identity. 
There’s prejudice as well.
As evidence, consider the arguments 
used by those on each side of the issue. 
Advocates of integration enfold their ar­
guments in sterile, clinical data, citing 
scientific studies and buttressing them 
with intellectual discourse.
Those opposed to integration must do 
otherwise, for with the weight of re­
search data on the other side, their rheto­
ric can no longer be supported by empiri­
cal findings. Instead, the Department of 
Defense has abandoned its previous ar­
gument that gays in the military are 
security risks in favor of saying that the 
ban is based on “military judgement.” In 
fact, says the DoD, this policy would not 
change based on scientific or sociological 
analyses.
By taking refuge behind the shield of 
“military judgement”—the same judge-
By taking refuge behind the shield of “mili­
tary judgement" — the same judgement that 
encouraged behavior like ... the Tail hook inci­
dent — the DoD has made a final stand to 
defend its prejudice.
ment that encouraged behavior like the 
female sexual harassment during the 
Tailhook incident — the DoD has made 
a final stand to defend its prejudice.
Part of this defense consists of argu­
ments that queer soldiers work against 
the very purpose of the military by de­
stroying its ability to maintain disci­
pline and morale. Because the military 
relies on uniformity to achieve disci-
pline, when this uniformity is challenged, 
military structure crumbles.
To a surprising extent, that’s true. 
Heads spin when traditional roles are 
reversed. When a sailor believes a 
bunkmate might think he’s cute, he finds 
himself suddenly feminized and vulner­
able. These feelings are terrifying to 
soldiers, who are constantly presented 
with, and thrive on, the stereotype of the 
All-American Male.
This vulnerability is nowhere more 
evident than in the symbolic shower 
stall. If you listen to the rhetoric of the 
right, that’s the one place where the All- 
American Male is vulnerable to.the dep­
redations of gays. Never mind that com­
munal showers 
are common only 
during a few 
weeks of boot 
camp, and never 
mind that our 
male paragon of 
military virtue 
has showered

The problem is one of sexual identity. 
When showering with openly gay males, 
the country’s most virile men — by job 
description, at least — are reduced to a 
pathetic attempt at playing out an un­
comfortably female role. Afraid of being 
looked at, laughed at, and sexually taken 
advantage of, they must protest what 
they believe are the bathroom stares of

Economic stimulus wastes money
Erik Witte
President Bill Clinton’s emergency 
stimulus package went to Congress 
just this past week. And true to his 
Democratic heart, he lied about what 
is in it and what isn’t.
When asked about a number of the 
programs I'll list, the President re­
plied that they were not in the bill. He 
must be looldng at a different bill than 
the one he sent to Congress and that 
the House just approved last week, or 
he’s lying — and what a shock that 
would be.
The emergency stimulus plan, sup­
posedly stocked full of programs to 
create jobs, also contains the neces­
sary “pork” for him to pass it by his 
Democratic buddies in Congress. Here 
is a short list of some of the “pork” his 
“emergency stimulus package” con­
tains (and guess how many jobs a lot of 
these will create). Most of these are so 
bad they should require no additional 
commentary.
• $10 million to renovate a golf 
course, a park, a cemetery, and a the­
ater.
• $5.5 million to build a swimming 
pool in Spokane, WA.
• $8 million for a down payment on 
a supercomputer the U.S. won’t even
buy until next year. How many jobs 
will this create? And how much money 
do we spend on this interest?
• $28 million to forgive to District of 
Columbia’s debt. Lots of jobs here.
• $800,000 for whitewater canoeing 
practice forthe ’96 Olympicteam. Jobs 
here, too.
• $23 million to encourage Fortune 
500 companies to conserve energy. 
Why shouldthey need encouragement 
beyond just the money they save, and 
why give them money to do it?
• $148million to modernize the IRS. 
I personally would prefer this organi­
zation remain in the dark ages.
• $19.8 million for overseas vaccina­
tion. For a candidate whose emphasis 
was entirely domestic, this seems even 
more out of place.
• $560,000 for air circuits in 
restrooms. I’m not even sure I know 
what these are. (And yes, it is circuit, 
not circulator).
• $3.2 million to compile fish at­
lases. I don’t know what these are, 
either.
• $47 million for a “human reliabil­
ity assessment and enhancement 
study.”
• $197 million to study religions in 
Sicily. This one blows my mind.
• $5 million for recreational sports 
in Puerto Rico.
• $500 million to expand education. 
While this may create a few new jobs, 
most of this money will go to teachers

Two CMU students have 
been raped on Frew Street 
this semester. After the sec­

“The attention from the me­

it’s right that more attention 
was received for the male being 
raped than for the female being 
raped, because they were both

“I think that the attention is a 
load of shit because ... what are

We’ve heard of two rapes in a 
row. Three-fourths of the women 
I know have been raped or know 
someone who has been raped.”

“I’m not sure about the se­
quence of events. I heard that 
CMU invited the press to cam­

happen, and look at all we’re

“There’s kind of a double stan­
dard that if a girl gets raped, it 
doesn’t get mentioned in the 
college paper, and if a guy gets 
raped, it’s national news.”
Reid Hecker/Tartan Photographer
Rachael Keeler

“I think Carnegie Mellon 
doesn’t pay enough attention to 
the rapes. They’re not really 
publicized. Also, I think the cam­
pus isn’t really lit. I know it’s 
something I have to worry about 
when I walk by myself.”

sions made, but itis the respon­
sibility of students to voice their 
opinions. It is your right to be 
heard.
We need to see more student 
involvement in governing bod­
ies. Students need to let their 
representatives know what 
they are thinking and insist 
that their views are heard. I 
would like to implement 
monthly “town-hall” meetings 
where Senators would meet 
with their respective colleges’ 
constituents to hold an open- 
forum discussion. At these 
meetings, students can infor­
mally meet their Senators as 
well as other students and col­
lectively discuss issues impor­
tant to them. These meetings 
would also offer Senators an 
opportunity to tell their con­
stituents what Senate has been 
discussing recently.
The second initiative I will 
undertake is the establishment 
of a Student Safety Commit­
tee. Students need to feel safe 
at this university. SafeWalk is 
just the first step in creating a 
safer campus, and it is a pro­
gram that I will continue to be 
heavily involved with next year 
as the service commences.
But more needs to be done. 
We need better lighting on cam­
pus, improved shuttle service, 
and an overall greater aware­
ness of safety issues for stu­
dents both on- and off-campus.
Some work on these issues and 
others has been put into mo­
tion already. Yet we need a 
body to monitor safety concerns 
and work with Campus Police 
and other groups to ensure the 
continuance of these programs 
and to generate new ideas on 
how to enhance student safety.
A third initiative I will un­
dertake is to improve the envi­
ronmental awareness of the 
Carnegie Mellon community, 
specifically in the area of recy­
cling. Although numerous re­
cycling bins have been deployed 
across campus, my own and 
others’ observations reveal that 
not enough people are using 
them appropriately.
In addition, we need to re­
think the way we use paper at 
this school. I support requiring 
professors to use double-sided 
photocopied handouts. I sup­
port requiring the bookstore 
and all University departments 
to purchase recycled paper 
goods as much as possible. And 
I support constant campus- 
wide education for students, 
staff and faculty members on 
recycling procedures.
These are but three of the 
many initiatives I would like to 
undertake as your Student Gov­
ernment President. I would like 
to work together with you and 
your Senate in creating a more 
dynamic and more involved 
University. I am confident that 
I can do it.
Stimulus package creates few jobs

and administrators. And while 
this may be a good idea, it is not 
emergency stimulus and 
shouldn’t be stuffed in where it 
doesn’t belong.
Let’s force Clinton to pass his 
programs on their individual 
merits. The crime in this bill is 
that it does contain some decent 
programs, and pressure is on 
Congress to pass it—“pork” and 
all.
... and the list goes on and on.
The biggest single chunk of the 
“stimulus” plan is increased un­
employment compensation. How 
does giving money to people who 
don’t have jobs create jobs? Ap­
parently, Clinton never heard the 
old saying about giving someone 
a fish or teaching them how to 
fish.
Based even on his economists’ 
most generous estimates, the
number of jobs the President’s 
plan will create will be at an av­
erage cost of $90,000 per job. Most 
of these jobs probably pay one 
third that much. That means that 
Clinton’s plan is over 60 percent 
waste. The rest is probably not
these programs at all would prob­
ably cost a grand total of five jobs. 
The only way the government 
can effectively and permanently 
create jobs is to lower taxes and 
let businesses spend the money 
on research and development or

terribly useful, either, since these 
jobs are short term and provide 
only temporary relief for the un­
employed.
Clinton would be much better 
off by simply not spending any of 
this money. Not implementing
something else instead—the kind 
of fields that create lasting new 
jobs. Raising taxes only destroys 
jobs by limiting businesses’ abil­
ity to pay people. And worthless 
government spending does even 
less good. What is most shocking
about Clinton’s plan is the fact 
that it actually destroys job^: 
Estimates of the effects of his 
plan include the loss of 1.2 mil­
lion jobs over the next three years
— and these are not from ultra­
conservative groups, but from 
nonpartisan public policy ana­
lysts.
There’s more in the way of 
worthless government spending 
that educated citizens should 
know about. We need to pressure 
Congress and the President to 
enact real change — and end the 
worthless spending that has be­
come a Washington tradition. And 
that would be change, not just for 
change’s sake, but truly change 
for the better.

to face the issue of diversification 
in the workplace. The North 
American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) will influence the 
United States in profound ways. 
North Korea’s nuclear weapons

To find proof for my statement, 
simply look at any recent events
in the nation or the world. Almost 
without exception, one can find 
at least one person or organiza­

Things catch people by surprise, 
and poor decisions are made — 
all because of ignorance.
Granted, taking an interest in 
the world doesn’t guarantee that 
you will know the consequences 
of all actions. No one has that 
power. Making that effort to scan 
the newspaper everyday or read 
the electronic bulletin boards two
or three times a week, however, 
provides you with a grasp on this 
topsy-turvy world. And armed 
with this information, you can 
form opinions and make effective 
decisions.
More importantly, you’ll pre­
vent yourself from being fooled 
into believing the garbage that 
politicians, religious leaders, and 
other “salesman-like” people try 
to sell you. Wars have been waged, 
lives have been lost, and whole 
civilizations destroyed because
some fool found someone more 
foolish to listen to him or her.
But, if you wish to remain stu-' 
pid, by all means go ahead. Soon, 
others will relieve you of the pain 
of understanding things. They’ll 
even get to make decisions for 
you. And you won’t be worth much 
more than the computer on which 
this column was written.

Editor’s Notebook is a feature which

opinions of The Tartan or of the Edito­
rial Board.
So is Skibo coming down this sum­
mer? Sure would be nice to know. I, for 
one, would appreciate it. As of now, the 
administration has left the students 
hanging — we have no idea whether or 
not we’ll have to relocate our activities’ 
offices, those of us who work here in 
Skibo are unsure as to whether we’ll 
have to find new jobs next year, and no 
one knows much about where things are 
going to be in the meantime.
This is a distinctly bad thing. What 
are the administrators planning to do? 
Wait until Carnival to announce that 
the building’s coming down this sum­
mer? Are they going to tell us during 
finals, so that we have to move all of our 
stuff over the summer when no one’s 
here?
No matter what’s going to happen, it’s 
damned inconsiderate of the decision­
makers in this situation to leave stu­
dents out of the picture. We need to 
know what’s going to happen, and we 
need to know soon. Many organizations 
plan events more than a year in advance 
— they must know what’s going on if 
they are to continue to function.
Construction on the tennis courts has 
already started, and rumors are flying, 
but nothing concrete has come out of 
Warner Hall. The last thing I saw was a 
memo that reiterated the uncertain sta­
tus of the building. This is inexcusable. 
We need to know what’s going on by 
Carnival at the latest. Otherwise, ex­
pecting student groups to organize their 
moves will be completely unreasonable.

Gay ban protects fragile concept of military masculinity

their gay brethren.
Of course, thatmay be unwarranted 
pride on the part of thé straights — 
heterosexual males are known for over­
rating their own attractiveness. These 
questions of sexual identity underlie 
the military’s willingness to accept 
gays as long as they stay in the closet.
This acceptance is no recent devel­
opment. Historically, soldiers have 
been able to engage in gay sex without 
significant recrimination if they blam e 
their activities on drunkenness or con­
fusion. That is, gay sex is fine as long 
as the facade of the virile heterosexual 
All-American Male stays firmly in 
place.
However, when soldiers admit same- 
sex attraction, different standards ap­
ply. To be expelled from Annapolis 
just before graduation, Joseph Steffan 
only had to acknowledge attraction. 
That he had never had sex with a man 
meant nothing; the admission of de­
sire was more than enough to incrimi­
nate this All-American Male.
Thus goes the mixed message the 
military sends its troops: Queers in 
the military are fine, as long as they 
stay in the closet. To succeed, stay 
there, act straight, and join the All- 
American Male masquerade.

Is there 
socialism 
in football?
A specter is haunting profes- 
:; sional football. OK, maybe 
! that’s not the original Marxist 
quote, but it fits. The new NFL 
; settlement will usher in among 
1 other things, free agency to 
‘; players with five years of 
service in the League, a $195 
million dollar monetary settle­
ment, increased benefits, and 
the angel of peace to descend 
! from the heavens to bring 
prosperity and happiness to the 
disgruntled player-proletariat.
What bursts my buttons is 
that NFL players call them­
selves “Labor.” Labor? That 
explains why players show up 
for practice in grey overalls, 
sporting big black lunchboxes 
; before punching the timeclock. 
Marx would turn over in his 
: grave if he knew that today’s 
“labor” is making $2 million a 
! year.
The sad truth is that athletes 
, are NOT laborers. They play 
games for a living. They drive 
candy-apple red Lamborghinis 
and eat expensive foods, all the 
time whining about salaries, 
and believing that their inflated 
; egos are worth more than $2 
I million a year.
If they want to know what 
real labor is, have them come 
down to LTV Steel in their 
Armani suits and pick up a 
shovel.
Oh, pardonmae, that would 
mean making a honest living. 
Wouldn’t want to accuse the 
NFL Players’ Association of 
that.
And the settlement only 
makes things worse. I’d like a 
return to the old days where 
players practiced and played 
football rather than collective 
bargaining.
I hope they enjoy their ill- 
bought peace and their stolen 
money, and I also hope that the 
: fleas of a thousand mangy 
J camels infest their jockstraps.
But for some players, it ain’t 
over till its over. There must be 
a line of players longer than the 
line at Highlander during 
dinner waiting to take their 
: best shots at the NFL. Their 
! claim: the League is violating 
antitrust laws. I guess a $195 
million dollar pacifier isn’t big 
enough to satisfy the NFLPA.
And the players say that we 
should be happy. They stand on 
shaky soapboxes, beating their 
chests, and proclaiming that 
play will no longer be inter­
rupted by strikes - until 1999, 
at least.
Gee whiz, I’m ecstatic. Who 
gave them the right to strike, 
anyway? This is football — a 
game, for crying out loud.
Polks, the NFLPA is playing us 
like a used fiddle.
The way I look at it, there’s 
only one thing that can be done. 
Next season, let’s sponsor Free 
Revolver Night, where the first 
500 fans that enter the gates at 
Three Rivers Stadium get a free 
revolver, complete with six 
shots.
Any time a player messes up, 
fans get to take pot shots at 
him. That way, players will 
really be earning their money, 
and it will also get the fans into 
the game.
Can’t you just see it?
Look out, Deion Sanders!

The Pittsburgh Lacrosse 
Shootout washeld this past week­
end, with eleven universities and 
clubs participating. Now in its 
thirdyear, the tournament draws 
teams from Pennsylvania, New 
York, Ohio, Michigan, and Vir­
ginia. The Carnegie Mellon club 
team, which entered the tourna­
ment with a 2-1 regular season 
record, went 1-3 in the Shootout.
The Tartans won their first 
game by forfeit when their sched­
uled opponent, Ohio State, did 
not show up. The second game 
pitted Carnegie Mellon against 
SUNY-Buffalo. The Tartans were 
beaten, 19-6. Graduate student 
Bayard Johnson, the team’s lead­
ing scorer, had three goals in the 
game, junior John Seekings had 
two goals and an assist, and 
graduate student Torsten 
Zeppenfeld added a goal. In their 
next game, the Tartans again 
came up short, this time falling to 
Virginia Tech 8-3. Seekings had 
all three goals for Carnegie 
Mellon. Although they lost their 
final game to Fordham, 4—2, the 
Tartans playedmuch better, over­
all, than they had in their previ­
ous two contests. The two goals 
were scored by sophomore Chris 
Flynn and junior Eric 
Hokkanson, but the real story for 
Carnegie Mellon was the 
goaltending of freshman Tony 
Lee, who turned away several 
Fordham scoring opportunities.
Although disappointed with 
theirshowinginthe tournament, 
the Tartans are optimistic about 
the rest of the season.
This week, though, they have 
two difficult games. They play 
the University of Pittsburgh on 
Thursday, followed by the Pitts­
burgh Lacrosse Club (PLC) on 
Friday. Both teams were in the 
tournament; Pitt advanced all the 
way to the finals, and PLC 
reached the semifinals.
As far as the tournament goes, 
captain Johnson had this to say: 
“We were hoping to do well in the 
tournament. This is a kind of a 
building year for us, and we put 
forth our best effort. We had a 
tough schedule in the tourna­
ment, and that hurt us. The tour­
nament was .a great experience 
for us, though. It was not only 
great lacrosse, but a good time.”Rob Glasor/ Tartan Photographer

but Carnegie Mellon only trailed by 82 points for a 
final total of 3,196 and the second-place finish.
Team coordinator Claire Palmgren said “CMU 
did an exceptional job losing only by 82 points. One 
more rider might have been enough for us to win 
the meet. We did not have enough women cyclists 
to fill the field, which cost us valuable points.”

Penn State University - 3278 points 
Carnegie Mellon University — 3196 points 
Slippery Rock University - 3024 points

Susie Bright gives “sexpert” advice
By LAUREN HEINZ
Tartan Feature Co-Editor
Last Monday, in an effort through the CMU Women’s 
Center, Cultural Center of Pittsburgh, and Cleis Press, 
vibrant speaker Susie Bright delivered her “Sexual State of 
the Union Address” — a speech which filled Doherty Hall 
and also gave CMU students an opportunity to hear and 
take part in a discussion which is usually “kept in the 
closet.”
Bright, author of two books and former editor of “On Our 
Backs — Entertainment for the Adventurous Lesbian” led 
a frank and explicit talk of sexuality in the 90s, encouraging 
the audience to take pride in their sexuality and to locate 
their own, personal sexual identity.
Bright began her speech by discussing how society views 
today’s lesbian. She feels today’s lesbian is seen more as a 
fashion statement to magazines—fi'ail, delicate, and beau­
tiful, than as a way of life. “Lesbians used to be big women 
with beards... more butch, but that image has changed,” she 
said.
Bright feels the media is now focusing more on erotica 
than a person’s sexual rights.
Lesbianism is becoming glamorous, and chic in society. 
“Now they’re running articles about what today’s lesbian is 
wearing rather than if she’s actually allowed to wear it,” 
said Bright.
She also praised Madonna’s new book ‘Sex’ stating it was 
the most worthwhile move of her career, although she feels 
she wasn’t risky enough. “You should see what I could have 
done with a million dollar budget!” remarked Bright.
Bright also feels women and men don’t discuss their 
sexuality. “Every person should be discussing their sex life, 
in person or in private. Sex education in this country is 
about disease prevention and pregnancy, not about why 
people are feeling the way they do and why they want to 
have sex in the first place,” she said.
Bright feels this communication gap ends up straining 
many sexual relationships, because neither side is telling 
their partner what they want.
In most cases, men end up controlling the relationship 
with the women simply condoning it. “When women don’t 
know how to say yes to sex, how will they know when to say 
no?” asked Bright.
Jennifer Urso/Tartan Photo Editor
Bright then discussed how to become sexually liberated while 
still remaining safe, describing herself as the “impatient” sexual 
liberationist.
“The act of talking frankly about sex is what is meaningful in 
finding sexual liberation. The hardest part is learning how to 
distribute ideas...we are pressured to shut up about our sexual 
differences which makes it impossible to come out and tell 
someone you’re gay,” said Bright.
The title of her speech, “Sexual State of the Union Address” was 
molded around this point.
Bright explained she wanted to be the first lady of sexuality and 
work to “stamp-out” erotic illiteracy. “Sexuality is the driving

BGSO takes part in 
Homewood cleanup
By LAURA PALANKER
Tartan Staffwriter
“If you clean up something, 
you’ll think twice before you dirty 
it again,” said GSIA second year 
masters student Nelson Hurdle, 
vice president of the Black 
Graduate Student Organization 
(BGSO), speaking of the group’s 
Homewood Project. Through this 
clean-up community endeavor, 
the group hopes to revitalize 
Pittsburgh’s Homewood Brush- 
ton district and instill pride in 
the youth of that area by clean­
ing up trash and litter in the 
streets. “One of our goals is to 
develop links with the commu­
nity we live in,” said Hurdle. 
“This is a first step in that direc­
tion.”
The idea for the project came 
from BGSO President and Heinz 
School second year masters 
student Dean Calloway, who 
spent his last summer as an 
intern at the Homewood- 
Brushton Revitalization and De- 
velopment Corporation 
(HBRDC). Both Calloway and 
Hurdle have also spent volunteer 
time working in the area. “De­
mographic changes have 
crippled the area,” said Call­
oway. “We want to give the 
people a sense of ownership and 
respect for [their] community.”
At one time Homewood was 
an affluent middle class 
community until the area went 
through a great decrease in 
population between 1960 and 
1980. The residents that moved
out were replaced by lower in­
come families. The net effect is 
that the area has now become the 
largest low income area in Pitts­
burgh; thus, adequate levels of 
goods, services, employment, and 
business opportunities have not 
been available to the residents 
because of no commercial base. 
BGSO hopes that this will be a 
step in changing this.
The proposal for the project is 
to recruit 20 to 30 junior high 
school students from the 
Reizenstein Middle School to 
clean up Homewood for an after­
noon. The students will receive 
lunch, certificates of participa­
tion, gift certificates, and “Just 
Do It — Clean Up Homewood” t- 
shirts, designed by Calloway. In 
addition, the youths will receive 
advice from BGSO members in 
motivational speeches about 
making good grades and 
attending college or vocational 
school. “These young people really 
need role models,” said Hurdle. 
BGSO is also trying to get 
coverage on the six o’clock news 
that evening. “These kids always 
see the crime [in Homewood] on 
TV,” said Calloway. “Wo want 
them to see some positive me­
dia.”
Through tho program, BGSO 
plans to benefit the entire 
Homewood community — from 
the homeless to the business own­
ers — in many ways. They’ll not 
only clean up the community, but 
will establish links between 
BGSO and the school, offer the

over spring break. However, at 
CMU more reports of sexual at­
tacks by acquaintances are 
made. Every year about five are 
reported to Campus Police, and 
most likely many more go unre­

It’s likely that many of CMU’s

in residence halls, though no

she asked Tom to help, he says.

of Housing for Residence Life, 
says that though CMU doesn’t 
collect data on these kinds of 
attacks, “Do I believe it’s hap­
pening? Yes. I have no belief 
that the residence halls are un­
touched by rape and sexual as­
sault.” She also says that in her 
five years at CMU, incidents of 
sexual violence in residence halls 
that have come to her attention 
“were predominantly acquain­
tance situations.”
RA Dolly Shen, a senior and 
psychology major, says she be­
lieves the community and the 
administration “don’t see nearly 
as much as goes on. People don’t 
seem to report it much.” She 
says this may be because it is a 
sensitive issue that people have 
trouble talking about, adding 
that she knows of a few inci-
dents.
The problem of dealing with 
an acquaintance attack is often 
compounded by feelings of self­
blame, says Ginther—the survi­
vor wonders if she or he didn’t 
communicate clearly that the 
sexual activity was unwelcome. 
“If they are confused about what 
happened because of alcohol or 
__________________ and acquain­
tance situation, 
[survivor s'] 
should pursue it, 
get help to fig­
ure out what 
happened,” 
Ginther says. 
“Often they were 
communicating 
in many different ways that they 
didn’t want it to happen.”
Ginther is a member of the 
sexual assault advisors panel, 
which she says is the primary 
resource available on campus for 
survivors. (The sexual assault 
advisors panel was discussed in 
detail in the first of this series, 
Surviving Aftermath of Rape, 
Assault, March 8,1993.) She says 
it’s important for survivors to re­
member that if they choose to 
speak with a sexual assault advi­
sor, they are in control of the 
situation. No sexual assault ad­
visor would take any action with­
out the permission of the survi­
vor.
As another resource for survi­
vors, RAs receive training in ac­
tive listening, counseling and re­
ferral skills, and in resources for 
survivors to get help. This is so 
the RAs can act as peer counse­
lors, says Ginther. Some RAs, 
like Shen, are also involved as 
members of the sexual assault 
advisors panel.
Unfortunately, foreseeing an 
attack and avoiding it is difficult 
and often impossible. Being at­
tacked in your own room can m ake 
the situation even more difficult. 
However, resources are available 
to deal with the aftermath.

story in a series on rape and sexual 
assault at Carnegie Mellon Uni­
versity.)
Passover rules challenge students
“My mother sent me a lot of food I

Junior English major

This week marks the celebration of Passover, 
an important time for those of the Jewish faith. 
During this time, followers may not eat any kind 
of food which rises, or contains flour or yeast such 
as leavened bread. Corn, which is considered a
grain, can ---------------------------------------
also not be 
eaten, nor 
can corn 
syrup, an ad­
ditive in 
many of the 
foods we eat.
Thus most 
sweets are 
out, and 
their choices 
for eating be­
come even
more limited. However, considering the staple 
diet ofthe average college student here on campus
— cereal, donuts, sandwiches, tacos, pizza, and 
beer, such a meal plan is hard to observe. What 
can Jewish students do this week to correctly 
observe their religious tradition?
Hillel, the Jewish activity group on campus, is 
offering three, kosher meals per day at their 
location in Oakland to make sure students are 
able to keep Passover, however, not every student 
has enough to time to make it down to Oakland 
three times a day. They also hold a special Seder, 
or dinner, at their office. Students may also sign 
up for Seders at the Temple Rodef Shalom, located 
on Fifth Avenue and Morewood. Hillel will also 
sell Seder plates to celebrate Passover at home.
“I don’t have time to go to Hillel,” says Daniella 
Topol, freshman drama major. “But eating Mat­
zoh isn’t enough. There are a lot of foods you can 
still eat during Passover, but you have to make 
them. It’s during times like these when I wish I 
had a kitchen. I doubt I’ll actually keep Passover 
this year.”
Nicole Nowitz, junior English major, also doesn’t 
have the time to go to Hillel, so she prepares most 
of her food off-campus. “My mother sent me a lot 
of food I could prepare on my own — Matzoh, 
gefilte (carp fillets), cookies, crackers and 
Matzohmeal, a sort of flour subsitute. Over the 
years, people have learned to make foods which 
are kosher,” she says. “I’ve also been invited to 
some friends houses in Pittsburgh for dinner over 
the week.”
Jeff Kunins, a sophomore Informational Sys­
tems major will also be eating dinners off campus 
this week. “I’m going to a local family’s house for 
the first Seder night. Hillel sets students up with
families.”
Passover is an imporatnt time for those of the 
Jewish faith which also has an interesting history. 
Here is a shortened account of the holiday’s history 
from the Exodus, the third book of the Bible, which 
may help explain why it is celebrated.
The history of Passover begins when an Egyp­
tian Pharaoh ordered that all male Jewish babies 
be drowned in the river Nile because of a prophecy 
that a leader would rise among those born. A
--------------------------------- Jewish mother
gave birth to a son 
and put him in a 
bassinet so that he 
would not be killed 
and floated him 
down a river. Her 
baby arrived at the 
Pharaoh’s palace 
and a princess 
found him and 
raised him on her 
own, unaware that 
the baby was Jew­
ish. She named him Moses. He was raised by the 
princess and later discovered he was Jewish.
Moses then committed himself to freeing the 
Jews from slavery. He demanded the Pharaoh to 
let the Jews be free lest the wrath of God be 
unleashed on Egypt. The Pharaoh refused, thus 
ten plagues were to fall on Egypt. The first plague 
turned the river Nile to blood. Other plagues fell on 
Egypt, culminating in the tenth plague, which was 
the slaying of the first born son of all Egyptian 
families. At night, the angel of death killed all first 
born Egyptian babies. To protect their babies, the 
Jewish families killed innocent lambs and put 
their blood on their doors, so the angel of death 
would pass over them. After the Pharaoh’s son 
died, he was furious and threatened to kill all of the 
Jews. Upon hearing this, the Jews fled, not having 
time to wait for their bread to rise. Thus, they 
baked it and took it with them unleavened. This is 
the reason why the Jews today cannot eat any food 
which rises.
The first two nights of Passover are Seder night. 
Jewish families have dinner together and retell the 
story of the holiday. The Hagadah is the prayer 
book for the evening. During dinner, each person 
reads a passage of the story. Food is served on a 
Seder plate with Matzoh in the center, a shank 
bone (leg of lamb) which symbolizes the sacrificed 
lamb, a hard boiled egg dipped in salt water to 
symbolize the tears of suffering while in slavery, 
and a bitter herbs which signify the bitterness that 
they endured as slaves. They also eat greens which 
symbolize the green harvest when they fled from 
Egypt, and charoset, a mixture of apples, wine, and 
walnuts which symbolizes the mortar used with 
bricks to build pyramids when they were enslaved 
in Egypt.

Spring breaks in Daytona
By LUBOMIR KOCHANSKYJ
Tartan Sports Editor 
& MICKI KOCHANSKYJ
Tartan Junior Staff writer
It’s spring. The time of year when young men’s thoughts turn 
to concerns greater than the endless stream of homework pro­
vided by midterms. Beingjustsuchayoungman, and finding that 
my natural responses to this phenomenon were being met with 
the the strong glares of those offended by my politically incorrect 
droolings, I did what any red-blooded senior would do — head for 
Daytona Beach.
I was determined not to let the undergraduate experience pass 
me by wihout just once attending this fabled orgy of sun, sand, 
and wildly promiscuous sex,
For those who stoically stayed behind in frigid Pittsburgh 
determined to use their break productively, I offer you an insight 
into the world of the Florida Pilgrim.
Sun: yes, there’s lots of it. Too much, in fact to be enjoyed 
without a thick layer of SPF 50. It Beems that everyone there also 
realized this sobering fact once attending the ‘beach novice’ 
color— a charming crimson. The absence of nature’s most insidi­
ous carcinogen at night set the scene for the much-touted night 
life. If you weren’t in a club drinking, you were outside cruising 
in a car lit from underneath with fantastically colored flourescent 
lights. The music both inside and out was deafening, enhancing 
that dazed beer funnel feeling.
Sand: The only place to be. If you weren’t actually in a wet T- 
shirt contest, you could be judged at one, or simply catch it all on 
your ever present camcorder. I personally took the opportunity to 
negate a whole season’s lethargy by playing volleyball at every 
waking moment. Wo weren’t exactly Sinjin Smith’s but the music 
was loud, oh, and there was plenty of drinking.
Sox: The long dreamed of prospect of actually getting some was 
soon knockcd on the head by a number of unlikely contraceptive 
devices. Firstly, the elephant-sized cockroaches that infested the 
cheap hotel room I found myself paying hand over fist for 
demanded the best side of the bed and used all the hot water. One 
look at those, and any thoughts of getting naked in that venue 
were gone.
Secondly, the sight of fully grown men wearing hats resembling 
unrolled condoms was a constant reminder of the times that we 
live in and much like a cold shower.
Lastly, the self-inflicted sunburn prevented all but eye contact 
from being contemplated.
As I sit here, my curiousity sated and my skin peeling, I’m 
actually rather glad to be back. I went, I saw, I got out alive. And 
to those same young women whose icy stares can turn a man’s 
blood at thirty paces if he dares let his eyes or words stray beyond 
the bounds of the CMU code of ethics — hey — I’ve got a 
‘Sperminator’ t-shirt— and you don’t, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, 
nyeh, nyeh!

Neurotic Living
by Andrew Sproule
I heard an alarming news item 
over the past week.
Apparently, one of every five 
elementary Bchools across the 
country is exposed to high levels 
of deadly radon gas (as opposed 
to the rarer, safe, life-giving ra­
don gas).
The report went on to say it 
would be safer for the kids at­
tending these schools to be work­
ing in nuclear power plants.
That was awfully land of them 
to decide which way of dying 
would be preferable to these kids. 
“Should we let them die by inhal­
ing invisible gas or let them die in 
a fiery meltdown? Meltdown 
would probably be best or we could 
send out a questionnaire.” I was 
worried about their health at first
except the report said that since 
they were already exposed to it 
would be senseless to move them. 
However, it occurred to me that 
other problems might arise out of 
this situation.
I’ve been in three different uni­
versities over many years and I 
still have trouble getting a sum­
mer job that doesn’t involve sus­
picious meat products and the 
phrase, “Have it 
your way.”
All these kids had 
to do was to be ex­
posed to a little 
deadly cancer— 
causing gas and 
they qualify for a 
good government job.
“Let’s see, this applicant has a 
degree from MIT in nuclear sci­
ence and this one has worked in 
power plants across the world. 
Really, they aren’t any competi­
tion for little Betty, she’s been in 
elementary school for a few years. 
Hire her.”
Betty, Jimmy, Bobby, and Susie 
will be pulling down huge sala­
ries while I’m stuck saying, 
“Ketchup and salt with those fries
sir?”
I wonder if an elementary 
school would take me back if I 
told them that my napping and 
getting along with others skills 
were failing.
The other problem which arises 
is a little more subtle than the 
last one. Have you ever heard the 
expression, “The older you get 
the deeper the snow and the
longer the walks?”
If not, I’m sure you have all 
experienced an older relative tell- 
ingyou how, when they were your 
age, they used to walk five miles 
in 12 inches of snow with only old 
newspapers wrapped around 
their feet for shoes.
Every year, with new technol­
ogy, I imagine that the stories are 
going to get more and more fanci­
ful.
I imagine our generation will
say something to their children 
and grandchildren like, “When I 
was your age, we only had 200 
channels on TV and we had to 
drive, in a car, to get to school; 
none of these fancy jet packs that 
you kids have.”
After this generation of kids 
gets to that point in their lives, it 
is going to end the tradition — 
there is going to be no way to top
their story. Picture it: “When I 
was in elementary school I had to 
inhale deadly radon gas. You 
should have seen what I had to do 
in high school.”
The consequences are obvious. 
The children of the elementary 
school children will have their 
kids complaining about some­
thing and they won’t be able to 
retaliate with a horror story of 
their own because compared to 
there parents, they had it easy.
Sure there may have been times 
when they weren’t happy and 
things may not have always gone 
well but at least they weren’t 
forced to suck up radon just to get 
educated.
Fortunately, I have come up 
with a sol- ution. (It’s free of 
charge —just a small thanks will 
do).
The government should insti­
tute a program 
where everyone in 
the country would 
go to a place — 
like maybe an el­
ementary school
— and be exposed 
to as much gas as 
the kids are. Then, everyone 
would be even. And maybe we 
would all start respecting and 
loving each other or, at the very 
least, I could get a decent sum­
mer job in a nice, healthy nuclear 
power plant.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 5 April 1993L3
Susie Bright dazzles 2210 
audience with address
BRIGHT, from page LL
force in your life... it makes you strong. You have 
to keep yourself safe, but don’t let that get in the 
way of enjoying yourself.”
Bright’s speech may have been the first time 
,some people in the audience had been allowed to 
hear and discuss sexüality in such an open fo­
rum.
. “Probably for the first time in my life I felt I was 
’a part ofthe heterosexual minority in that room,” 
said Margaret Rohrbaugh, a freshman in H&SS. 
“I think it is something people should see if they 
are naive to the homosexual world. People asked
some really personal questions — things they 
normally wouldn’t say in a room fiill of CMU 
students.”
Katarina Midelfort, a senior chemistry m^jor 
and member of Allies agrees. “I’m really glad 
there are people out there talking and being open 
about topics that people normally aren’t open 
about,” she said. “I think all people should go 
hear her talk — at least be exposed to it. It 
shouldn’t be a quiet subject, but no one should be 
forced to talk about it.”
Bright’s lecture was an excellent opportunity 
to hear candid, social discussion.
Student litter problem plagues 
campus, damages environment
By JASON HEINLEIN
'tfartan Staffwriter
¦' Littering seems to have become 
'¿‘problem on the CMU campus. 
•According to the CMU garden­
ers, whom I interviewed as a 
..group during their lunch break, 
if it were, not for their daily two 
hour patrols the campus would 
.Jje a real mess. The gardeners 
:'f£el that the students think that 
'Ms primarily the Physical Plants 
¦job to maintain the campus “no 
: matter what shape [the students 
:-ifnd staff] put it in.” And ulti­
mately, the gardeners are respon­
sible for keeping it in the beauti- 
$il shape for which it was recog- 
Ctftzed in 1992 as the best campus 
$ Pittsburgh. This is a big job 
:Me to the size of the campus — 
:.£wo cubic yards of litter is picked 
:|u^) daily.
•;';’Every student I surveyed 
¡agreed that trash and recycling 
:J$ns: were available and conve­
niently located. Nick Tuli, a 
Sophomore in Humanities and 
•Social Sciences went so far as to 
:iay that a person “would have to 
be a moron if they couldn’t find a 
•garbage can.”
’•';The new recycling bins are 
itfuch more difficult to empty. 
' They also fill up quickly and must 
"He emptied several times a day. 
Though this is the case, the Physi­
cal Plant gardeners do their jobs 
and empty them, so that the stu­
dents, who suggested recycling 
on campus, can help the environ­
ment. Why then, are just as many 
recyclables found scattered across 
the campus as there are other 
forms of litter? Since all students 
surveyed agreed that recycling 
bins are conveniently located, 
there is no reason for the litter.
According to Carl Framiglio, 
the Physical Plant Director at 
Chatham College, Chatham has 
modelled its own recycling efforts
If you don't register 
With Selective Service, you might 
make the wrong impression.
l^et's be blunt. If you-’re a man, 
wu’vie got to register with Selective 
Service within a month of turning 18 
If you don’t, you’re breaking the law.
Register with Selective Service. 
Its quid. Its easy. And its the law
after our university’s achieve­
ments. Obviously, our recycling 
system is admirable, so it is not a 
lack of opportunity to properly 
recycle that is causing glass 
bottles and aluminum cans to be 
strewn across the campus 
grounds.
The gardeners said students 
occasionally throw bottles out of 
eighth floor dorm windows. Even 
worse is that often other students 
are playing or laying out in the 
grass near where the bottles land. 
The resulting broken glass is a 
hazard to students who walk 
barefoot. Daniel Calle, a fresh­
man CIT student, verified that 
he had witnessed such behavior 
on campus. Calle said that in 
addition to bottles, he had seen 
fluorescent light bulbs and paper 
towels thrown from windows. The 
paper towels often get stuck in 
the trees, and further deteriorate 
the beauty of the campus. The 
gardeners also explained that 
many students throw wet toilet 
paper onto the sidewalk during 
the winter, and because it freezes, 
it cannot be removed. This cre­
ates an unsightly mess where a 
clean, attractive walkway used 
to be.
The gardeners are also called 
upon to remove the posters and 
staples from trees regardless of 
the fact that the signs had no 
business being there in the first 
place. Although bulletin boards 
are adequately provided for such 
advertisements. Several prob­
lems are caused by such inappro­
priate behavior, it takes away 
from the beauty of the campus, 
clutters the light poles. Also, the 
signs eventually fall to the ground 
and add to the litter on campus.
The cigarette butts that are 
tossed on the ground all over cam­
pus are more of a serious problem 
than is realized. Carnegie Mellon 
gardeners said that every day
they remove “two to three hun­
dred cigarette butts from the 
entranceways of each building on 
campus.” In addition, cigarettes 
are often scattered in the grass or 
mulch across campus, and the 
gardeners do not have the time to 
pick them all up. Many smokers 
said that they would dispose of 
their cigarettes if there were more 
cigarette urns in front of build­
ings. However, as Physical Plant 
explained, the students vandal­
ize and destroy such urns for no 
reason. The Physical Plant at 
Chatham College reported simi­
lar problems with cigarette butts 
cluttering doorways and lawns.
Acording to the gardeners, the 
fraternities have by far the most 
litter cluttering their lawns and 
porches. There is consistently 
“three to four times as much lit­
ter” around the fraternity houses 
as there is on the rest of the 
campus.
According to the gardeners, “In 
good weather, there is even more 
garbage.” Framiglio thinks that 
the lack of fraternities and so­
rorities at Chatham College is 
part of the reason why they do 
not have as much of a litter prob­
lem as we do. The gardeners 
painted an ugly picture of the 
campus and particularly the fra­
ternity area after a Saturday 
night party. “Litter is rampant,” 
they explained, and “bottles and 
cans are everywhere.”
Despite the recycling efforts 
made by the campus community, 
litter still seems to be a problem. 
Physical Plant puts forth all of its 
resources to keep the campus 
clean, but their actions are not 
helped by the campus commu­
nity. Ultimately we should all do 
our parts to keep the campus 
clean, and then Physical Plant 
could direct their efforts towards 
making the campus more beauti­
ful.

Last Year 
We Achieved Sales of $60 Billion, 
Increased Our Commercial Services 
Business By 40%, and Spent $9 Billion 
on Developing The Next Generation 
of Information Products.
Imagine What We Could 
Do In A Good Year.
Take a good look at IBM. A look at the 
facts instead of the furor. And what you'll see 
is one of the most solid, dynamic companies 
the world has ever known.
Last year alone our growth in commercial 
services was four times the industry average. 
Our patent portfolio has grown to 30,000 
patents worldwide—by far the industry's 
largest. And our $6.5 billion research and 
development budget is a full three times the 
size of our nearest U.S. competitor.
All of which means that few' computer 
companies anywhere can offer you the 
excitement or the possibilities of IBM. And 
that the world's biggest computer company is 
still home to some of the world's biggest 
opportunities.

Music, lost love intertwine in French film
DIVERSIONS
Two years of work pay off for students in new film
By TARA M. SEMAN
Tartan Contributing Editor
There are some films where 
the music is so unimportant 
that you don’t even notice it. 
This is not the case with Alain 
Corneau’s Tous Les Matins Du 
Monde. In fact, the music 
should probably be credited as 
a co-star.
Tous Les Matins Du Monde 
is based on Pascal Quignard’s 
novel of the same name. The 
film, in French with English 
subtitles, stars Gerard Dep­
ardieu, Jean-Pierre Mar-ielle, 
Anne Brochet, Carole Richert, 
and Depardieu’s son, 
Guillaume.
It is the story of the brilliant 
and exceedingly modest 17th 
century composer, Monsieur de 
Sainte Colombe (very little is 
known about him) and his am­
bitious pupil, Marin Marais. 
Several viol de gamba (prede­
cessor to the cello) pieces by 
both composers are used 
throughout the film. The music 
is hauntingly beautiful and 
adds tremendously to the mood 
of the film.
The story is told in flashback 
by the elderly Marais (Gerard 
Depardieu). Sainte Colombe 
(Jean-Pierre Marielle) is first 
seen arriving home to find his 
beloved wife dead. In his grief, 
he withdraws from society with 
his two daughters, Madeleine
(Anne Brochet) and Toinette 
(Carole Richert). Sainte Colombe 
spends most of his time compos­
ing and mourning his late wife in 
a cabin in the garden, but he 
takes the time to share his skill

Marais is forced by St. Columbe

himself. But Marais is equally

his other teachers’ skills, arrives,

Many of you have probably seen the 
posters around campus showing a large 
submarine and the word “Requin,” but 
you might not have understood exactly 
what it was talking about.
The USS Requin is a submarine that 
served during and after World War II, 
and is one of the regular attractions at 
the Carnegie Science Center. Requin, a 
new student-made documentary film 
playing this Wednesday night in Porter 
Hall 100, captures the lives of the people 
behind this submarine.
Contrary to expectations, this film is 
not your standard run-of-the-mill, flag- 
waving documentary about the glory of 
our men in uniform. It is not one long 
illustrated liturgy of great wars and 
battles narrated by a stiff, old general in 
uniform. It remains respectful of the 
men who served on the Requin, but this 
film manages to add enough personal 
color to make it enjoyable for everyone, 
whether or not one is highly patriotic or 
pro-military.
Requin is the result of two years hard 
work by Junior SDS major Paul Maya 
and senior mechanical engineering stu­
dent Jon Walsh. The film started when 
Walsh decided to apply for a Supple­
mental Undergraduate Research Grant 
(SURG) in August of ’91 with his idea.
He began work on the film in October of 
that year with Paul Maya after receiv­
ing a $500 SURG. Work on the film grew 
from there, as they received a $900 SURG 
in the spring and a $1000 SURG the 
following fall. Final funding for editing 
was contributed by PPG Industries Foun­
dation ($3000), which allowed Walsh 
and Maya to finish the project this se­
mester.
Walsh says that he intended from the 
beginning for this project to be more 
than the standard, dry, single-narrator 
documentary style that is usually used, 
saying “Our goal from the outset was to 
make [Requin] different.” He also feels 
that the movie industry has glorified life 
on a submarine in films such as The 
Hunt for Red October. “There’s a lot 
more to submarines than the movies,” 
Walsh said. They wanted to take a more 
realistic, behind-the-scenes look at sub­
marine life, one that took into account 
the individual personalities of crew mem­
bers and their stories of life aboard the 
Requin.
Walsh and Maya certainly achieved 
their goal, resulting, in a documentary 
that is far from run-of-the-mill. Requin 
is an interesting compilation of personal 
documentations of former crew mem­
bers and actual camera and still footage 
from the years the Requin was active, 
interspersed with bits of a recent Pitts­
burgh convention for former USS Requin
members and their families at the 
Carnegie Science Center.
This compilation allows the stories 
and footage to speak for itself, rather 
than being dictated to us via a narrator 
or single storyteller. This method ends 
up working well, making the subject 
matter interesting and lively.
If you’re thinking this film is going to 
be something like “Paul and Jon’s day at 
the Carnegie on home video,” you’ll be 
sorely disappointed. The editing is very 
professional, and if I hadn’t known bet­
ter, I’d never have guessed this film was 
a student production. It seems as though 
the grant investments into this film paid 
off. Although there is no strict structure 
to the film, it is presented in mostly 
chronological order, beginning with sto­
ries and footage from the Requin’s early 
days at the end part of World War II to 
its post-war reconnaissance days where 
it became known as the “Galloping Ghost 
of the Atlantic Coast.”
The stories told are both interesting 
and informative, and often pretty amus­
ing. We are told stories about the rigors 
of new crew training and adjustment to 
submarine life, entertainment on and 
off board the sub, the feelings of wives 
who had to stay at home alone; and we 
learn various technical aspects.
Whether or not you’re a military buff, 
you’ll want to make sure you catch this 
film Wednesday night at 8 pm.Music to radiate waves at Saturday rave

Special to The Tartan
Originally, raves began hap- 
pening five years ago in England. 
After reaching the U.S., it re­
mained an underground' move­
ment in Los Angeles and other 
parts of the west coast. Recently, 
though, raving,. has become a 
part of popular mainstream cul­
ture in many American 
unversities and cities.
It is a scene which usually oc­
curs in abandoned warehouses, 
clubs, or empty fields sometimes 
lasting more than three days.
Although raving may appear to 
be a trend or fad which will sub­
side within a couple of years, 
many ravers tend to disagree 
because the birth of rave has 
caused a revolution in the lifestyle 
of America’s youth and has cre­
ated a culture and fashion of its around and freeing themselves 
vvn. to
Popular rave attire include t-- On'April 9, 1993, Carnegie
shirts, baggyjeans, stocking caps, 
leggings, and whistles. Ia fact, 
many new clothing lines are as­
sociated specifically with this 
movement: manufacturers such
Mellon’s Highlander Café will be­
come part of the rave wave as 
Recycled Productions present 
Mutation. Several CMU students 
including James Kuo (junipr,
as Fresh Jive, 26 Red Split, and Architecture), Administrator;
Denar Chic.
There really isn’t, any reason to 
question why there is so much 
hype going oh over raves; they 
aren’t just ordinary dances or 
parties.
They are surreal experiences 
that captivate every part of your 
senses, to the point where you 
lose yourself in the music and 
reduce yourself to a fundamen­
tally spiritual level of sensation. 
The beat is deafening — the 
fights blinding. Bodies mergeinto 
one.
Asiflkram (junior, 1MGC) pro­
moter for Recyled Productions 
agrees, saying,'“Raves are a uni­
fied mass of people dancing
Ikram; Matt Drown (junior, math/ 
CS); Music Coordinator; as well 
as Alex Wetmore (sophomore, 
math/CS); Marc Storch (fresh­
man, CIT); Eric Davis (junior, 
IMH); and Sean Goller (senior, 
ECE) are members of Recycled 
Productions.
Mutation is the follow up from 
Recycled Productions’ first rave, 
Evolution, held last October in 
CFA. Word of mouth produced a 
crowd of over 500, resulting in an 
absolute blowout.
The promoters promise that 
Mutation will be much larger due 
to the fact that the two stories of 
the Highlander can accommodate 
700-1000 people. A crowd of this
size will be necessary in order for 
the rave.to be successful.
The musical lino up begins with 
Special K (Kris Kersey) an inde­
pendent DJ who formerly worked 
for Metropol.
Dr. Seuss (Kenny Clunas) who 
also DJs for Metropol, will mainly 
be playing hardcore (loud, fast, 
with heavy bass described as 
“thump, thump’’) and Deisel Boy 
(Damian Higgins) will spice up 
the funk with some breakbeat 
(cluttering of drumbeats).
Afterwards, WRCT’s Techno 
Terrorists (Drown and Goller) will 
spin.
Later, tribal (primitive and 
jungle beat) and trance (slower 
and hypnotic) music will be the 
focus for Simon Gatrall. The rave 
will close with 187 (Joe LeSesne) 
¿^Pittsburgh toclmo act.
All of these people have been 
working together as'an indepen­
dent arid non-profit organization 
called Recycled, and want to bring 
the rave scene to Pittsburgh. Kuo
says, “We just want to provide an 
opportunity for people to enjoy 
themselves and try something 
othor than the regular old 
¡activités.”
That is good advico for most of 
us. OMU students are famous for 
complaining about tho lack of 
things to do around campus.
Don’t think that just becauso 
tho rave will be held on campus 
it will be lame!
There will be a sound system 
including lour subwoofers with 
3600-watt amplifiers and a four 
way system with 5000 watts per 
channel. The visuals will astound 
you with cyberdelic projections 
on a 12x12 foot screen.
For all those sweet freaks ex­
pect to be eating free candy and 
drinking Smart and Stoopid vita­
min enriched drinks. Volatile 
Rave shirts will also be on sale.
So stop complaining about how 
lame the night life here is. Be a 
part of the solution and go to 
Mutation.
Men play 
macho at 
Wherrett
By MIKE SHAPIRO
1 (irtan Senior Staffwriter
Grab hold ofyour biceps and 
pack your skydiving rig. A 
staged reading of Macho 
Manly Men, a new original 
comedy is coming to the 
Wherrett Room this weekend. 
Written and directed by De­
sign senior Alike Allegra and 
performed by CMU students 
and stall, Macho Manly Men 
is a lighthearted farce about 
cultural stereotypes of mascu­
linity.
The story revolves around 
Charlie Poole (Tim Meadows,
Robotics Institute), a reclusive
introvert whose life takes a 
turn for the farcical after a 
reunion with his boorish 
cousin Mitch. The scope of 
Charlie’s challenges turn from 
the athletic to the hormonal 
after he encounters Susan 
(Stephanie Riso; junior, mu­
sic), the inevitable romantic 
interest. Urged on by Mitch, 
Charlie decides to win Susan’s 
heart by entering a near-sui- 
cidal Sportland sports compe­
tition. As a result, Charlie is 
(bl eed to contend with a series 
of amusing athletic tortures, 
culminating in a harrowing 
skiing/roeketeering trip down 
Mount Get Me Down.
Unbeknownst to Charlie, the 
contest has been rigged as a 
desperate promotional event 
by the Sportsland manage­
ment, who fear the impending 
of the Sensitive Man. 
When Charlie turns out to be 
the only entrant, the 
Sportsland president contrives 
a fictitious competitor who 
pushes Charlie to ridiculous 
extremes by always beingone 
step ahead.
Macho Manly Men was writ­
ten by Allegra as an indepen­
dent study with the CMU 
Drama Department. While the 
play will be a staged reading 
lajher than a full production, 
Allegra is very enthusiastic 
out the upcoming perfor­
mances. “I’m very surprised 
“y the amount of talent I have 
ere. 1 m really looking for­
ward to a very good show.” 
x3tedn 3t-lf 3y- will be 
Playing at the Wherret Room 
°n Wednesday and Friday, 
APril 10 and 12. The doors

On Thursday, The CMU Contemporary En­
semble will perform at the Alumni Concert 
Hall in CFA.The Ensemble is made up of 23 
CMU musicians who regularly perform or­
chestral music for the community.
Pieces by sophomore Justin Grize, junior 
Brian Parker, and masters students Kaleb 
Quenk and Mariana Villanueva will be per­
formed Thursday night. A Prokosiev piece will 
also be performed.The performance will be at 8 
pm, and is free and open to the public.
Music inspires French film
3hO“qug FROM L9
Badinage,” and “La Reveuse”).
Jean-Pierre Marielle’s portrayal of Monsieur 
de Sainte Colombe evokes sympathy for the tor­
mented, lonely genius. The actions of young 
Marais, portrayed by Guillaume Depardieu, make 
the audience want to hate him, especially for the 
way he used Anne Brochet’s wonderfully under­
stated Madeleine. But the sadness and regret in 
the eyes of the elderly Marais, movingly por­
trayed by Gerard Depardieu, almost allows you to 
forgive him. The costumes and settings also add 
to film.
If you don’t believe me, Tous Les Matins Du 
Monde earned seven Cdsars (the French equiva­
lent to the Academy Awards), including Best 
Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, 
and Best Music.
New Hellstorm issue avoids comic book hype
By KENDRICK K. CHUA
Tartan News Editor
Hype On:
Death ofSuperman\ 2099\ Youngblood\ 
\mage\Anime\Liefeld\ Cable\Sandmanl 
X-Men\ Legionl Magnusl *cough-cough- 
wheeze-breeeathe*
Hype Off.
Amid massive media blitzes and ad­
vertising for the ultimate comic book, 
the new Marvel title Hellstorm: Prince 
qf Lies is sitting quietly on the shelves 
without so much as a peep. This means 
¿ne of two things; either there’s lots of 
gratuitous sex in the book, or the story is 
well-written enough to sell itself. I’m 
happy to say that it’s the latter. Marvel 
Comics has, for once, taken an old char­
acter and breathed new life into him 
^vith his own book.
Daimon Hellstorm was introduced 
back in the 1950s as part of a crossover 
with the now legendary Ghost Rider 
series. An extremely cheesy, campy, non- 
serious character, Hellstorm was the 
son of a pan-dimensional being who 
called himself Satan, replete with a pen­
tagram tatoo on his chest and a trident 
made of “netherariium.” However, 
Hellstorm was not a willing servant of 
his father, and his goal as a rebellious 
son was to destroy Hell and Satan in the 
name of meaningless filial spite. 
Hellstorm made appearances in various 
Marvel titles, like Ghost Rider, Strange 
Tales, West Coast Avengers, and Marvel 
pomics Presents, but was never fully 
explored in his own title.
Now with his own series, editor Fabian 
Nicieza, of X-Men fame, has been given 
the chance to flesh out Hellstorm’s story 
and explore his current relationship with
the rest of the comic book world. Appar­
ently in the Marvel universe, the barri­
ers between dimensions have been at­
tacked and are falling apart. This is 
evidenced in the conflicts which now 
involve the Silver Surfer, Thor, and the 
Midnight Sons.
The sudden re-appearance of the sup­
posed son of Satan is only a side effect of 
this collapse; we have yet to see how his 
existence affects the rest of the comic 
book world (no doubt in large multi-part 
crossovers and guest appearances in 
other books.) This, however, is the only 
predictable part of Hellstorm’s life as a 
comic book character. The story and 
supporting characters have been mod­
ernized, giving a very 90s feel to the 
book, with humor and cynicism enough 
to rival even the independent horror 
titles or DC’s Vertigo line. Take the 
nightclub he owns, called Helzapoppin, 
which is managed by a shifty gentleman 
by the name of A1 Shaitan. Hellstorm’s 
foil is an exorcist called Gabriel (who 
happens to have a cross tatooed on his 
chest.) Add to this an insane wife, a 
gargoyle servant, and another demon 
from his past named Daimon Hellsirom 
and you have the potential for great 
stories.
The May issue of Hellstorm: Prince of 
Lies features a guest appearance by the 
great Doctor Strange and also a concise 
history of the childhood of Hellstorm 
(and his sister, Satana). Issue #1 fea­
tures a mystical conflict between Daimon 
Hellstorm and Daimon Hellstrom and a 
nifty parchment cover (which explains 
the $2.95 price tag.) The art is by Michael 
Bair, who is known for his work with 
work with Alpha Flight and Spiderman, 
and the story is written by Rafael Nieves.© 1993 Marvel Comics

Thursday, April 8
Diabolique
This 1955 French film from director Henri- 
Georges Clouzot stars Simone Signoret, Vera 
Clouzot, Charles Vanel, and Paul Meurisse. The 
story is a classic thriller about a tyrannical head­
master who gets murdered by his long-suffering 
wife and mistress.
After bumping the old guy off and dumping his 
body, the two women return home, thinkingthey’ve 
rid themselves of their troubles for good. New 
problems arise, however, as they begin to realize 
that they botched up the job.
The twisted plot has been copied many times 
since this film, but perhaps never this well. The 
suspense builds slowly throughout the movie, mak­
ing for a chilling ending. A must-see for suspense- 
lovers.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Friday, April 9
Escape from New York
This 1981 John Carpenter film stars Kurt 
Russell, Ernest Borgnine, Lee Van Cleef, Donald 
Pleasence, and Adrienne Barbeau.
Pleasence plays the President of 1997 America, 
who is onboard Air Force One when it gets hijacked 
by a group of revolutionaries. The plane ends up 
crashing into the middle of Manhattan, which has 
become, in 1997, a maximum security prison.
Russell plays Snake Plissken, a former-war- 
hero-turned-renegade who must get the President 
out within 24 hours.
Somewhat reminiscent of Assault on Precinct 
13, this film offers fun, surprise-filled entertain­
ment for Carpenter fans.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Saturday, April 10
Toys
Robin Williams stars in this Barry Levinson 
Film about a toy factory that eventually gets 
turned into a weapons manufacturing plant.
Williams plays the toy factory owner’s son, who 
is passed up for succession of ownership for his 
military-minded uncle. His father does this sup­
posedly with the intention that his son will finally 
be forced to stand up fot himself and grow up. 
Williams’ uncle ends up slowly changing the play­
ful toy factory, first by begining to produce war- 
related toys, and ultimately by using the factory to 
produce real weaponry.
Nominated for Best Art Direction and Best 
Costume design, Toys offers more than its share of 
interesting visual design. Where it goes beyond is 
left to personal taste. Either way, this film should 
at the very least be cool to look at.
At 5:45, 8,10:10 pm, and 12:20 am.
Sunday, April 11
Planet of the Apes
This is the first and best of the sci-fi series, 
based on Pierre Boulle’s novel. Adapted by Michael 
Wilson and Rod Serling, this film spawned four 
sequels and two television series.
In this film, Four American astronauts crash on 
a far off planet where apes and gorillas are supe­
rior beings to men. Man ends up being no more 
than a beast of burden.
Although the plot is somewhat overdone, this 
film still remains a popular classic. Stars Charlton 
Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice 
Evans, James Whitmore, James Daly, and Linda 
Harrison.
Won a special Oscar for make-up created by
