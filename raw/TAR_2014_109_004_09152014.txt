Clyde House opens to promote global living, learning
BRADEN KELNER
Editor-in-Chief
At the end of the spring 
semester last academic year, 
students were invited to ap-
ply for housing in a new cam-
pus location, Clyde House, 
located at 624 Clyde St. off 
Fifth Avenue. 
Since then, students have 
moved into the newly reno-
vated facility that houses 
students interested in the 
global community. 
The Of?ce of the Dean of 
Student Affairs has dubbed 
the house a “Global Living 
Learning House” in which 
students with intercultural 
interests can explore their 
roles as citizens of the world, 
according to the of?ce’s web-
site.
Renee Camerlengo, Assis-
tant Dean of Student Affairs 
and Clyde House housefel-
low, described the house 
as one in which Pittsburgh 
Carnegie Mellon students 
and exchange students live 
together to gain “an in-
creased sense of cultural 
competency.”
The house has a capacity 
of 28 beds, according to Di-
rector of Housing Services 
Thomas Cooley. 
Currently, the 
facility is home 
to students in 
seven doubles 
and three triples, 
as well as a com-
munity adviser 
(CA) responsible 
for Clyde House, 
Neville Apart-
ments, and Shady 
Oak Apartments. 
The CA has a 
single room on 
the ?rst ?oor of 
Clyde House, 
according to 
?oor plans 
on the Of?ce 
of the Dean 
of Student Affair’s website. 
Currently, the rooms have 
both undergraduate and 
graduate students, accord-
ing to Camerlengo.
The house contains no-
table spaces such as an en-
closed porch that serves as 
the house’s entrance and a 
small ?tness area, a kitchen, 
a parlor common area on the 
?rst ?oor, second and third 
?oor common areas, and a 
study room on the second 
?oor. 
There is an outdoor porch 
?tted with colorful porch 
chairs on the front right side 
of the facility as well.
“You get the suite-style, 
apartment-style space.... all 
coming out into community 
space,” Cooley said of the 
building. “So it’s a space that 
gives you privacy but also is 
very easy to have some inti-
mate, nice spaces.”
Behind the house, the 
university has repaved a 
parking lot and the drive-
way leading to it, which will 
serve as a space for univer-
sity vehicle parking. 
Cooley said he plans to 
provide outdoor picnic areas 
for residents in a plot of land 
next to the lot to grill and 
relax.
The renovations to the 
new housing facility cost the 
university about $1.8 mil-
lion, according to Cooley. 
Demolition of the build-
ing took place in April with 
a proposed timeline of ?n-
ishing renovations by Aug. 
1. Construction of the new 
rooms and community spac-
es began in May, and renova-
tions were completed during 
Orientation week.
Cooley said that with 
renovations, Housing Ser-
vices hoped to capture the 
nostalgic aesthetics of the 
previous building, such as 
a grand staircase leading 
to the second story, stained 
glass windows, and multiple 
?replaces, while updating 
the building with a modern 
look, such as the addition 
of new wooden ?oors, over-
head lighting ?xtures, and 
bright red back stairwells.
In 2012 Carnegie Mellon 
purchased a set of proper-
ties on Fifth Avenue and 
Clyde Street from the Cath-
olic Diocese of Pittsburgh, 
including 624 Clyde St., for 
approximately $5 million. 
The building previously 
housed the Roselia Cen-
ter, a nonpro?t or-
ganization owned 
by the diocese’s 
Catholic Charities 
that helped women 
and their children find 
apartments in the area.
Clyde House was es-
tablished as a new facil-
ity where the university 
can help students to de-
velop as global citizens, 
a goal that Camerlengo 
said is a commitment of 
Crepes Parisiennes applies for liquor license
JUSTIN MCGOWN
Staffwriter
Crepes Parisiennes is look-
ing to provide customers with 
more than its already-wide 
range of crepes, waf?es, and 
pastries — it is now applying 
for a liquor license.
According to documents 
from the Of?ce of City Clerk, 
a resolution for a transfer of 
licenses to the owners of the 
creperie has passed. Although 
it is not clear when the license 
will become effective, the doc-
uments state that the restau-
rant will soon be able to sell 
liquor. 
The expansion into alcohol 
sales is the latest evolution 
of a business that started in 
1998 as a cart on the corner 
of Margaret Morrison and 
Tech Street. There, co-owner 
David Handler sold crepes be-
fore the spot was given over to 
students in the Tepper School 
of Business. It is now used for 
vending freshly grilled burg-
ers and hot dogs.
In 2000, after two years 
of selling crepes from a cart, 
Handler opened Crepes Parisi-
ennes in Shadyside, and four 
years after that, established 
a location on S. Craig Street 
This past August, however, 
Handler chose to close down 
his Shadyside location, in fa-
vor of promoting the Craig 
Street site. 
“We did well there, and I 
took a pay cut,” he explained. 
“But I wanted to build up busi-
ness for this great location.” 
A part of accomplishing this 
goal will be the inclusion of 
alcohol on the menu.
Handler, along with co-
owner and wife Shannon Han-
dler, is looking to increase the 
seating available at the Craig 
Street location. The plan is to 
erect a sun room in the back, 
along with patio seating in the 
interim. 
Handler speculated that, 
with time, Crepes Parisiennes 
might offer a wide selec-
tion of drinks and cultivate 
a bar-like atmosphere in the 
expanded areas. This change 
would come complete with 
extended hours two or three 
nights a week.
Currently though, Handler 
wants to keep things simple 
and classic: “What I really 
would like to do is sell hard ci-
der,” he said. “It’s traditional.” 
His idea corresponds with 
a practice stemming from the 
Brittany region of France. 
The area is known both for 
its crepes and hard cider, 
which Handler said pair well 
together. 
He has not decided on 
what brand he would like to 
serve, but he is already consid-
ering his options. He says he is 
contemplating both imports 
and Arsenal Cider, a local hard 
cider made in Lawrenceville. 
Whichever label is chosen, 
Handler is sure it will match 
harmoniously with the exist-
ing fare.
The changes to Crepes 
Parisiennes’ menu come in a 
time of changes for the Craig 
Street corridor. Over the sum-
mer, the Panther Hollow Inn 
at 4611 Forbes Ave. closed its 
doors for the last time, and 
will be replaced in the coming 
months with a Chipotle Mexi-
can Grill. 
The university is also in-
vesting in Craig Street; last 
year the PNC Bank on the 
corner of Forbes Avenue and 
S. Craig Street was replaced 
by the university’s Integrated 
Innovation Institute. 
The Carnegie Mellon com-
munity seems to be look-
ing forward to the coming 
developments at the crepe-
rie. “I think it’s interesting,” 
sophomore computer sci-
ence and mathematics major 
Aaron Friedlander said. “The 
thought of crepes and alcohol 
could be fun.” 
Even Cage Schmidt, who 
often works at the Creperie in 
the Jared L. Cohon University 
Center, a competitor to Crepes 
Parisiennes, is excited for the 
coming changes. Schmidt said, 
“I de?nitely want to go down 
there. I’ll take my girlfriend — 
she can’t drink but I will.”

The National Science 
Foundation (NSF) an-
nounced recently that it 
is giving Carnegie Mellon 
$5.6 million in grant money 
through the CyberCorps 
Scholarship for Service 
(SFS). The SFS is a federal 
program that provides full-
tuition scholarships for stu-
dents who show promise 
in careers strengthening 
the nation’s cybersecurity 
infrastructure.
This is not the ?rst time 
that the NSF has given 
money to Carnegie Mellon 
to fund cybersecurity edu-
cation — the SFS program 
has been active at the uni-
versity for over 10 years, 
handing out a total of over 
$21.6 million in awards and 
scholarships. This year’s 
grant, however, is the larg-
est award to date, according 
to Dena Haritos Tsamitis, 
director of the College of 
Engineering’s Information 
Networking Institute (INI), 
in a university news release.

This week in Tianjin, 
China, the World Economic 
Forum’s Summer Davos will 
host a “Data Science in Ac-
tion” session, featuring four 
Carnegie Mellon faculty 
members. Carnegie Mellon 
began working with the 
World Economic Forum in 
2010, when the university 
joined the Global Universi-
ty Leaders Forum (GULF). 
GULF brings together 25 in-
ternational universities to 
create an open dialogue on 
affairs of higher education, 
research, and global policy. 
15 Carnegie Mellon faculty 
members have presented at 
GULF meetings since 2010.
University President Sub-
ra Suresh will introduce the 
session, which explores how 
to evaluate and use large 
amounts of data from diverse 
?elds. Professor of psychol-
ogy Marlene Behrmann’s 
discussion on data looks into 
how autism can be better 
predicted by analyzing brain 
signal pathways in autistic 
individuals. In the ?eld of 
engineering, James H. Gar-
rett Jr., dean of the College 
of Engineering and Thomas 
Lord, professor of civil and 
environmental engineering, 
will explore the enormous 
cost-cutting potential of sen-
sors collecting water in sewer 
pipes, buildings, and bridges. 
These sensors detect the po-
tential for damage before it 
occurs.
Marsha Lovett, a profes-
sor of psychology at Carn-
egie Mellon, will present 
her research on data from 
student use of online learn-
ing software. This research 
could be used to individual-
ize users’ experiences, there-
by strengthening the edu-
cational experience online.

Also attending the forum 
are three Carnegie Mel-
lon scientists nominated as 
“40 under 40” young sci-
entists, who will be com-
menting on the sessions 
with their knowledge of 
cutting-edge scienti?c re-
search. President Suresh will

“The aspiration for Clyde 
House is that half the resi-
dents will be from the Pitts-
burgh campus and the other 
half of the residents will be ex-
change students in Pittsburgh 
for the semester,” Camerlengo 
said via email. “With robust 
discussions and activities in 
the community and guests 
who will share a global per-
spective, it’s hoped that stu-
dents ?nd this to be a learning 
environment that they enjoy 
[and] feel connected to.”
A contributing in?uence 
to the house’s establishment 
this semester was the approxi-
mately 20 students from Carn-
egie Mellon’s Qatar campus 
who study in Pittsburgh each 
semester, according to Ca-
merlengo. The house was 
“intended to be able to pro-
vide an optimal living experi-
ence for exchange students,” 
she said.
There are currently ex-
change students from several 
countries, including Qatar, 
living in Clyde House this 
semester.
The house requires stu-
dents to fill out an applica-
tion to live in the building, 
similar to applications for 
such housing facilities as

are U.S. citizens who have 
been accepted into Carnegie 
Mellon’s graduate programs 
in information security or 
information security policy 
at the Heinz College or Col-

program awards students 
full-tuition scholarships and 
sometimes stipends; students 
who receive scholarships 
through the program commit 
to a summer internship with 
a participating federal agency 
and one year of federal em-
ployment for every year they 
spend earning their degree.
Over the course of the 
program’s history at Carn-
egie Mellon, over 157 gradu-
ates have gone on to work for 
the Department of Defense, 
Department of Justice, and 
other federal departments.
Allison Boos, a 2014 
graduate of the program, is 
working as an IT specialist in 
the Criminal Division of the 
Department of Justice. Boos 
studied information security 
at the INI through the SFS 
program and spent a summer 
interning at the Federal Re-
serve Bank of San Francisco 
as part of the National Inci-
dent Response Team.
“The experience of being 
an SFS student not only pro-
vided me with the education

The INI is a graduate 
school with degree programs 
in information networking; 
information security; and in-
formation technology mobil-

software management. Since 
Tsamitis began directing the 
INI in 2004, it has earned the 
Center of Academic Excel-
lence (CAE) in information 
assurance/cyber defense ed-

ance/cyber defense research, 
and cyber operations. The 
CAE is a federal recognition 
established in the wake of 
President Obama’s National 
Initiative for Cybersecurity 
Education (NICE) and over-
seen by the National Security 
Agency.
“Our graduates in infor-

Google to make its own quantum processors
Google recently announced 
its plan to make quantum 
processors using supercon-
ductors. Google is already in-
volved in quantum computer 
research through the Quan-
tum Arti?cial Intelligence Lab, 
whose members now run their 
experiments on a D-Wave 
Two device, the successor of 
D-Wave One and the world’s 
only commercially available 
quantum computer. 
Compared to traditional 
computers, quantum comput-
ers are believed to be helpful 
for optimization problems. In 
digital computers, data are en-
coded into binary digits (bits), 
which has two de?nite states 
(0 and 1), whereas quantum 
computation uses qubits that 
can be in superpositions of 
states. However, quantum 
computers haven’t yet proven 
to be faster than classical com-
puters, partly because they are 
currently only in prototype 
stages. Thus, Google is still 
working with the lab research-
ers, including scientists from 
NASA and universities, to seek 
further improvement.

Scientists say ozone layer is on way to recovery
UN scientists claim that 
Earth’s protective but fragile 
ozone layer is gradually re-
covering, partly due to the re-
duction of chloro?uorocarbon 
(CFC) use and international 
collaborations to wean away 
from CFCs. Since 1974, there 
have been warnings about 
ozone depletion, which can 
be devastating because of the 
ozone’s ability to shield dam-
aging ultraviolet (UV) light 
from the sun. Excessive expo-
sure to UV may lead to skin 
cancer. Interestingly, carbon 
dioxide, commonly known 
as a major greenhouse gas, 
is believed to cool the upper 
stratosphere, and the cooled 
air increases the amount of 
ozone. While this news is en-
couraging, scientists still warn 
that the ozone layer is far from 
being healed. 
The long-lasting, ozone-
eating chemicals are still dam-
aging the ozone levels while 
it is recovering. According to 
NASA scientist Paul A. New-
man, the ozone layer is still ap-
proximately 6 percent thinner 
than it was in 1980.

NASA to give International Space Station 3-D printer
According to a recent plan, 
NASA will send a 3-D printer 
to the International Space 
Station (ISS), which, accord-
ing to some engineers and re-
searchers at NASA, is a “design 
revolution.” 
Traditionally, astronauts 
had to bring tools and parts 
in order to replace broken 
parts; but now with this 3-D 
printer, “if you have 300 dif-
ferent things that could break 
on your spacecraft, you may 
not need to carry replacement 
parts for all 300 of them,” said 
Dwayne Day, a senior pro-
gram of?cer at the National 
Research Council. Having a 
3-D printer may even allow as-
tronauts to invent useful new 
tools while in space.
The 3-D printer was made 
to be resistant to drastic tem-
perature change. However, the 
fact that heat ?ows differently 
in microgravity could mean 
that some parts of the plastic 
will become too hot or too cool 
for the printing to work prop-
erly. The printer was designed 
by Made In Space, a Silicon 
Valley venture.

African monster that breaks 
the mold for how a dinosaur 
predator looked and behaved 
— it is even nine feet longer 
than the Tyrannosaurus rex 
(T. rex). 
Spinosaurus is known for 
its water-adapting lifestyle, 
and it was the only known qua-
drupedal dinosaur predator, 
compared to its two-legged 
counterparts, like T.rex.
Most of the information 
about Spinosaurus was lost 
during World War II, when 
fossils discovered earlier were 
destroyed in Germany. 
Recently, some partial 
skeletons were again found 
in Morroco, and an accurate 
reconstruction of Spinosau-
rus ?nally evolved. Spino-
saurus had “powerful jaws 
and teeth.… It probably had 
outsized arms, with ?ashing 
scythe-like claws,” said Paul 
Sereno, one of the scientists 
who reported the ?nd.

Mystery of missing lithium extends beyond Milky Way
It is universally believed 
that within three minutes of 
the Big Bang, the universe was 
created with mostly hydrogen 
and helium, with a certain 
amount of lithium (the ?rst 
three elements in the periodic 
table). While the presence of 
the ?rst two in our universe 
has been long con?rmed, there 
seems to be only about one-
third as much lithium in the 
old stars as there should be. 
For many years this problem 
troubled scientists, causing 
them to rethink whether the 
models of the early universe 
are accurate. Recently, it has 
been con?rmed that this prob-
lem is not unique to the Milky 
Way. Astronomers turned the 
Very Large Telescope in Chile 
toward Messier 54 (M54), a 
distant start cluster that is part 
of a tiny galaxy. According to 
the observations published on 
Sept. 9, the problem of lithium 
is not just limited to the scope 
of the Milky Way, but some ex-
ternal galaxies as well. Thus, 
where the lithium goes re-
mains a problem for current 
astronomy.

Apple smartwatch is Apple’s most personal device
Though not the ?rst tech-
nology company making 
smartwatches and wearable 
technology, Apple unveiled 
its long-anticipated wearable 
smartwatch on Sept. 9. Apple 
CEO Tim Cook introduced the 
device, which is much like a 
wearable iPhone, but smaller. 
Cook hailed it as one of the 
most personal devices Apple 
has ever created: The Apple 
Watch can serve as a draw-
ing pad, pulse monitor, music 
player, and an email receiver, 
among other things, that is 
always only an arm’s length 
away.
Instead of simply shrink-
ing the iPhone screen, Cook 
claimed that Apple designed 
a new interface for the smart-
watch, using what it calls a 
digital crown, or a knob on the 
side of the watch. 
Apple is also working close-
ly with app developers to in-
crease the functionality of its 
product with new uses.

The Internet of Things transforms our relation with world
ABHINAV GAUTAM

Quick: How many of the 
things you interact with daily 
are connected to the Internet? 
Probably a smartphone and 
maybe a smart watch or an ac-
tivity monitor wristband. 
How about in your home? 
A computer, TV, game con-
sole, or even a coffee maker 
that can download different 
recipes for your coffee in the 
morning.
Chad Jones, an entrepre-
neur, an angel investor, and an 
adviser to multiple startups, 
gave a human-computer in-
teraction seminar lecture last 
Wednesday in Newell-Simon 
Hall 1305, titled “Transform-
ing Human Interaction with 
our World Through the Inter-
net of Things.” 
In the lecture, he ad-
dressed the transformation 
of how we discover, sense, 
and interact with the physical 
world through the Internet of 
Things, the idea that we are 
moving toward a world where 
all physical objects will run 
software that is connected to 
the Internet.
Jones opened his lecture by 
calling the Internet of Things 
“the next great paradigm shift 
not only in technology, but 
mankind as well.” He sum-
marized how the evolution of 
the Internet occurred. Before 
2000, about 1.8 billion com-
puters were connected with 
each other. Then, in the mid 
2000s, over 10 billion devices 
were connected to the Inter-
net, mainly due to the emer-
gence of mobile devices. 
But the next evolution is 
already happening, where “ev-
erything” is connecting to the 
Internet, with an estimate of 1 
trillion connections to the In-
ternet by 2030. 
This growth of Internet-
connected devices has led to 
the Internet of Things, the 
concept that any device with 
an On/Off switch connects to 
the Internet directly, or indi-
rectly through another device.
Jones said that we are al-
ready seeing examples of this 
evolution in different areas, 
and opportunities are every-
where. It is not a question of 
“where [we] can apply this, 
[but] a question [of] where 
we cannot,” Jones said. He 
showed examples of where 
these devices already ex-
ist, from a smart thermostat 
like Nest in the home that 
knows when you are home 
and adjusts the temperature 
automatically based on your 
preferences, to things like a 
basketball with a motion sen-
sor that can tell how good your 
dribble is.
He also shared an example 
of an everyday object that is all 
over the world. There are over 
1 billion street lamps in the 
world that today only light up 
our streets at night. But Jones 
stated that a “street lamp can 
become a platform and pro-
vide a lot more than just light.” 
The lamp can serve as a Wi-Fi 
hotspot, provide announce-
ments, and serve as digital sig-
nage that can advertise nearby 
events or provide directions.
The street lamp is just one 
of many ways we can make 
cities smarter where devices 
connected to the Internet can 
provide useful information 
to everyone. For example, 
Internet-connected parking 
meters can help drivers ?nd 
the closest available parking 
lot. Underground water pipes 
could alert the city if there 
are any stresses in the system 
and prevent a possible leakage 
from shutting down parts of 
the city.
So what has led to this 
evolution and why now? 
Jones said that this evolution 
has been the result of trends 
in technology and business. 
Electronics such as computer 
chips, sensors, and batteries 
are getting smaller and small-
er, and can be placed in small-
er devices. More devices have 
sensors and are able to share 
their data with other devices 
through cloud computing. 
It is much cheaper to pro-
duce the electronics in these 
devices and the devices them-
selves, thus allowing them 
to become “smarter.” Jones 
stated that though sensors in 
devices and electronics have 
existed for decades, it’s “the 
Internet that has tied every-
thing together.” Having the 
ability to share the data gener-
ated by the sensors in devices 
is what makes them “smart” 
and creates the Internet of 
Things.
A good example of how 
the Internet of Things can be 
useful is a problem that a lot 
of people face during winter 
storms. Jones shared that, in 
his hometown of Boston, two 
days before a major winter 
storm hits, people using oil 
tanks to warm their houses 
call oil companies to ?ll their 
tanks, which leads to an in-
creased demand for techni-
cians to go to each house and 
?ll up the tanks, even if the 
tanks were already 90 percent 
?lled. These oil tanks already 
have sensors to determine 
how much the tank is ?lled. 
However, these tanks can now 
be connected to the Inter-
net and have the potential to 
share the amount of oil left in 
the tank and how long it takes 
for the whole tank to be used 
up, which would allow the oil 
company to know which hous-
es need the oil ?rst.
Having connected smart 
devices would improve a lot 
of aspects of life, from simple 
things like getting directions 
from a street lamp to letting 
an oil company know when 
to ?ll up an oil tank. Though 
useful, the Internet of Things 
also brings concern about the 
privacy of the data generated 
by these devices and how they 
are shared. Jones said “there 
is a lot of opt-in” where the 
user is asked to have their data 
shared. But he added that it is 
far “scarier where the govern-
ment comes in, hijacks [our 
data], and uses it to monitor 
us.” 
He also added that busi-
nesses have to be more careful 
in how devices are created. He 
shared an example of how a 
baby monitor was hacked and 
used to wake up a 10-month 
old baby by yelling “Wake up.” 
The hacker was able to get 
that baby monitor’s informa-
tion from Shodan, a search 
engine that indexes publicly 
accessible Internet-connected 
devices.
Having access to already 
available data from our world 
gives us more context and pro-
vides more valuable informa-
tion, which transforms how 
we as humans discover and 
interact in the world.

PUGWASH COLUMNMars trip could be one-way
KATHRYN MCKEOUGH
Special to The Tartan
Elon Musk, chief executive 
of?cer of SpaceX, believes he 
can land humans on Mars by 
2026. Mars One, a nonpro?t 
organization, wants to begin 
establishing a human colony 
on Mars in 2024. But don’t 
start planning your vaca-
tion to Mars just yet. Despite 
SpaceX’s goal to have reus-
able rockets, this feat has not 
yet been proven outside of 
tests. Meanwhile, the Mars 
One mission plans on having 
the colony’s members live 
their lives out on Mars. Now 
that life on Mars appears to 
be feasible within the coming 
decades, what are the con-
sequences of sending people 
on a journey that might be 
one-way?
A manned mission to Mars 
has the potential to be ex-
tremely bene?cial to the prog-
ress of science; it would be a 
litmus test to see how well 
technology can allow humans 
to live in harsh conditions and 
in extreme isolation, far from 
any immediate help. Unfor-
tunately, we cannot rely on 
Earth to host humanity for-
ever. Currently, human be-
havior is forcing Earth into a 
volatile state. There is also the 
chance that a meteor or other 
extraterrestrial disaster could 
destroy the planet. A manned 
mission to Mars could lead 
the way to potential coloniza-
tion on a more massive scale 
— Mars could be the new 
home for humans.
However, the exploration 
and experimentation comes 
with a cost, particularly when 
travelers to Mars are not able 
to return. Pugwash raised the 
concern during its weekly 
meeting that sending humans 
to Mars could be unethical. 
For one, scientists and engi-
neers do not know what to ex-
pect. Landing and setting up 
a successful, inhabitable liv-
ing place on Mars is no small 
feat, and there is the possibil-
ity that a trip to Mars could 
lead to immediate death. One 
Pugwash member even said 
that choosing to live on Mars 
could be similar to choosing 
imminent death, almost like 
euthanasia.
Another concern is wheth-
er or not humans should al-
ter the ecosystem on Mars. 
On Earth, we try to conserve 
many natural phenomena 
through the National Park 
Service. We must consider 
that our occupation of Mars 
would alter or destroy natural 
formations on Mars. We must 
weigh the importance of pre-
serving nature when planning 
the missions to Mars.
In the end, a trip to Mars 
will always be a person’s 
choice. Yet, Pugwash was con-
cerned about whether or not 
humans are informed enough 
to make that decision. It is dif-
?cult to create a completely 
informative and fair consent 
form. Giving people a choice 
could lead to corruption in-
cluding misunderstandings, 
misinformation, and the 
potential of forced consent. 
Some Pugwash members 
were of the mindset that it 
would be wrong to deprive 
a person of travel to Mars if 
they had the capability of do-
ing so and would otherwise 
be a prisoner on Earth. Final-
ly, the group considered the 
possibility of travelers having 
Martian-born children. Do we 
subject these children to grow 
up in such a hazardous atmo-
sphere? Although children 
are born and raised in poor 
conditions on Earth without 
choice, a naturally uninhabit-
able planet adds a new layer 
to the discussion.
In 10–20 years, it is likely 
that the technology to send 
humans to Mars will exist. 
Certain people will be asked 
to make the decision if they 
would like to inhabit another 
planet. Living on Mars has its 
bene?ts in terms of scienti?c 
progress, but we must con-
sider if these unknown living 
conditions are ones we want 
to subject humans to.
Student Pugwash is a non-ad-
vocacy, educational organiza-
tion that discusses the implica-
tions of science. This article is a 
summary of last week’s dicus-
sion on one-way trips to Mars.
HOW THINGS WORKNFC can be active or passive
ADITHYA VENKATESAN
Junior Staffwriter
Apple’s Sept. 9 announce-
ment event has come to a 
close, and the many features 
of the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, 
and Apple Watch are starting 
to sink in. Although many of 
the features, such as a new A8 
chip and the high resolution 
of the new phones’ screens, 
have caused excitement, the 
inclusion of near ?eld com-
munication (NFC) into the 
next generation devices has 
the world abuzz. 
With Apple’s stamp of ap-
proval, many companies are 
starting to look at greater in-
vestments into the payment 
possibilities NFC holds.
So what exactly is near 
?eld communication? As you 
can probably guess, it involves 
interactions between devices 
that are close to each other. 
Closeness usually means a 
few centimeters away from 
another device, although 
some NFC chips necessitate 
contact to transfer or receive 
information.
There are two different 
types of NFC: active and pas-
sive. Active NFC, which is cur-
rently used on many Android 
devices, as well as the new 
Apple devices, can send and 
receive data. One major use 
of NFC is storing and trans-
ferring contact or credit card 
information. With apps such 
as Google Wallet on Android 
phones, you can simply tap 
your device to pay at stores.
Passive NFC, on the other 
hand, can only send data. 
However, passive NFC pro-
vides an extra bene?t: The 
passive devices can run 
without power. You can ?nd 
passive NFC on all sorts of 
devices that need to commu-
nicate with others. For ex-
ample, our student ID cards 
use NFC technology. If you 
tap your card on the bus, your 
card is passively transferring 
information through NFC to 
the bus system’s active card 
reader, which allows the bus 
system to realize that you are 
a Carnegie Mellon student 
and charge the university for 
your trip. Billboards and signs 
can also use NFC. You can 
usually tap one of these with 
a phone to get more informa-
tion about the topic discussed 
on the board.
NFC has many uses, but 
how does it work? According 
to the blog Android Authority, 
NFC is just another wireless 
transmission standard. But 
unlike Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, it is 
able to send information pas-
sively. It does this by using a 
process called electromagnet-
ic induction. When an active 
NFC component comes near a 
passive component, the active 
component’s electromagnetic 
?eld causes small currents to 
?ow through the passive part. 
The generated power allows 
the passive NFC to send data 
whenever the active part is 
nearby. Close proximities al-
low for a stronger electromag-
netic ?eld to affect the NFC, 
which is why most devices 
need to be so close to each 
other to transfer valuable 
information.
NFC has its own trans-
mission frequency of 13.56 
MHz. It also has a speed of 
anywhere from 100 to 450 
kilobits per second. Although 
this means that you can’t 
transfer a full HD movie in a 
feasible amount of time, it is 
fast enough to transfer small 
amounts of data, such as 
contacts. 
The NFC standard has 
three different modes that it 
uses to operate: peer-to-peer, 
read/write, and card emula-
tion. Peer-to-peer allows for 
two active tags to write to 
each other, whereas read/
write is directed toward one 
device. Card emulation, on 
the other hand, allows a de-
vice to function like a pas-
sive device, which is how 
your phone can function as a 
wallet.
Although people argue for 
other data transfer methods, 
NFC provides near-instanta-
neous connection speeds and 
allows devices to transmit 
data passively. In addition, 
new methods such as Android 
Beam use NFC for faster trans-
fer times. As NFC becomes 
more popular, we may even 
see new uses for it.

Learning new skills and ac-
quiring knowledge is essential 
to the growth and develop-
ment of modern society, but 
there is still uncertainty re-
garding the biological mecha-
nisms behind this occurrence. 
Recent ?ndings by re-
searchers at the joint Carn-
egie Mellon and University 
of Pittsburgh Center for the 
Neural Basis of Cognition 
(CNBC) suggest that it is easi-
er to learn new skills if people 
can associate them with skills 
they already have.
The researchers include 
Carnegie Mellon’s Byron 
Yu, an assistant professor of 
electrical and computer en-
gineering and biomedical 
engineering; Steven Chase, 
an assistant professor of bio-
medical engineering with 
a courtesy appointment in 
electrical and computer en-
gineering at Carnegie Mel-
lon and researcher at the 
CNBC; as well as University 
of Pittsburgh researcher Pat-
rick Sadtler, a bioengineering 
Ph.D. candidate. 
The team is also comprised 
of Carnegie Mellon’s Matthew 
Golub, Stanford University’s 
Stephen Ryu, and University 
of Pittsburgh’s Aaron Batista, 
Elizabeth Tyler-Kabara, and 
Kristin Quick.
The team used brain com-
puter interfaces (BCIs) to 
translate neural activity into 
something more easily de-
?ned, Chase explained.
“BCIs take neural activity 
and map it directly to some-
thing else. It’s often a robotic 
arm, but in this case it was a 
computer cursor,” Chase said. 
Animal subjects were trained 
to move a computer cursor to 
targets on a screen while the 
researchers monitored their 
motor cortex, the section of 
the brain responsible for vol-
untary movements.
The movement of the cur-
sor to the target required the 
subjects to produce speci?c 
patterns of neural activity. If 
the subjects were able to ef?-
ciently move the cursor, it sig-
naled that they had produced 
the correct neural activity 
pattern.
“We designed mapping 
between neuron activity and 
cursor movement that would 
either take existing patterns 
in neural activity and use 
them in new ways to drive the 
cursor in different directions 
or generate new patterns of 
neural activity that had nev-
er been used before,” Chase 
said. “The whole goal of the 
experiment was to try to make 
a prediction about what sorts 
of things are learnable and 
what sorts of things are not.”
The research showed that 
certain neural activity pat-
terns were easier than others 
for subjects to learn. Subjects 
generally had an easier time 
learning patterns that were 
comprised of pre-existing 
patterns. Patterns consisting 
of totally new patterns were 
much harder for subjects to 
learn.
“You can change existing 
patterns and map them to 
cursor movement,” explained 
Chase. “What you can’t do is 
generate new patterns — or 
at least you can’t do it very 
quickly.”
The possible applications 
of this research are extensive, 
including improved motor 
learning rehabilitation and 
more ef?cient, functional 
BCIs. Chase explained that 
motor learning is a topic that 
necessitates further study.
“Motor learning is one of 
those big open questions in 
neuroscience research; we re-
ally don’t understand what it 
is and how it occurs,” Chase 
said. 
“We normally don’t think 
about motor control very 
much because we’re extreme-
ly good at it, but when it goes 
wrong it’s devastating.”
Spinal cord injury, stroke, 
and Parkinson’s disease are 
all widespread af?ictions as-
sociated with faulty motor 
control. “Stroke is an instance 
where we hope that we will 
be able to learn to overcome 
whatever de?cits there are. 
It’s a question of learning, and 
if we knew the right way to 
derive the learning, we could 
help people recover from 
strokes better,” Chase said.
He further commented on 
the ability of interdisciplin-
ary collaboration to prompt 
innovation. “This was a true 
collaborative project that 
brought together techniques 
from a bunch of different 
?elds, including neurobiolo-
gy, engineering, and machine 
learning,” Chase said. 
“The end goal of all of 
this research is to really un-
derstand motor learning at a 
fundamental level and take 
that information to perform 
stroke rehabilitation more 
effectively and design bet-
ter BCIs for those who can’t 
communicate.”
The research was funded 
by the National Institutes of 
Health, the National Science 
Foundation, and the Bur-
roughs Wellcome Fund. The 
paper was published in the 
Aug. 28 issue of Nature.

The use of hydraulic fracturing to 
extract natural gas from the Marcel-
lus Shale deposit in Western Pennsyl-
vania has proven to be an extremely 
controversial issue. This controversy 
is poised to intensify with the results 
of a Yale University study concluding 
that residents living close to Marcel-
lus Shale drilling wells in Washing-
ton County, Pa. have more health 
problems than those living farther 
away.
Speci?cally, the study, conducted 
in 2012, found that out of 492 people 
living within half a mile of a shale 
gas site, 39 percent reported upper 
respiratory symptoms, as opposed 
to 18 percent living more than a mile 
away. It should be noted that this 
study only establishes correlation 
between geographic location and 
health outcomes, and does not pro-
vide any insight into direct causes of 
these health problems. 
Regardless, advocacy groups 
against hydraulic fracturing for natu-
ral gas in Western Pennsylvania will 
likely use this evidence in their case 
against gas and drilling companies, 
adding further fuel to a continually 
?ery debate. While there is a debate 
surrounding the use of hydraulic 
fracking to obtain natural gas in the 
Marcellus Region, there is a need for 
academic studies to analyze the ef-
fects of this practice with as great a 
degree of certainty as possible. 
This recent Yale study only sug-
gests a correlation between health 
outcomes and proximity to a frack-
ing well, a relationship that could be 
attributed to socioeconomic status 
or other factors. Uncertainty such 
as this underscores the need for in-
stitutions such as Carnegie Mellon to 
conduct thorough academic analy-
ses of such local issues as hydraulic 
fracturing. 
Particularly with the creation 
of the Wilton E. Scott Institute for 
Energy Innovation, the university 
should continue to focus on studying 
important energy and environmen-
tally-related topics such as hydraulic 
fracturing and their public health 
impacts. 
As our university continues to 
expand, creating new institutes and 
building new buildings, we must also 
remember that academic research 
should be one of our foremost priori-
ties and that local issues deserve our 
attention. 
PA environmental issues need CMU attention
A6 « thetartan.org/forum The Tartan » September 15, 2014
With the walls of the Sherman 
and Joyce Bowie Scott Hall going 
up and continuous discussion of the 
soon-to-be Tepper Quadrangle, it is 
not hard to see that Carnegie Mellon 
is fast-growing and changing from 
the local tech school it started as 114 
years ago. In that time, we have be-
come a world-class institution with 
many achievements in the arts, sci-
ences, and engineering disciplines. 
But as we grow with our recent 
achievements, we need to remember 
that the quantity of buildings, or cen-
ters, or initiatives that we have does 
not make us a quality institution. 
The words “global,” “innovation,” 
and “initiative” seem to have entered 
Carnegie Mellon’s communications 
and stuck. It is a surprise when a 
campus-wide email does not con-
tain one, if not all, of these favorite 
Carnegie terms. Being innovative is 
like having power, but as Margret 
Thatcher once said, “If you have to 
tell people you are, you aren’t.” This 
campus is, of course, full of brilliant 
people with fascinating ideas and 
amazing achievements. But if we 
keep shouting at the world about 
how “innovative” we are then all we 
are bound to receive is a global eye 
roll. 
Instead of setting up new “um-
brella structures” and vague initia-
tives, we should focus on breaking 
down the structures and letting the 
brilliant individuals of this campus 
shine. Their light will be far more im-
pressive then any speech about our 
innovation could ever be.     
The growth of initiatives and 
schools is surely meant with the best 
intentions, but none of these things 
will make us rise in the eyes of our 
peer institutions. Part of what makes 
Carnegie Mellon great is our ability 
to conduct research within a small 
community. No doubt the school 
could use a few more students’ tu-
ition payments, or another profes-
sor’s grant money, but as a communi-
ty we must toe this line carefully. Part 
of our strength comes from being a 
small but mighty research communi-
ty in which people’s paths can cross 
outside o f their home departments. 
As we move forward, we must 
remember the value of integrity and 
dignity in the way we present our-
selves as an institution to the world. 
Our heart must remain in our work, 
and we must only modestly and ac-
curately boast of our innovative 
initiatives when they truly deserve 
promotion.
CMU may make “innovation” a dead buzzword

In a time in American history 
when homicide rates are at their 
lowest in 50 years, it seems inexpli-
cable that anti-gun activism is mul-
tiplying at its current rate. For the 
past two weeks, the Kroger Compa-
ny has been on the receiving end of 
a series of unprovoked attacks made 
by Moms Demand Action (MDA). 
The rapidly growing advocacy 
group against gun violence is cur-
rently engaged in an ad campaign 
against the supermarket franchise’s 
open carry rules in their stores. MDA 
— a still-adolescent organization — 
is proactively persisting in its offen-
sive toward policy change, having 
no grounds or context beyond the 
new American gun-conscious stan-
dard. The store in the spotlight is 
located in Cincinnati, only a 15-min-
ute drive from Kroger’s corporate 
headquarters.
“We are anti-gun violence,” said 
Michelle Mueller, a regional repre-
sentative from MDA, in a statement, 
“and we’ll do whatever it takes ....  
to create a safer environment.” The 
organization, fully named Moms 
Demand Action for Gun Sense in 
America, was formed in December 
2012 in reaction to the Sandy Hook 
Elementary School shooting and 
has been bold in its efforts since its 
conception. 
Its most recent victories in the 
battle against in-store open carry 
include Target and Starbucks. Both 
are stores with no history of gun vio-
lence. Already, the group claims that 
100,000 people have signed its peti-
tion to prohibit open carry in Kroger 
supermarkets.
The in?ated ad campaign aimed 
at Kroger began on Aug. 18 and was 
revitalized on Sept. 4, now focused 
not only on stores located in states 
with laws permitting open carry, but 
nationwide. The unnecessary MDA 
ads have been displayed in newspa-
pers and billboards throughout the 
Cincinnati area, displaying people 
carrying long guns next to people 
eating food or skateboarding with 
the caption “One of Them Isn’t Wel-
come at Kroger. Guess Which One.” 
These ads reveal the super?ciality 
in MDA’s grasp of the compromise 
in public safety caused by the open 
carrying of ?rearms.
Despite a wave of media in op-
position to Kroger — including the 
hashtag #GroceriesNotGuns — few 
spokespeople from the company 
have commented on MDA’s actions, 
except by referring to a previously 
released company statement, assert-
ing that the safety of the customers 
and associates is possible while not 
infringing on the rights of citizens 
who choose to carry. “We know 
that our customers are passionate 
on both sides of this issue and we 
trust them to be responsible in our 
stores,” the statement reads.
Despite the lack of response from 
the company under ?re, MDA lead-
ers continue to speak out and have 
deservedly started to land in hot 
water for it. The aforementioned 
MDA representative has stated that 
at least 16 shooting deaths have oc-
curred at or surrounding Kroger 
locations; however, she has yet to 
provide any evidence backing this 
claim. 
The MDA also has no member-
ship revenue, instead funding its 
political momentum with a $50 
million donation from former New 
York City mayor Michael Bloom-
berg. While sound in mission, the 
organization seems to lack effective 
leadership and policy, epitomized in 
the group’s tendency to fudge atten-
dance numbers in their support ral-
lies since April.
Kroger is ?rm in its position of 
defending the right of its customers 
to carry guns in its stores. The push 
to limit ?rearms in public places, es-
pecially those serving families and 
children, is understandable in our 
current gun-reactionary society, 
but it may not be successful if spear-
headed by an organization with 
leadership like MDA’s. 
Though Moms Demand Action 
has a great track record for changing 
the open carry policy of companies 
with formidable national presences, 
Kroger may be justi?ed in refusing 
to compromise with a group that has 
yet to prove it deserves its growing 
social and political in?uence.
MDA oversteps bounds with its Kroger campaign

#WhyIStayed has been trending on 
Twitter for the past week as a unique 
and effective tool to subvert the usual 
conversation surrounding domestic 
violence. 
Ostensibly, #WhyIStayed is a re-
sponse to the leaked video of former 
NFL star Ray Rice beating Janay Rice, 
his then-?ancee and current wife, in a 
hotel elevator, according to CNN. But 
the trend also engages with society’s 
tendency of blaming the victim in dis-
cussions of domestic violence. This 
engagement is a vital step toward alle-
viating the intense shame often heaped 
upon victims of domestic violence.
When the video ?rst leaked, ques-
tions arose as to why Janay Rice did not 
choose to leave her partner, as opposed 
to why Ray Rice beat his partner in the 
?rst place. This is typical of domestic 
violence discussions. Rather than ques-
tion the motives and behaviors of the 
abuser, people sometimes question 
why anyone would allow someone else 
to hit her. This choice pushes the shame 
of being abused away from the abuser 
and onto the victim. 
People who ask questions like “Why 
didn’t Janay leave Ray?” do not under-
stand the truly corrosive effects of do-
mestic violence, or how much danger 
women who are abused by a partner 
are in. According to DomesticAbuse-
Shelter.org, battering is the single 
largest cause of injury to women, and 
around 4,000 women in America die 
per year due to domestic violence. Ap-
proximately 75 percent of those wom-
en are killed when they try to leave an 
abusive relationship or after they had 
already left it. 
#WhyIStayed allows people who 
have suffered domestic abuse to discuss 
their experiences and subvert victim-
blaming. Beverly Gooden, who created 
the hashtag, shared some of her own 
heart-rending experiences, such as “I 
stayed because I was halfway across 
the country, isolated from my friends 
and family. And there was no one to 
help me,” and “I tried to leave the house 
once after an abusive episode, and he 
blocked me. He slept in front of the 
door that entire night.”
#WhyIStayed is an excellent and 
necessary way to pivot the conversation 
surrounding domestic violence away 
from victim-blaming. People who suf-
fer from domestic violence need help 
and support, and this trend, through 
raising awareness, is an effective tool 
for providing that. 
#WhyIStayed empowers domestic abuse victims

This Thursday, Scotland will vote 
on whether to become an indepen-
dent country. This is not the ?rst time 
such a referendum has occurred, but 
it seems to be the ?rst time that it has 
a chance of passing.
 Recent polls show a near 50–50 
split among Scottish voters. If the 
measure passes, Scotland would sep-
arate from the United Kingdom (UK), 
thus breaking a union with England, 
Wales, and Northern Ireland that has 
existed since 1707.
United States media coverage has 
been scant, but the consequences 
could be signi?cant either way. An 
independent Scotland would need to 
apply to the European Union (EU), 
and the new United Kingdom would 
be signi?cantly weaker as an econom-
ic power. The Economist warns that 
this would weaken the EU as a whole, 
since the UK is already promoting a 
referendum to leave the EU itself.
If Scotland were to become a sov-
ereign nation, there would be an im-
mediate currency issue since it cur-
rently uses the British pound. Most 
EU countries use the euro, but Scot-
land would generally have to be ap-
proved for EU membership before it 
could start using the euro. 
Leaders from the “Yes Scotland” 
campaign say that an independent 
Scotland would continue using the 
pound, but foreign investors worry 
that without support from the UK the 
Scottish pound would lack ?nancial 
backing.
In terms of representation, an in-
dependent Scotland would have its 
own governing body. Scotland votes 
consistently more liberally than the 
rest of the UK, so it would be able to 
represent its people with more au-
thority, instead of being con?ned to 
a liberal minority of the UK Parlia-
ment. Scotland would also make 
domestic decisions independently. 
For example, Scots generally oppose 
nuclear weapons, but the UK stores its 
nuclear weapons in Scottish lochs. An 
independent Scotland would likely 
become an anti-nuclear state.
Even if the referendum falls short, 
the British will have to revisit their 
relations with Scotland. Issues such 
as national defense and economic 
security will have to be brought into 
question if the countries remain 
united, but Scotland will probably 
get more autonomy within the United 
Kingdom. 
No matter which way the vote 
goes, the result of the Scottish refer-
endum will set a precedent for the 
rest of Europe. Other semi-auton-
omous regions — the Catalan and 
Basque regions of Spain, the Flemish 
regions of Belgium — have unsuc-
cessfully attempted to break away 
before. If Scotland succeeds now, we 
may see a new precedent for Euro-
pean independence.
Independent Scotland will affect EU

Campaigning takes up a lot of 
political of?cials’ time and money. 
Maybe it takes up too much. The 
process of re-election appears to be 
the main focus of political of?cials to 
the extent that they will strategically 
choose to avoid making any major 
decisions.
On Sept. 6, President Barack 
Obama announced that he plans to 
put off action on immigration issues 
until after the midterm elections, 
claiming that the decision was the 
result of this summer’s surge of un-
documented children crossing the 
United States border from Mexico. 
However, Obama’s decision appears 
to be more of a response to Demo-
crats in tough Senate races, who 
were concerned that taking action 
on immigration would affect their 
campaigns.
Before Obama’s address, action 
was expected to take place on immi-
gration by the end of the summer to 
reduce the number of deportations 
and possibly to offer work permits 
to people living in the United States 
illegally. 
Obama promised that he would 
act by the end of the summer to 
address the many problems of the 
immigration system. Now, White 
House of?cials claim that Obama 
will act by the end of the year. What 
does this mean for the hundreds of 
families who fear deportation and 
the separation of their families?
President Obama broke a prom-
ise to immigrants, their families, 
and their allies. Obama raised the 
hopes of many when he promised to 
take up comprehensive immigration 
reform during his ?rst year in of?ce. 
Six years later, many families are 
having to live with the fear of depor-
tation as a result of Obama’s delay 
until after the November elections. 
In addition, the administration’s 
deportation numbers beat all previ-
ous records, with Obama deporting 
more than two million immigrants 
in his almost eight-year tenure. As 
a result, advocates for immigration 
reform have commonly referred to 
Obama as “deporter-in-chief.”
This is very unfortunate because 
it shows how dif?cult it is to take ac-
tion in the United States’ political 
system. One ?aw of the system is 
the frequency of elections. Political 
of?cials spend more time focusing 
on getting re-elected than taking ac-
tion, especially regarding controver-
sial issues. Making major decisions 
is simply not something political 
of?cials will do during campaign 
season.
Recently, Senate Democrats run-
ning in conservative states have not 
had the best of luck, as GOP oppo-
nents use the subject of immigration 
to attack their campaigns. To activ-
ist groups, such as America’s Voice, 
Obama’s decision to stall action 
was an obvious political move and a 
blunder.
Having waited for months for 
Obama to take action on the issue, 
disappointed immigrants and their 
allies are now forced to wait longer. 
President Obama must stop making 
false promises and ful?ll the hopes 
he once raised for signi?cant immi-
gration reform.
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
We, a group of current Carnegie 
Mellon students and recent alumni, 
are writing to express our concerns 
over a recent document that was 
sent out to the campus community. 
On Friday afternoon, Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Gina Casalegno sent 
an email titled “Preventing and Re-
sponding to Sexual Harassment and 
Violence.” 
In this email, she outlines the 
changes and initiatives that Carn-
egie Mellon has taken since last Sep-
tember to improve its handlings of 
sexual assault on campus—changes 
which are necessary, considering 
that the Of?ce of Civil Rights in the 
Department of Education is cur-
rently investigating Carnegie Mel-
lon for its alleged failure to protect 
students’ Title IX rights in regard to 
sexual assault.
 Within this email, Casalegno in-
cluded a link to a publication that 
the university developed titled “De-
cisions that Matter,” and touted this 
publication as an example of the 
university’s “principle initiatives” 
in combating sexual violence on 
campus. 
We ?nd it very troubling, how-
ever, that a document about sexual 
violence called “Decisions that Mat-
ter” seems more focused on a vic-
tim’s decisions leading up to an as-
sault than it does on telling students 
to make the decision not to rape 
someone.
 It includes a page on “Risk Re-
duction of Sexual Assault,” which 
lists speci?c actions students should 
take to avoid being assaulted, in-
cluding “Taking CMU’s R.A.D. [Rape 
Aggression Defense] self-defense 
class,” and “Keeping the doors to 
your home locked at all times.” 
These “tips” reinforce the idea that 
most rapes on college campuses 
are caused by strangers who attack 
you on the street or break into your 
home. 
However, in 75-80 percent of 
campus rape cases, a woman’s at-
tacker is an acquaintance, class-
mate, friend, or (ex)boyfriend, ac-
cording to the White House’s “Not 
Alone” report. Other tips include 
“Avoiding making sexual decisions 
while you are intoxicated,” implying 
that alcohol-facilitated rape is a “de-
cision” that a victim makes.
 These tips come with an aster-
isked aside that says these tips “can-
not eliminate the chance for sexual 
assault,” but they still are putting 
the onus on (presumably) women to 
prevent someone else’s crime. More 
disturbingly, when you tell a woman 
that she must restrict her behavior 
in order to avoid being raped, what 
you’re really saying is that a woman 
should ensure that a rapist goes af-
ter someone else—and how does 
that help to make Carnegie Mellon 
an ultimately safer community?
 This document also includes 
vague “Pathways to Being an Active 
Bystander,” but that list doesn’t pro-
vide advice that is anywhere near 
as pointed or detailed as the “Risk 
Reduction” tips. This approach is 
entirely backward, as bystander in-
tervention — and speci?cally, call-
ing out men to engage as allies — 
has been cited by the White House 
Task Force to Protect Students from 
Sexual Assault as one of “the most 
promising prevention strategies.”
 It is somewhat mind-boggling 
that a publication called “Decisions 
that Matter” that’s about sexual as-
sault doesn’t focus entirely on the 
importance of getting consent in 
sexual interactions and on the con-
sequences that will follow when a 
rapist decides to commit a crime. 
Even the page that lists Pennsylva-
nia’s legal de?nition of rape isn’t 
thorough: It prominently features 
the phrase “forcible” compulsion, 
which is a term that carries certain 
legal connotations that Pennsylva-
nia law has actually evolved beyond.
 CMU’s initiatives may be well-
intentioned — in fact, its ?rst-year 
education program Haven, which 
Casalegno also cites in her email, 
actually includes information that 
is far more effective in preventing 
sexual assault. 
However, Haven was only added 
to Orientation this year, meaning 
that the vast majority of the col-
lege campus is getting its education 
through misguided documents like 
“Decisions that Matter.” We suggest 
that those who want to learn more 
about proven methods of reducing 
sexual assault view resources on 
notalone.gov; students who want to 
learn more about their rights under 
Title IX to an education free of sexu-
al assault or harassment should visit 
knowyourix.org.

Obama must stop stalling  
real immigration reform
BRANDON SCHMUCK 
Last week, Apple held its annual 
iPhone unveiling event in one of its 
most symbolic venues: the Flint Cen-
ter for the Performing Arts. This lo-
cation is where both the original Ma-
cintosh and the iMac, which brought 
forth Apple’s rebirth, were unveiled. 
As Apple took the stage, many won-
dered — after nearly three years 
without Steve Jobs — would its re-
turn to this venue mark yet another 
rebirth or, instead, a decline?
Apple’s event was another suc-
cessful one, revolving around the 
new iPhone 6 models and the Apple 
Watch. With both of these devices, 
Apple has continued its trend of 
paying exceptional attention to de-
tail. This attention can be seen ev-
erywhere from the way the glass 
screen of the new iPhone ?ows into 
its aluminum chassis to the new user 
interface controls accompanying the 
Apple Watch. 
However, while Apple’s atten-
tion to design has continued past the 
death of Jobs, one important thing 
has changed. Historically recognized 
as an industry leader, Apple is now 
becoming more and more of an in-
dustry follower.
Apple is very late in entering the 
industry with near ?eld communi-
cations (NFC), smartwatches, and 
enlarged screens. Google has long 
offered these features to its users. 
However, has Apple ever been the 
?rst to enter an industry? As was 
the case in the years of Jobs, Apple 
is often a latecomer to most of the 
industries it enters. However, it has 
almost always managed to choose a 
slow-growth industry and turn it into 
something enormous.
.
“ While the new 
Apple has greatly 
changed, as it 
stated during the 
opening of the 
keynote: ‘Different 
is the one thing 
about us that will 
always be the 
same.’ ”
Take the smartwatch industry. 
Smartwatches are not exactly new. 
The Pebble has been around for 
over a year. However, in that year, 
Pebble only managed to sell around 
400,000 units since January 2013. 
Compare this to the nine million 
iPhone 5S units Apple sold within 
three days of its launch. It is evident 
that Apple may sell more watches on 
its release day than Pebble has dur-
ing its lifetime. The reason the new 
Apple Watch will be more popular is 
not because of its specs, nor because 
people actually need another screen 
on their wrist. It is because instead 
of focusing on bragging about the 
specs, Apple focuses on people. Half 
of its keynote emphasized everyday 
people using its devices to make 
their lives easier.
The new Apple may not be churn-
ing out as many ideas that have nev-
er been seen before. In a time of ma-
turing mobile industries, it may be 
?nally admitting defeat and making 
some decisions that it would have 
never made before, like the iPhone 
6’s enormous ?ve and a half inch 
screen. However, in many ways, the 
reborn Apple is still the old Apple.
Only the new Apple would have 
admitted defeat and enlarged its 
screens while focusing solely on 
making it operable with one hand. 
Only the new Apple would be able 
to think up something like the digital 
crown, a new twist on the old device 
found on every analog watch. 
Only the new Apple would have 
been able to enter an industry as 
a follower but come out a leader. 
While the new Apple has changed 
greatly, as it stated during the open-
ing of the keynote: “Different is the 
one thing about us that will always 
be the same.”

SPORTS BRIEFS
Women’s Volleyball
The Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity volleyball team had 
a busy week, playing three 
games. They hosted Saint Vin-
cent College on Tuesday and 
breezed to any easy straight 
set victory. Carnegie Mellon 
won the ?rst set 25–21 and 
dominated the second set 
25–14. The Bearcats made it a 
contest in the third set, keep-
ing it close until the very end 
when Carnegie Mellon pulled 
out the 25–22 set win. First-
year outside hitter Heather 
Holton led the Tartans with 10 
kills in the match, followed by 
senior right setter Ali Celen-
tano, who had nine kills.
On Saturday, the Tartans 
played two matches at the 
Bethany College Quad. Unfor-
tunately, Carnegie Mellon had 
an off day and lost their ?rst 
two matches of the season. 
The Tartans lost both matches 
in straight sets 3–0. In the ?rst 
match against Thomas More 
College, the team came out 
slow dropping the ?rst two 
sets 25–14 and 25–12 before 
putting up a ?ght in the third 
set, only to lose 25–21.
In the second game of the 
double header against Beth-
any, the Tartans looked less 
like the undefeated team they 
were becoming, losing 25–22 
and 25–23 in the ?rst two sets 
and pushing the third set into 
tiebreak points before falling 
27–25.
Sophomore middle 
blocker/outside hitter Casey 
Salandra’s 10 kills were one of 
the few high points for the Tar-
tans in the second game along 
with sophomore defensive set-
ter Molly Higgins’s 21 digs.
The Tartans will play again 
next Wednesday when they 
travel to Marietta College.
Men’s and Women’s Cross 
Country
On Friday, the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s and women’s 
cross country teams competed 
at the Slippery Rock Univer-
sity Invitational, with each 
squad placing second.
Senior George Degen led 
the men with his third place 
?nish in a time of 26:15.03, 
followed up closely by sopho-
more Ryan Archer in fourth 
place, crossing the line at the 
26:34.91 minute mark.
The next ?ve runners for 
the Tartans ?nished in a bunch 
among the top 12 with senior 
Joshua Antonson, ?rst-year 
Ryan Auld, junior Marc-Dan-
iel Julien, sophomore Curtis 
Watro, and junior Brian Bol-
lens ?nishing eighth, ninth, 
10th, 11th, and 12th respec-
tively, all of them crossing the 
line between 26:56.86 and 
27:18.17.
On the women’s side, ju-
nior Elizabeth Snyder placed 
second overall with a time of 
22:57.88.
In a similar fashion to the 
men’s team, the next set of 
runners was clumped togeth-
er, this time between 13th 
and 19th place with random 
Slippery Rock and Mans?eld 
University of Pennsylvania 
runners caught in the middle. 
Junior Taylor Maggiacomo, 
senior Erin Kiekhaefer, ju-
nior Priya Patel, senior Hai-
ley Brown, and junior Haley 
Bryant all ?nished between 
24:26.23 and 24:44.01 in the 
listed order.
Both Tartan teams race 
next Saturday at Dickinson 
College.
Women’s Golf
The inaugural season for 
the Carnegie Mellon women’s 
golf team had another ?rst on 
Tuesday as the team won its 
?rst ever tournament as an of-
?cial NCAA team.
Playing at the Grove City 
College Women’s Golf Fall 
Invitational, ?rst-years Sum-
mer Kitahara and Robin Tan 
took ?rst and second overall, 
shooting 79 and 80, respec-
tively. Fellow ?rst-years Emma 
Hoskins and Isabelle Tseng 
rounded out the team, placing 
sixth and 19th while shooting 
86 and 100, respectively.
On Saturday, the Tartans 
won their second straight 
tournament, winning the 
Thiel College Invitational with 
a combined team score of 341.
Once again Kitahara and 
Tan took ?rst and second over-
all, this time with a 77 for Ki-
tahara and another 80 for Tan. 
Hoskins shot a 88 this time, 
and ?rst-year Diana Zhou 
played as part of the team 
after entering the previous 
tournament as an individual, 
shooting a 96.
Carnegie Mellon will next 
tee off Tuesday at the Saint 
Vincent Invitational.
Men’s Golf
On Sunday and Monday of 
last week, the Carnegie Mel-
lon men’s golf team competed 
in the Hal Hansen Invitational.
The Tartans placed sixth 
overall on the 72 course, 
shooting a 298 on the ?rst day 
and a 309 on the second for a 
combined 607.
Senior Justin Fischler 
placed the highest individu-
ally, with a seventh place ?n-
ish and a 148 between the 
two days. Senior Cameron 
Low and sophomore Jordan 
Klodowski tied for 16th with a 
151. Sophomore George Qian 
rounded out the scoring team 
with a 158 across the two days.
The Tartans started com-
peting on Sunday in the Guy 
W. Kuhn Invitational, ?nishing 
up the two-day tournament on 
Monday.

Men’s soccer grabs a win

Two goals on either end of 
the half pushed Carnegie Mel-
lon men’s soccer to an impres-
sive 3–0 win over Allegheny 
College on Saturday to pull 
their record for the season to 
an even 3–3. 
The score misrepresents a 
game that felt close through-
out, and the shot count was 
nearly even. Carnegie Mel-
lon was generating far better 
chances, though, and the Al-
legheny keeper was consis-
tently working, while Allegh-
eny only managed two shots 
within the frame.
Carnegie Mellon’s ?rst 
close call came midway 
through the second half as ju-
nior mid?elder Connor Webb 
put a shot off the goalpost. 
Carnegie Mellon’s pres-
sure on the goal ?nally paid 
off as the half drew to a close 
when sophomore mid?elder 
Devin Keane’s free kick led 
to some confusion in the box. 
Though the shot was unsuc-
cessful, the team managed 
to turn it around to work for 
them.
Freshman forward Ryan 
Stinebaugh caused an Alegh-
eny defender to panic and de-
?ect the ball into his own net. 
The goal capped off a solid 
half from Carnegie Mellon 
where Allegheny was unable 
to generate much pressure on 
Carnegie Mellon’s net.
The second half started 
quickly for Carnegie Mel-
lon as Webb’s shot just two 
minutes into the half was 
saved but not secured, and 
Stinebaugh drove home the 
rebound to open up some 
breathing room. 
With the half drawing to a 
close, Webb sealed the game 
after receiving a ball from 
senior defenseman Jakob Ro-
hwer and setting himself up 
for Carnegie Mellon’s third 
goal of the afternoon. 
The pressure put on by 
Allegheny in the second half 
was turned away by two ex-
cellent saves from junior goal-
keeper Eric Bykowsky to keep 
a clean sheet in the match. 
None of the 10 shots that 
were made by the team suc-
ceeded.
Overall, the Allegheny 
team committed 18 fouls on 
the ?eld, while Carnegie Mel-
lon checked in with only 11.
Carnegie Mellon’s season 
continues when Washington 
and Jefferson College comes 
to Pittsburgh on Wednesday 
evening. The game will begin 
at 7:00 p.m.
to defend Rice from his two-
game suspension, and the 
message was loud and clear. 
NFL: Not For Ladies. 
Many who populate online 
NFL forums determined that, 
by being near a football play-
er, a woman was subjecting 
herself to the violent fanta-
sies of NFL fans and her mere 
existence in the center of this 
—which was entirely not her 
fault or what she wanted — 
made her an enemy of man-
liness in American culture, 
depicted in the boundless vio-
lence of the NFL.
This is not even the ?rst 
time this happened. Decades 
ago, Cleveland Browns run-
ning back Jim Brown, a very 
charismatic and popular play-
er like Ray Rice, was accused 
of sexual assault, and later 
of throwing a woman from a 
balcony. The NFL defended 
him, and they have defended 
employees who have commit-
ted violent acts against wom-
en ever since. The unsettling 
precedent shows just how 
deep this problem runs in the 
NFL.
As previously mentioned, 
the more complete and dis-
turbing images of Rice have 
forced the NFL’s hand. The 
NFL has instituted a new and 
somewhat harsher domestic 
violence policy, but the dam-
age has been done. 
The NFL proved it was only 
willing to act on domestic vio-
lence when it became a major 
national story. 
A loud subset of fans 
proved that violence — not 
athletic prowess — is at the 
heart of America’s love for 
football and that such a cul-
ture lends itself to bitter 
misogyny.
Carolina Panthers’ de-
fensive end Greg Hardy was 
convicted of throwing his 
girlfriend on a pile of guns 
while threatening to kill her. 
San Francisco 49ers’ defen-
sive end Ray McDonald was 
recently arrested for domes-
tic violence. Hardy is playing 
while his appeal is reviewed. 
McDonald is playing until his 
trial occurs.
This problem is only com-
ing to light now, but it’s clear-
ly not going away any time 
soon. I’m not sure how much 
longer I can keep supporting 
this league’s product.
NFL’s policies are questioned
RICE, from A10
SPORTS COMMENTARY

SPORTS COMMENTARY
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Staffwriter
Over the past few weeks, 
the NFL has revealed how 
truly out of touch the league 
of?ce is with the world out-
side of football. NFL Commis-
sioner Roger Goodell went on 
a rampage of four-game PED 
suspensions, taking a quarter 
of a season away from around 
20 players who may have 
been trying to gain a physical 
edge in an extremely physical 
sport. 2013’s breakout star, 
Cleveland Browns’ wide re-
ceiver Josh Gordon received a 
full season suspension for fail-
ing a marijuana test so nar-
rowly that military guidelines 
would have let him walk.
Yet, of the 38 players sus-
pended, the shortest suspen-
sion somehow belonged to 
Baltimore Ravens running 
back, Ray Rice, who was 
caught on video dragging his 
then-?ancée’s unconscious 
body from a casino elevator in 
Atlantic City.
On Monday, after a new, 
disturbing video was released 
on TMZ and subsequently 
played on an endless loop on 
ESPN, MSNBC, and other net-
works who have no problem 
exploiting this situation for 
viewers, the NFL suspended 
Ray Rice inde?nitely and his 
contract with the Baltimore 
Ravens was terminated. 
However, the league’s de-
layed drop of the hammer 
masks a far more disturbing 
timeline.
The release of the ?rst vid-
eo was regarded with wide-
spread and justi?ed outrage. 
The league has a history of 
protecting domestic abusers 
on the grounds that they did 
not have enough evidence to 
make a decision. 
But this was clear, visible 
proof that a player had physi-
cally assaulted a woman in 
public. 
The NFL would have to 
act swiftly and forcefully and 
send the message that the 
NFL does not stand for vio-
lence against women.
After weeks of waiting on 
litigation to run its course, the 
NFL’s initial judgment was 
that a two-game suspension 
was appropriate. 
Everyone watching was 
in shock. Many, including 
ESPN’s Keith Olbermann, 
claimed Goodell should re-
sign after the embarrassingly 
weak response.
A large portion of football’s 
fan base, on the other hand, 
had the opposite reaction.
A look at the comments on 
ESPN articles and online foot-
ball forums reveal that many 
in the football community 
were appalled that the league 
acted at all. 
A subset of football fans 
lamented the emasculation 
of society and wondered what 
they had left once football 
was taken away.
Football has always been 
regarded as something of a 
violent fantasy land, where 
super humans in helmets de-
stroy each other and manifest 
systems of physical domi-
nance, and the heroes are the 
“manliest,” those who impose 
themselves with the most 
force and brutality. 
For football to condemn 
violence against women, 
for many fans, was the last 
bastion of male power and 
unadulterated aggression ?-
nally softening up under the 
weight of the political correct-
ness movement. Worse, they 
blamed Rice’s then-?ancée 
for provoking him and caus-
ing him to lose games and, as 
a result, money.
This mentality is terrify-
ing. As much as people love 
the old cliché that it’s “just a 
game,” the NFL is a viewing 
experience in which we get 
to see the personal decisions 
each individual makes and 
the extreme rami?cations 
that each choice has. 
A momentary lapse or 
mistake could be worth mil-
lions of dollars for a player, or 
at an emotional level, could 
make a player feel publicly 
humiliated. 
The fact that fans brush 
football off as just a game and 
desire for players to be given 
either more or less freedom 
than any other American citi-
zen reveals a very unsettling 
culture among football fans. 
Brian Phillips, a staffwriter 
for the blog Grantland, wrote 
an excellent article about that 
particular point. 
This becomes even scarier 
when fans want the people 
around NFL players to suffer 
as well.
These are real people who 
do not live in an alternate uni-
verse where imposing pain on 
other humans is a good thing. 
Rice viciously assaulted his 
then-?ancée and now, thanks 
to the TMZ video, everyone 
has seen the haunting inci-
dent with their own eyes.

On Friday, the women’s 
Carnegie Mellon soccer team 
hosted Washington & Jeffer-
son College and continued 
their undefeated season with 
a 6–2 scoring explosion. The 
goal outburst began with se-
nior forward Savina Reid scor-
ing her sixth goal through the 
?rst ?ve games of the team’s 
season in the 21st minute on 
an assist by junior forward Alli 
McGugan. 
Senior mid?elder Jordyn 
Greenberg quickly put the Tar-
tans up by two with her goal 
in the 28th minute. Greenberg 
tipped a header in off of the 
post and turned the miss by 
?rst-year mid?elder Tori Iat-
arola into a goal for Carnegie 
Mellon. Just before halftime, 
the Tartans extended the lead 
once again, this time with 
?rst-year mid?elder Morgan 
Kontor ?nding the back of the 
net on a shot within the 18, 
following assists by ?rst-year 
forward Grant Wilmer and 
Greenberg.
Coming out of halftime, 
the Tartans played even hot-
ter than before, scoring two 
more goals within the ?rst 
eight minutes coming out of 
the half. The ?rst goal came 
in the 49th minute with Reid’s 
second goal of the game, this 
time on a header off of a cross 
by sophomore forward Megan 
Bartoshuk. Then in the 53rd 
minute, the Tartans went up 
by a commanding 5–0 lead on 
a near perfect reversal of the 
previous goal, with Bartoshuk 
scoring off of a cross into the 
box by Reid.
After managing only one 
shot on goal through the ?rst 
half, Washington & Jefferson 
started pushing back as the 
Tartans rested their starters 
and took their foot off the ped-
al. They scored two goals over 
a 10-minute span between the 
60th and 70th minute as they 
continually pushed the Carn-
egie Mellon defense with long 
balls and aggressive play.
With the lead cut to 5–2, 
sophomore mid?elder and 
defender Delanely Lam scored 
the ?nal goal in the 71st min-
ute on a direct free kick into 
the top center of the net.
The Tartans also played at 
Capital on Sunday afternoon 
and continued their streak, 
winning 1–0.

VIA Festival must-see acts
If you only see four things at VIA, let them be these
The VIA Festival is returning to Pittsburgh on Oct. 
1–5, and it’s a pretty big deal. The event, which 
will be expanding to include events in Chicago this 
year, is one of the highlights of Pittsburgh’s cultural 
calendar and touts some of the most celebrated acts 
in independent music.
Spread out at different venues around the city, 
VIA is sure to get you hitting many of Pittsburgh’s 
greatest venues, cinemas, and more — maybe even 
the one and only Carnegie Mellon. Here are a few 
key artists and events that will prove that the cost of 
an all-access pass is totally worth it.
Real Estate
Oct. 1
Location: Altar Bar
As someone who grew up in New Jersey — actually 
in the next town over from the band members — I 
can attest that indie-surf band Real Estate sounds 
exactly like how it feels to grow up in Jersey. The 
guitars are dreamy and wistful, the rhythm section 
bounces along calmly and loosely, and the vocals 
wander off like a chain of thoughts while relaxing in 
a deck chair on a May afternoon.
Real Estate is an act not to be missed by fans of 
live indie music. With all confident players, the 
band’s songs sound as tight as they do on the 
record. If you’re standing in the crowd, just try 
closing your eyes and see if you don’t immediately 
feel transported back to those days when you were 
a teenager and you’d just gotten your license and 
you spent the entire afternoon driving around the 
neighborhood aimlessly only because you could. 
Real Estate has a way of doing that to people.
Diode Milliampere
Oct. 3 & 4
Location: Carnegie Mellon, TBA
Some people — and it must be awful to live inside 
such a narrow mind — believe that music can only 
be made with the types of instruments that have 
been available to humans for thousands of years. 
There are others, however, that believe that music’s 
definition doesn’t lie in its means, but rather in 
something else. Diode Milliampere is a perfect 
example of the latter.
Using outdated computer equipment and an 
MS-DOS (the Microsoft precursor to the Windows 
operating system) application called Adlib Tracker 
II, Milliampere is one of the rising stars of the 
chiptune scene. Given his ancient (at least in 
terms of a technological timeline) and digital 
methods, Milliampere’s music has a surprising 
amount of heart. Videos on his YouTube channel 
— including one of his ambient yet club-happy 
track “Aquarius” — give a peek into his unique 
songwriting process.
He will be giving a lecture discussing his work 
and methodology on Carnegie Mellon’s campus on 
Friday, Oct. 3 and performing on Saturday, Oct. 4.
Cakes Da Killa
Oct. 4
Location: TBA
There are very few musical genres — dance and 
disco really being the only exceptions — that 
historically have been welcoming toward the 
LGBTQ community, and rap is certainly near the top 
of the list of offenders. That homophobia, thankfully, 
is beginning to lose its grip, and many of the most 
talented noisemakers in rap today have come up 
through the LGBTQ community. Cakes Da Killa, 
with his fierce personality, is certainly one of the 
most gripping faces of this emerging community.
Over EDM-inspired beats, Cakes Da Killa (Rashard 
Bradshaw) spits fast and furious rhymes with a 
large personality. Recent releases “You Ain’t Kno?” 
and “Naptime” feature booming 808 trap, while the 
older (five months) “I Run This Club” has the kind 
of throbbing bass that would be right at home in a 
Miami nightclub.
Known for his wild and energetic performances, 
Cakes Da Killa is definitely a face at VIA that isn’t to 
be missed. He will be performing on Saturday, Oct. 4.
Undervolt & Co.
Oct. 4
Location: TBA
In addition to music, VIA will also feature visual art-
ists. Of the many available, the big pop-up event on 
Saturday, Oct. 4 will be curated by Undervolt & Co., 
a label for experimental video artists. There will be a 
group lecture given at Carnegie Mellon followed by 
live visuals from Pittsburgh-based Undervolt 
artists Yoshi Sodeoka, Johnny Woods, MSHR, 
Sabrina Ratte, and JJ Stratford.
Check out the Undervolt website, undervolt.co, to 
get a sense of the kind of psychedelic-inspired videos 
created by the artists on the label.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
My interp teacher just 
gave me a D on my first 
essay, and asked me to 
redo the whole thing, but 
I dont see the point. Im in 
business, and its not like 
Im going to be writing to 
people any way, as long 
as I can talk well and 
do business, Ill be fine. 
What is event the point of 
making nonwriting based 
majors take a writing 
class? I just dont see the 
the point.

Dear NEEDS AN EDITOR,
I’m sorry — I couldn’t hear 
you the first time. Can you 
see the the sic point of 
taking Interpretation and 
Argument? Oh, you can’t? 
Good to know.
I would put this in terms that 
you would understand, but 
frankly, I don’t want to waste 
time and energy on trying 
to figure out what you could 
or couldn’t comprehend. I 
know, harsh, but eh.
If I were to guess your age 
based on the quality of your 
writing, I would say you 
were an 8-year-old — a lazy, 
whining 8-year-old. And if 
you write like an 8-year-old 
in the job market — any job 
market — you may as well 
file for unemployment. This 
applies to emails, résumés, 
grant proposals, post-it 
notes, writings on the walls 
of restroom stalls: If you 
can’t get anywhere close 
to being cogent, clear, and 
consistent in your writing, 
and if you can’t make a 
cohesive argument, then 
you’re screwed.
The reason why you and 
many other first-years with 
similar disabilities (often in 
STEM disciplines) have to 
take Interp is to make you 
realize that fact, and to help 
you organize an argument. 
Unfortunately, most Interp 
professors are so caught up 
in their respective subjects 
that they lose sight of this 
goal, but they can still smell 
sorry excuses for the English 
language from miles away.
So, now you know. Your 
writing sucks. It’s difficult to 
get better, but work on it. It’ll 
be good for you.
Or just work a 9-to-5,
Evan

Think you know the function of everyday objects like 
dressers, ?yswatters, and taxidermy ducks? Think again 
— or, rather, look again.
The Carnegie Museum of Art’s latest exhibition, 
Sebastian Errazuriz: Look Again, invites visitors to 
re-imagine the way they think about the function and 
construction of objects they interact with daily.
The exhibit, which opened on Sept. 6 and is located in 
the Forum Gallery near the museum’s entrance and the 
Hall of Architecture, is an exercise in training the mind 
to assign new meaning or give multiple uses to items 
that people usually take for granted. The sole artist of the 
exhibit, Sebastian Errazuriz, asks visitors to challenge 
their expectations of the seemingly mundane in an 
unusual, yet exciting, collection of furniture installations 
and display pieces:
Magistral cabinet
Upon entering the Forum Gallery, visitors are confronted 
by a looming form ?tted with 80,000 bamboo spikes 
covering its entire frame. The form, a Magistral cabinet, 
is not only meant to contain things, but guard them as 
well, according to the piece’s description. The spikes 
took six weeks and 12 team members to hammer into 
the cabinet, which was constructed of bamboo, glass, 
maple, and plywood in 2011. Through this piece, as 
well as an accompanying Explosion cabinet, Errazuriz 
questions how furniture should be constructed and 
invites visitors to look at them as not simply furniture.
The pieces form eye-catching centerpiece displays 
that are sure to pull viewers further into the gallery. The 
Explosion cabinet, completed in 2014, looks as if half 
of its wooden panels have been blasted into clean-cut 
pieces, but they are not totally separated from the rest of 
the cabinet, which remains a pristine rectangular shape. 
Magistral, on the other hand, has an imposing and 
intimidating, yet admirable quality about it. While it’s 
hard to brush aside the feeling that one could be mortally 
wounded while interacting with the cabinet, it is almost 
impossible not to want to touch the cabinet’s spikes and 
get to the drawers hidden behind them.
DIE and MIRACLE ?yswatters
Among a shelf of household objects, including watches, 
a snow globe, and a salt and pepper shaker, stand two 
?yswatters enclosed in a glass case. One reads “DIE” 
and is covered completely in mesh to make a ?y’s death 
certain. In contrast, the second ?yswatter, called the 
MIRACLE ?yswatter, contains an image of a cross. The 
cross is not covered in mesh, so that, in the event that 
a person swings at a ?y, there is a chance that the ?y 
will move through the void space that makes the cross. 
According to the piece’s description, the DIE ?yswatter 
forces a person to consider the act of killing before they 
perform the act, while the MIRACLE ?yswatter gives a 
?y the chance to live and leaves it up to the user as to 
whether or not they believe the ?y survived by chance or 
miracle.
The ?yswatters, created in 2011 and made of raulí 
wood, transform not only an everyday object, but also 
a mindless action into a deeply personal experience. 
The artist makes the viewer contemplate death and the 
chance life is given to continue living on Earth. Although 
the ?yswatters are small in comparison to many of the 
larger installations of Look Again, they create a pair of 
objects more in?uential than most others in the exhibit.
El Santo
Next to a desk that forces those working at it to look 
at their re?ection in a thin mirror sits a chair, called 
El Santo. Above the chair hangs a halo-shaped bulb. 
The piece, created in 2004 with lacquered wood, a 
?uorescent tube, and electrical parts, turns those who 
sit in it into saints. The piece is meant to question the 
nature of canonization and its possible arbitrariness, 
according to its description.
This seemingly simple piece is one that, beyond 
critiquing religion, brings attention to the notion that 
the titles and honors people give one another are simply 
titles and honors, while people can make themselves 
anything they want given the right tools and mindset.
Boat Cof?n
Down the hall from the Forum Gallery, in the Hall of 
Architecture, stand a number of additional pieces of the 
exhibit. The installations in the hall include a motorcycle, 
a four-tabletop coffee table containing four nude portraits 
of the artist, a piano hanging from the ceiling, and the 
standout of the bunch, Boat Cof?n. This piece is exactly 
what it claims to be: a cross between a boat and a 
cof?n. The cof?n is meant to give the owner a choice 
to face death head on. Owners of boat cof?ns can take 
themselves out to sea to die on their own terms, rather 
than waiting to die a possibly slow and uncomfortable 
death elsewhere.
The piece’s concept is less hard-hitting than the others 
in the exhibit, since the notion that humans have the 
choice to face death when they want has been explored 
many times. However, the piece stands out because of 
the alternative method it presents for an individual’s 
death journey. The cof?n boat is a humorous concept, 
leaving one hard-pressed to ?nd a more ridiculous way 
to end one’s life. The piece is constructed of a cof?n, Braden Kelner | Editor-in-Chief

Boat Coffin allows users to face death head on. If they 
wish to float out to sea as their last wish, they can 
choose to die at their own specified time, rather than 
awaiting a possibly uncomfortable death.

Hot Licks
“Never Catch Me”
Blistering.
In both lyricism and production, this is the single word 
that sums up “Never Catch Me” the new song from Flying 
Lotus featuring verses from Kendrick Lamar, released 
in anticipation of Flying Lotus’s upcoming album You’re 
Dead!, out on Oct. 7.
Two proli?c artists in their respective mediums — Kendrick 
Lamar in rap and Flying Lotus in hip-hop beat production 
— come together on “Never Catch Me” to transcend 
genre norms.
To the point when Kendrick Lamar, through layered vocals, 
sings “you’re never gonna catch me, no,” you can tell he’s 
not trying to make a statement regarding other rappers 
trying to match his skill. Rather, it’s a statement about his 
own creative work outliving himself and, in that way, his 
own mortality will never catch him.

rope, a blanket, gas tank, and ?ashlight, and was 
created in 2009.
Other remarkable pieces in the collection include 
Duck Lamp and Duck Fan, which incorporate 
taxidermy birds into the frameworks of objects. In 
Duck Lamp, a taxidermy goose’s head is replaced 
with a lamp head, while in Duck Fan, a duck is 
placed in front of a fan to show that “birds ?y against 
the wind every day,” according to the piece’s 
description. The artist believed Duck Lamp to ring 
better than Goose Lamp when naming the fan.
There are also shelves created from piano key-like 
black strips and a cabinet with mirrors forming a 
kaleidoscope, as well as Occupy Wall Street signs 
that serve as chairs too, all of which beg viewers to 
question whether or not they can use an object in 
a different way than they are told to use it. At the 
entrance to the exhibit are many of Errazuriz’s initial 
sketchings of the objects he eventually brought to 
life, and a magnetic board placed on the wall next to 
the sketches invites viewers to show off their own 
sketches.
The exhibit is most certainly one of the Carnegie 
Museum of Art’s more unusual displays, with 
striking pieces such as a door with two peep 
holes, behind which lies a wall and a message that 
screams “You are not a pirate!! *open the other 
eye & look again,” among its taxidermy ducks and 
potentially dangerous furniture. Beyond their shock 
factor, the exhibit’s pieces — each and every one of 
them — ask visitors to spend some time with them 
to understand the meaning behind the zany ?rst 
impressions they leave. In a world where people are 
constantly on the move, a collection of work that 
asks people to spend one more second standing in 
meditation to discern multiple meanings and uses 
for an object can do no wrong.

“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.”
Apparently, that’s the inscription marking the Gates 
of Hell, deep down in the haunted catacombs of Paris, 
according to the ?lmmakers of As Above, So Below. 
Unfortunately, that should have been the cautionary 
tagline for this movie and for the poor souls who wasted 
$10 to watch it.
The ?lm starts when Scarlet, a ruthless alchemy scholar, 
?ips open a video camera to introduce herself and to 
explain why she is in Iran. Wanting to ful?ll her late 
father’s quest to ?nd the Philosopher’s Stone (yes, the 
same stone from Harry Potter), Scarlett is in the midst 
of an overly reckless task to ?nd a cipher key that will 
help her ?nd the stone, located in Paris. Finding the key 
entails traveling to underground ruins that will literally 
blow up in two seconds, yet she decides to go ahead and 
search for the key, all the while recording everything. 
She even sees an apparition of her late father in the ruins 
and, instead of bolting out of this creepy underground 
cavern, holds the camera up to him as the ruins explode. 
That’s the ?rst warning for this careless ?op of a ?lm.
Despite the obvious hatred of this movie seeping through 
this review, it is refreshing to see a protagonist who is 
intelligent and has a genuine motivation to carry out 
an expedition at any cost. Her determination to ?nd the 
Philosopher’s Stone is so ?xed that she attracted the 
attention of a documentary ?lmmaker, providing a ?imsy 
excuse for the found-footage style that has to be endured 
for the next 90 minutes. She then recruits her sidekick 
George to help discover the stone and, after recklessly 
destroying museum artifacts (while ?lming her act of 
criminal mischief), partners with a Frenchman named Pap, 
who promises to guide her through the catacombs beneath 
the streets of Paris, where she believes the stone is located.
Early into the journey, the group stumbles into trouble 
as Scarlett wants to go into a forbidden section of the 
catacombs but Pap resists, warning that those who go in 
never come out. Fortunately for Scarlett, the catacombs 
collapse and seal off their escape, trapping them in the 
only undiscovered section of the catacombs. Scarlett, 
unfazed by the creepy female satanic cultists and the 
other highly-visible warning signs of death, encourages 
the crew to venture further underground, suggesting 
that the only way out is to go deeper. It’s kind of 
surprising that the rest of the group actually believes 
that going deeper underground will lead them back up 
to the streets of Paris. But, it is a horror movie, and the 
director probably thought that stupidity is required for 
such a genre.
As they crawl deeper and deeper into the catacombs, 
a series of things start to happen. Unfortunately, these 
“things” are barely enough to give you the creeps, let 
alone a good, old-fashioned scare. The characters start 
experiencing apparitions from each of their tormented 
pasts. Scarlett, again, pays no mind to these apparitions 
and pushes the group onward. Eventually, as they are 
about to enter through the Gates of Hell, the group 
faces a multitude of supernatural forces. Despite this 
promising plot twist, the rest of the ?lm carries off 
like a pointless video game, with no real scares or 
psychological trauma. By this time in the ?lm, the only 
important objective is to wait for the ?lm to end so this 
vomit-inducing journey can be over with.
You would think that when a group of people are about 
to enter the Gates of Hell, their priorities, such as 
carrying around a heavy ?lm camera for the purpose 
of making a documentary, would change somewhat. 
Fortunately, the crew eventually decides to ditch the 
camera as they ?nally realize it’s just one big burden and 
is recording something they most likely won’t want to 
re-watch on a Friday night with a glass of wine. Smart 
decision. But, strangely enough, the ?lm continues with 
the found-footage style .... with no camera. The story 
continues to be told through the point of view of person 
holding a camera and, if they stumble or fall, it’s as if 
the camera falls to the ground and we, the audience, 
are forced to view the ?lm in the perspective of a 
nonexistent video camera. What’s the point of such a 
meaningless medium?
Found footage ?lmmaking is, for the most part, a 
nauseating artistic effect. Cameras are meant to be an 
invisible, yet active spectator. They are a part of the 
characters’ universe and the journey they take part in, 
and we are the natural force that accompanies them. 
A camera can also establish the space of the world 
and help the audience see what the characters cannot, 
establishing elements such as tension, suspense, and 
irony. But, when a director decides to throw in a camera 
that the characters must tote around, the medium 
becomes forced and constricted. We are limited to 
seeing only what the digital camera can see. Instead of 
advancing the plot, the camera now becomes a burden 
for the characters at all times, even during situations 
when they shouldn’t worry about carrying a camera.
As Above, So Below had an interesting premise that 
could have made for a unique ?lm. Setting the ?lm in 
Paris and exploring the underground world below had 
the potential to be a very enjoyable experience. But, 
while the director thought a found-footage format would 
make the ?lm stupendous, it just became stupid.

Based on the young adult novel of the same name by author and YouTube 
personality John Green, The Fault in Our Stars revolves around two teenagers 
who are smitten with each other after meeting in a cancer support group. 
Together they experience the phenomenon of falling in love while simultaneously 
staring death straight in the face. However, the script is written with a degree of 
levity not expected to be paired with a “cancer movie.” Shailene Woodley stars 
as Hazel Grace Lancaster, the female half of this ill-fated couple, and Ansel Elgort 
stars as the witty and charmingly upbeat Augustus Waters. Both actors deliver 
heart-wrenching and tear-jerking performances that require audience members 
to bring boxes of tissues. Anyway, acclaimed movie critic and historian Kim 
Kardashian tweeted, “This movie OMG it’s literally my new Notebook,” so how can 
you not go and see The Fault in Our Stars?”

Finally, Tom Cruise in a role in which he doesn’t play someone who is smooth,

on the Japanese novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, is set in the 
near dystopian future where humans are at war with sinewy robotic aliens called 
Mimics. Although having little to no combat experience, Major William Cage (Tom 
Cruise) is thrown into battle on what appears to be a D-Day-esque battle. Cage 
slowly transforms from a meager soldier into a dynamic hero largely due to Rita 
Vrataski (Emily Blunt), an exceptional soldier and assassin. But here’s the twist: 
every time Cage is killed during battle, he wakes up again and appears to have 
traveled back into the past, giving him the opportunity to right his wrongs á la 
Groundhog Day. Edge of Tomorrow proves to stand out in the ever-expanding 
science ?ction genre.

Microwave cooking is so freshman year. After those two 
wonderfully naive and shiny semesters, life gets real, 
and so does the lack of food in your kitchen, if you’re 
lucky enough to get one on campus or decide to move 
off campus. You’re one year closer to being a real person, 
and part of that life is acknowledging that, yes, you too 
can cook.
So, without further depressing ado about how you 
probably aren’t on the meal plan anymore, here are some 
recipes that will make subsisting not only ?lling, but also 
delicious.
Summer Splunk, serves 2
This dish is named for the sound that the amazing 
vegetable stew makes as you plop it on top of a 
mountain of pasta — splunk. The beauty of this recipe 
is its variability. In the winter, substitute fresh veggies 
for frozen ones. They won’t be quite as delicious, but 
you’ll still be just as satis?ed. To that end, if you don’t 
like one of the ingredients, change it! Trust your gut. 
It’s growling. Make sure to time your multitasking well 
— start the pasta when you start the onion. Then you’ll 
have a chance to drain and cool it before you add it.
1 white onion, chopped
2 cloves of garlic, chopped
2 zucchinis, sliced 
1 container of grape tomatoes, sliced in half
3 spicy Italian sausages, grilled and sliced
3 ears of fresh corn, off the cob
Fresh basil and thyme, to taste
Rosemary, to taste
Olive oil
Salt and pepper, to taste 
½ box of fettuccine, cooked and drained
Parmesan cheese
1) Saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil until the 
onions are limp and the garlic is browned. You should be 
able to smell the deliciousness.
2) Add the zucchini, stirring it in with the onion and 
garlic. Add salt, pepper, and any other spices (except the 
basil) that you’re using. (Hint: Oregano would be a great 
substitute.)
3) When the zucchini is cooked down (it’ll shrink as the 
moisture leaves it), add the tomatoes and corn. These 
vegetables take less time to cook. Add the basil, then 
taste your creation so far. If you think it needs more salt 
or pepper or anything else, add it! You’re in charge here.
4) Toss the sausage in and lower the heat. Let it all stew 
for a few minutes so the ?avors mingle. Flavor mingling 
is essential.
5) Toss the drained and cooled pasta with olive oil and 
some salt. Put a generous serving on a plate.
6) Top that with a serving of the veggies, the cheese, and 
any remaining basil.
Not Your Momma’s Fried Rice, serves 2
Greasy fried rice is the ultimate guilty pleasure when 
the 2 a.m. munchies strike. The next time your mouth 
waters at the thought of the sticky rice and the salty 
sting of soy sauce, close the GrubHub tab on your 
browser and make your own. The key to a great fried 
rice is the rice. A sticky white rice makes for a perfectly 
textured ?nal product. Use leftover rice from last night’s 
order to make yourself feel better about the fact that 
you’re eating at 2 a.m. in the ?rst place.
1 cup of white rice, cooked 
1 bag of frozen veggies, defrosted so they won’t be 
watery and gross
Chicken, cooked (or tofu, or beef, or pork, or nothing if 
you aren’t feeling very protein-y)
2 eggs
Soy sauce
Sesame oil (if you don’t have it, don’t sweat it)
Conquer your hunger and learn to cook
Abandon your meal plan, turn your back on GrubHub, and get to GEagle: you’re cooking
Don’t have fresh zucchini, tomatoes, or corn? Just 
substitute canned or frozen vegetables in Summer 
Splunk. It’ll be just as good.
Laura Scherb | Operations Manager
by Laura Scherb | Operations Manager[]
Lots of vegetable oil
Lots of salt
Red pepper ?akes
Paprika
Ginger
1) Start by throwing some vegetable oil in a pan. Make it 
a big pan, though, because all of this is going in.
2) Cook the veggies in the oil, making sure that they’re 
not too watery going in. Watery veggies make for sad 
fried rice. Season them appropriately.
3) When the veggies start to brown and get crispy, add 
some sesame oil and soy sauce and let them fry in the 
oils for a bit. This frying is essential for ?avoring the fried 
rice.
4) Add your protein of choice and lightly fry it with the 
veggies and oils. Add more seasoning if you think it 
needs it.
5) Add the rice to the pan and stir it around to mix 
everything in together. Keep stirring so nothing sticks to 
the pan and burns.
6) Make a hole in the middle and crack the eggs into it. 
Let them cook just until the whites are turning ... well, 
white, and then stir them into everything else. Make 
sure there’s an even coating and don’t forget to stir! Your 
tongue will thank you later.
7) When the egg-covered mixture of deliciousness is 
cooked, add a decent amount of soy sauce. I usually 
keep adding until everything has turned brown, but 
it depends on what you like! Add more spice here if 
desired.
8) Let the soy sauce cook into everything for about a 
minute, then take it off the heat. Consume and let the 
food coma begin.
Sweet Potato Salad, serves 4 as a side
This recipe is easy. And it’s vegan. It’s v-easy. Even if 
you love eating animal products, you’ll still fall head-over-
heels for this substantial salad. With a nice baguette, this 
could easily become a cheap but impressive dinner for 
two. Moreover, it’s embarrassingly easy, super healthy, 
and pretty darn delicious. You literally cannot lose.
3 or 4 large sweet potatoes (or yams)
1 purple onion, chopped
2 avocados, diced
1 red pepper, diced
2 cans of black beans, drained
1 can of corn, drained
Olive oil, for drizzling
1 bunch of cilantro (unless you’re one of those people 
who is genetically predisposed to hating cilantro 
because it tastes like soap)
Salt and pepper to taste
1) The ?rst thing you have to do is preheat the oven to 
400 degrees. Don’t panic about the fact that you’re using 
the oven. It’s just for baking the potatoes. Stay with me.
2) Next, take a large, very sharp knife and slice the sweet 
potatoes or yams. The slices should be reasonably thick 
but not thick enough that they don’t cook. I usually 
eyeball it, but for those of you who need a measurement, 
I would say around 1/2 inch. But, again, don’t panic if 
they’re too big or too small. It’ll work out.
3) Toss the slices in some olive oil, then put them in a 
pan and roast them for about 20 minutes. Check them 
often to make sure they’re not burning to crisps. When 
they’re soft enough to be speared by a fork, take them 
out and set them aside to cool.
4) Chop, dice, and drain everything that needs to be 
chopped, diced, or drained. Combine all of the chopped, 
diced, or drained things in a large bowl and set it aside.
5) Now that your potatoes have cooled a little bit, dice 
them and add them to the bowl. Toss everything around 
so the colors mix up and it looks fun and festive. Add 
your salt and pepper until it tastes seasoned to you.
6) Chop some cilantro and sprinkle it on top to make it 
look fancy, like you know what you’re doing.
7) Set it on the table, admire, and pat yourself on the 
back for making something that gorgeous. Then make 
sure you turn the oven off.
Note: This recipe was inspired in part by a recipe found 
on audreysapron.wordpress.com.
One Last Bite of Wisdom 
There is little feeling more satisfying — or adult-
like — than sitting down to a plateful of food that 
you just brought into existence with your own two 
hands, a few appliances, and a recipe. Not only did 
you create something, but now you get to stuff your 
face and Instagram a picture to make your friends 
jealous. Chances are, it’s healthier, cheaper, and more 
aesthetically pleasing than what they’re eating tonight.
Don’t be afraid to change things about recipes to make 
them taste better for you. You won’t ruin it — you’ll only 
make something new. Cooking isn’t about being right 
or wrong. It’s about ?nding what tastes good to you and 
sharing it with your friends and family.
Or keeping it for yourself, pigging out, and slipping 
slowly into a food coma as you realize just how amazing 
you are at life.
Sweet potato salad plays the sweet richness of potato (or yam, depending on what kind of person you are) 
against the sharp flavor of onion, the smoothness of buttery avocados, and the zing of cilantro.

Serve the Summer Splunk over freshly cooked fettuc-

Five artists, all Pittsburgh based, unveiled 
installations at the Mattress Factory on Friday night 
at an opening reception for the museum’s ongoing 
Artists in Residence exhibit. Diaspora by Ryder 
Henry, damn everything but the circus by Benjamin 
Sota, Word Balloons by John Peña, and Is Always, 
What Does It Mean?, Again and Again. by Danny 
Bracken will all be on display in the main Mattress 
Factory gallery, with Body Memory Architecture by 
Kathleen Montgomery on display at the museum’s 
off-site gallery through May 31, 2015.
 
There are four installations in the main gallery, each 
?lling an entire room.
Diaspora, by Ryder Henry, is an immensely detailed 
futuristic city made from cardboard boxes. The 
city is at once both familiar and alien. Rather 
than opting for a concrete jungle, Henry creates 
a grassy suburbia, punctuated by foreign objects, 
black in color with asymmetric outlines and 
visually challenging structures. Elements of both 
dystopian and idealistic science ?ction are present. 
Red colored retro-futuristic rockets and circular 
skyscrapers pulled out from a Jetsons cartoon 
reside less than a block away from modern housing 
developments and heavy industrial machines, 
which look more like the burned out carcasses of 
spaceships than a traditional factory. Outside the 
city are ?oating islands that represent isolated 
memories from the creator’s life. From a Chinese 
restaurant to a school and more, Henry seems 
devoted to inciting feelings of nostalgia and personal 
recognition from viewers.
There’s also a larger grid of isolated apartment 
buildings, each on a small platform rising up from 
the ground. The isolated buildings are spread 
across an entire room, giving the viewer a sense 
of scale and isolation. The manner in which Henry 
experiments with space was one of my favorite 
sensations in the museum. 
There exists yet another part of the exhibit, the 
wildest yet, composed of fantastical rounded 
circular starships adorned with Arabic symbols 
and incisions taken straight from a mosque. Afro-
futurism is a relatively well-known and interesting 
art form, but this may be the ?rst time I’ve seen an 
attempt at Arabic futurism pulled off. The exhibit 
ends with a model of the starship Enterprise, again 
adorned with Arabic patterns and surrounded by a 
web of magazine clippings from Henry’s life, once 
more demonstrating his willingness to straddle the 
boundaries between fantastical abstraction and 
deeply personal expression.
In contrast, Benjamin Sota’s damn everything but 
the circus, was unfortunately not as engaging. 
The cleverly-placed turnstile at the installation’s 
entrance into a room-sized red tent is exciting, but 
what awaits inside is a rather uninspired simulation 
of a circus. The ?rst noticeable thing about the 
tent is the oddly chosen jazz music (does circus 
music often feature live saxophone?) and shifting 
lighting. It ?uctuates between “daytime” (overly red-
orange glow) to bluish nightclub lighting. Finally, 
the physical exhibits — a trapeze, a wire, and a 
strongman’s ball — were very uninspired. A little 
more visual challenge and abstraction could have 
been used here. 
 
Word Balloons by John Peña fared a little better. 
The exhibit consisted of two huge comic word 
balloons and translates a pop culture icon from a 
2-D to a 3-D medium. However, the word balloons 
themselves distract from the other aspects of the 
exhibit. The smaller balloon says “Sometimes I 
just don’t know how to feel in the world”, while 
the larger one reads “So I talk and talk and work 
to ?ll the emptiness.” While the concept of literally 
using a physical manifestation of speech to ?ll 
“emptiness” is an interesting use of the size of the 
balloons, I found myself to be rather mesmerized by 
the smooth curves and dimensionality of the speech 
balloon itself. Instead of feeling the awkwardness 
of what Pena was trying to convey, I actually found 
myself being inexplicably calmed by the shape and 
smoothness of the speech bubble.
 
Finally, Danny Bracken’s exhibit: Is Always, What 
Does it Mean?, Again and Again. is actually three 
different components in one room, tied together by a 
common atmosphere. This exhibit is the best of the 
bunch. The light in the room is completely dimmed, 
save for spotlights illuminating each component. 
Bracken also uses music effectively to create a 
serene and calming environment. In seeking to make 
his viewer contemplate the essence of nature and 
man-made simulation, Bracken is successful. In the 
?rst third of the room, Bracken has two pods, one of 
actual dirt and grass, and a separate one consisting 
of a digital projection of dirt and grass on a curved 
surface. Using the music as an emotional baseline of 
sorts, Bracken seems to ask whether the projection 
of grass and dirt can match the emotional response 
of the real thing. The next component reinforces this 
idea, a screen showing shifting, rounded, cool blue 
shapes. Looking at the screen, and the blue patterns 
moving across it coupled with the ambient music, it 
is easy to recreate the emotional response from the 
natural scene it emulates. The ?nal component is a 
man-made rainbow, a stream of water droplets being 
sprayed from the ceiling and creating a hoop-shaped 
double rainbow. More self-contained than a natural 
rainbow, the ?nal component seems to suggest that 
simulated, digital art can indeed be more impressive 
than the real thing.
