LUTHERAN CAMPUS MINISTRY
4515 Forbes (Across Scaife Art Museum) 682-6886
Wisdom, Light and Life come to each 
man through the worship of his God. 
Weekly celebrations of Word and 
Sacrament "happen" Sundays at —I>)I 
a.m. at the Center Chapel.
Christ rules the world and his people 
serve in the world. LCM's Outreach 
Program extends the ministry to the 
campus through phone calls, personal 
contacts and programs.
When you're down and troubled and 
you need a helping hand, LCM can 
help. Pastoral Counseling provides in­
dividual attention to your needs. 
Creative Transitions offers workshops 
and group experiences to assist 
through stressful periods of change.
Students and faculty enjoy a quiet in­
formal atmosphere when they lunch at 
the Center. Served from 11:30 a.m. til 
1:15 p.m. the foods are prepared by 
members of area Lutheran churches 
and cost only 95*.
Weekend nights are for fun and 
relaxation. The Alternative is a cof­
fee house offering exotic coffees and 
teas, sandwiches and snacks. En­
tertainment of folk music, mellow rock 
and poetry makes it a refreshing 
change from the regular scene.
Christian fellowship with a larger com­
munity is available through the 
Lutheran Student Movement. Retreats 
and conferences offer various ways to 
serve and grow in your faith.
Sing for Joy to the Lord, all the 
World!
Worship the Lord gladly,
and come before Him with joy­
ful songs!
Never forget that the Lord is God ! 
He made us and we belong to 
him;
We are his people, we are his 
flock.
Enter his temple thanksgiving,
Go into his sanctuary with 
praise!
Give thanks to him and praise 
him!
The Lord is good;
his love lasts forever,
and his faithfulness for all 
time. (Ps. 100)

Breaking Bad Habits
There are a few regular things we can count on every year 
when we come back to school:-the crowded dorms, hassles 
with housing and parking, lines at the bookstore and com­
plaints about all the changes that were made during the 
summer.
Last year the big controversy was the renovation of the 
Tartan Grill. Students complained that money was spent 
needlessly: “We liked it the way it was before. ” and “The 
the lines and the wait for service are too long. It seems 
that as soon as something is changed we forget how bad it 
was.
There are a few regular things we can count on every year 
when we come back to school: the crowded dorms, hassles 
with housing and parking, lines at the bookstore and com­
plaints about all the changes that were made during the 
summer.
Last year the big controversy was the renovation of the 
Tartan Grill. Students complained that money was spent 
needlessly: “We liked it the way it was before.” and “The 
the lines and the wait for service are too long. ” Students 
complained that they couldn’t see the dock from anywhere 
in the Grill.
They moved the dock so it could be seen from the lower 
level and finished the game room. Now the whole issue 
is forgotten. Freshmen aren’t aware of what went on last 
year and the upperclassmen don’t care anymore: it wasn’t
really important to begin with.
It seems that as soon as something is changed we forget 
how bad it was. With the Tartan Grill, the cashier was con­
stantly being shuffled around, and everyone working behind 
the counter waited on the same customer at the same time.
This year we have the Morewood Desk. Some students 
seem to feel that because there is no longer anyone sitting 
there all day and night that they are being ripped-off. Maybe 
so, but could it be possible that the administration is really 
doing us a favor by ridding us of an expensive luxury?
What functions did the Morewood Desk really perform?
The desk attendants served as a source of information, 
collected maintenance requests from 5 p.m. to 8:30 a.m. , iVmr 7r 7rer Ur1b,VNrU NVtN 
distributed mail and packages, and provided room keys when NVr uPguPK 7tl bmNrerlNrU bm

Skibo Information Desk will now be the main campus in- NVr mr7 yo8bt1 y8brm8r SrcteN-
formation center. Any question you would have asked at nrmN9 NVrer 7rer t manMre o2
Morewood can now be answered in Skibo. Hill residents have 
always complained that the Morewood residents had an ad­
vantage because the desk was there. It was a nuisance for
someone who lived in Donner to walk to Morewood to get a 1 ^ Pean ferine ^ th®
room key, especially at night. Centrally locating the main 
information source is inconvenient for Morewood Gar­
dens residents, but it is now more accessible to the rest of the 
campus community.
The only function the Desk provided as far as maintenance 
was concerned, was to collect the requests and turn them 
into the Housing Office if the attendant remembered at 8:30 
a.m. Put your work requests under the Housing Office 
door. They’ll have to trip over them in the morning and that 2' Sep (rr yp yceoa11 er8rmN15

way you can be sure someone at least sees it.
Mail and packages are being distributed from 8 a.m. to 
12 noon.
Room keys are available in the Housing Office 8:30 a.m. 
to 5:00 p.m. After those hours residents can contact the 
Resident Directors to get into their rooms.
/ can hear it now “BUT WHA T ABOUT SECURITY?!,?!?” 
Anything is better than what we had before; if a grand piano 
can grow legs and walk out of that lobby, then Morewood 
is not very secure.
In response to this security problem a Morewood Monitor 
has been hired. This person patrols the lobby while in direct 
radio contact with the Campus Security Office. Auxiliary 
Services is now looking into hiring someone to do the same 
thing for the Hill Dorms.
Sure it was nice to see a familiar face behind the desk 
when you came in, especially after a late night studying 
or working. But that was getting to be an expensive luxury.
C mon people, let’s put all this energy into something 
worthwhile! What about the housing shortage? Bill Dillon 
recently said that seniors and juniors will probalby not be 
able to live in the dorms next year. And didn’t they promise 
us a r rreation room in Morewood?

HOW YA GONNA KEEP 
'EM DOWN ON THE FARM 
Editor:
I think that students who 
get drunk or high should be 
severely disciplined. As a Fresh­
man with little experience in the 
areas of self-abuse, I was appalled 
at the so called “fun” that my 
fellow freshman and upperclass­
men engaged in during the parties 
this past weekend.
We are at CMU to learn, 
not to drink and allow our minds
and bodies to be destroyed. 
While I was at the fraternity 
parties, a number of guys came 
up to me with the foul smell on 
their breath and asked me to 
dance or talk to them. I just 
laughed at them. Who do they 
think they are? And don’t they 
know what they’re doing to 
themselves?
I went to high school in 
a small, suburban, conservative 
town, yet we found fun things 
to do besides drinking, or get­
ting high. I can love a man only 
when he is in complete con­
trol of himself. Otherwise, I 
would rather stay in my room 
and do my homework.
A girl who doesn’t 
like what she sees
TAKE IT WITH A 
GRAIN OF SALT
Editor:
I’m a fairly decent looking 
guy with a fairly common com­
plaint. It’s about some of the girls 
on the CMU campus. I’ve already 
given up on the good looking girls. 
They’re taken, or snobbish, or too 
good for me. So my complaint 
isn’t about those girls. What I’d 
like to complain about is the not 
so good looking girls. They’re 
becoming as snobbish and taken 
as the good looking ones!
Yes, it’s true. The average 
girls on the CMU campus have 
become as self-assured and ar­
rogant as the cream of the crop. 
The reason is probably because
there are so many boys around 
and not enough of them. Con­
sequently, we boys have to take 
what we can get, and now we’re 
getting the shaft. Let me put 
it this way. It’s not fair.
Girls should behave as humbly 
as their place and class in society 
dictates. And “not-so-nice look­
ing” girls should surely act hum­
ble. Not self-centered, conceited 
and in control. Just because 
there aren’t enough of the good 
looking girls to go around, doesn’t 
mean that the rest of the girls 
have to fill in their places. Enough 
said. But a pretty face is like a 
rhapsody. An ugly one, isn’t much 
better than the flip side of a 45

the chairmanship of Seantor James S. 
McClure has provided the Division of 
Student Affairs with two applications for 
internships in Washington. They advise that 
they are currently reviewing applications 
for January, 1978. The competition for 
positions is particularly keen. They are 
eager, however, to emphasize internships 
during the school year. No compensation is 
offered to the interns. They do, however, 
seem to represent a special opportunity for 
students in Engineering and Public Policy.
If you are interested in further informa­
tion, Mrs. Draper and the Office of the 
Dean of Student Affairs will have copies 
of the announcement and applications.

tution for pre-law preparation. Most law 
schools'do not require particular under­
graduate course structures or particular 
pre-law courses. However, we do recom­
mend that those who are considering law 
school should take a basic course in Ac­
counting, (70-121, Quantitative Controls in 
Business), the basic course in micro eco­
nomics, (70-331, Business Enterprise), 
and a course in English Composition, (76- 
550, Exposition I). Other than this, law 
schools indicate that they prefer a breadth 
and diversity of knowledge as preparation 
for a professional career in the law. It 
would be entirely acceptable, therefore, for 
the Pre-Law student to choose any college 
on this campus.
While they are not required for law 
school admission, there are a number of 
law courses available so that the student 
may test his/her aptitude for such material.
Information about law school applica­
tions and admissions can be obtained from

TARTAN FOUO
SEPTEMBER 13, 1977/ISSUE ELEVEN: FRESHMEN
Do you ever get the urge to write satire, hu­
mor, poetry or features?
Do you ever fantasize seeing 5,500 copies of 
your work distributed to all your friends and 
classmates?
Or do you ever v. :nder how it would be pos­
sible for the whole campus to see the talent you 
have at illustrating, drawing or designing?
Do you ever tell yourself that there's no such 
outlet for your writing or artistic skills and am­
bitions? If you do, then you're dead wrong.
You have FOLIO.
Boy, DO YOU EVER!!
FOLIO is the bi-weekly supplement to the 
TARTAN that gives the CMU student a chance to 
write or draw and to see it the next week in print. 
It's a great opportunity.
Your creativity is almost unlimited. You can 
express yourself in any way as long as it fits into 
the framework of the usually broad theme.
There's no work involved except free-lance 
submitting. After that, just wait to see your work 
in print.
You can use FOLIO as your sounding board, 
and FOLIO can use you. Call 682—8526 and ask 
for Jeffrey. Or leave your name and number at 
the Skibo information desk in care of the 
TARTAN.

Directions of a
Freshman
by Alison Cornish
So this is CMU...Hmm. Doesn't look like much in 
the rain. Neither does Pittsburgh, for that matter. 
And where do we register for our rooms? End of 
the line, please.
And where do we get our linens? End of the line, 
please.
And how about....? End of the line, please.
After waving sadly to the loved ones, and as they 
drive away, one begins to wonder what's next. 
What direction? Do I cry, laugh, get drunk, 
become introverted? What's next?
FRESHMAN WEEKEND proclaims the schedule. 
Oh.
Much to my amazement, the buses actually left 
on time. Well, almost on time. I mean, buses 
never leave on time. Maybe this was a signal of 
things to come? One way or another, we were off. 
FRESHMAN OPTIONS '77 promises that Fresh­
man Weekend will “stay a part of you long after 
it's over." It just might. Although, I strongly 
believe(and hope) the memories will long outlast 
the bruises, scrapes, and mosquito bites.
Once the weekend was under way, we quickly 
got the hang of rattling off the "vital statistics": 
"What's your name? Where do you come from? 
Where are you staying? What's your major? 
Funny, after most of us left our home town quite 
eagerly, we were just as eager to find someone 
from that same town.
But our enthusiastic counsellors were not about
Weekend
to let us stagnate, at any cost. The round-the- 
clock volleyball game was soon under way, as 
were similar frisbee, soccer and football games. 
Most others settled for impromptu discussions 
and bull sesssions.
The activity picked up even more after dinner 
(possibly as an adverse reaction?) Some returned 
to volleyball, but others chose the square dance, 
movie, or coffeehouses as a place to meet people. 
And that we did. People. And more people. 
Everywhere you looked.
Later on that same night a theatre company of 
three, known as the Iron Clad Agreement presen­
ted a uniquely stylized historical play, based op 
the life of George Eastman.
Sunday was highlighted by "Student Reactions"; 
Specifically, ten of the counsellors relating some­
thing that was important to them to the relatively 
"unpracticed" freshmen. Topics ranged from re­
ligion to travel to comedy, yet all seemed to have 
direction in common. Direction for themselves, 
and a direction to communicate to us, as we were 
moving to a new direction ourselves.
Back at the dorm, What if? and I wonder? ques­
tions popped back into my head. Lacking a vol­
leyball to drive it out, panic set in.
But after one last long look at last year's year­
book, I turn to my new direction. Apprehensive? 
Yes. Petrified? That, too. But I'll make it — it's 
my direction.
Housing Haspoken
by Karen Joy Ra vets 
Housing has spoken,
On the first morning, 
Smiles as tokens,
On the first day.
Praise for the Hillside, 
Praise for the Garden, 
Praise for full service, 
Modern in ways.
Fresh Flooding toilets, 
Sweet the rains this fall, 
Like the first dew fall, 
On a glass pain.
Praise for the sweetness, 
Of Soaking corridors, 
Sprung in completeness, 
Dirty rug floors.
All buildings the same, 
Mine is the Hillside, 
Yours is the Gardens, 
Born of one light. 
Housing saw humor, 
Praise every mourning, 
Hush recreation,
Quiet suicide play.
Housing has spoken.

“What we need here is some...”
by Laura Wi/kens
I was so excited! Here I was, a big freshman on 
her way to the big city to attend the big 
university! I had it all organized in my head. I 
would spend 4 years studying piano with only the 
best. I'd graduate with honors (of course), be 
given a grant to study at Julliard or maybe Curtis 
to get my masters and soon be presented to the 
world as the bestest and brightest pianist this side 
of Jocelyn Rothbarger. (Everyone had nodded 
their heads when I announced my plans to be a 
concert pianist. I think they only let me ramble 
on like that because they hoped that I'd get preg­
nant or something, marry "that creep who did 
this to her" and drop out, thus saving them a 
good $20,000.)
My piano teacher told me to go to the city. 
""Lot's of opportunity there! Lots of museums 
and concert halls and other cultural centers! 
Lots and lots!" Yay, for the museums! Yay, for 
the concerts! Yay for the city!
Daddy and I loaded up the cai. I had all the 
things I would need. I had carefully organized it 
in boxes, then labeled each one. Sweaters, wool 
skirts and bras in box No. 1; jeans, *ancy shoes 
and bedding in box No. 2; T-shirts, coats and 
stocking in box No. 3 and so on. All very w«ll 
organized.
( Then we hit the main road. And another main 
.. road, and another main road, and another main. .
. . and nobody told me that the city was clear on 
the other side of the globe! But we finally arrived 
at the city. This had to be the city. It had said 
"Pittsburgh—35 miles" on that silly sign 20 
minutes back. It looked kind of big.
But nobody'd told daddy how big the city was. 
So we got lost. And loster, and loster. We didn't 
worry about it though. We were organized in how 
we got lost. We took only every other right turn 
when we weren't sure which way was correct, 
y Then we pulled out our handy-dandy little maps, 
and our trusty-dusty little guide book, and our
v nifty-spifty little color post cards that say "Greet­
ings from Pittsburgh" on the front and have 5 
separate views of 3 different "still meels." They 
didn't help much. All we saw were these stupid 
looking plate-glass buildings.
After about an hour and a half or so, we gave 
up trying to get un-lost, and asked a person 
standing on the sidewalk where we were. He 
laughed. Daddy snorted and drove away. I wasn't 
sure that we had the right city. But the catalogue 
said "Pittsburgh" and that's what the sign 
d outside of one of the tall plate-glass buildings, 
ivertheless, we stopped someone else. They 
ighed even harder. Daddy swore. I'd never 
ird him swear before. 
r irm passed a road side stand a while later that
jncvas called "Boy, are YOUiost!" We stopped and 
^hrisked directions.
"Howdie folks! My name is Marachino Mapper 
and I can tell that you is just dying for a map to 
your destination. Well, if 01' Marachino here 
ain't got it, it can't be found! Need a map to a 
restaurant? Look under the second stack 
the left, bottom shelf. Need to find a gas
find you again! What's yer Pleasuer?"
We asked him where Carnegie-Mellon was. 
"Carnegie WHO!?!" he said. ,
But we found a map with CMU marked on it at 
the bottom of "Rest Stops-Q." So we were off 
and running again. "Don't forget to tell 'em 
Marachino Mapper sent ya!" Boy, were we lost. 
Boy were we lost. Boy, was he organized. I wasn't 
very excited anymore. Yay for the city. Yay for 
organization. Daddy swore again.
Well, after consulting 20 pedestrians, 4 copys, 
7 police cars, ran into 9 restaurants and pulled in 
and out of 19 gas stations, we found the Univer­
sity, neatly tucked away behind a rather large 
complicated park, and a one way sign. The only 
problem now was how to get ON campus. Daddy 
swore again. So did I. So we just parked our car 
next to the curb looking* like two overdrawn
us that I was definitely registered in a dorm, but 
it wasn't exactly..done..yet, and that I'd be 
staying in Webster Hall until it was finished. But 
they didn't know where Webster Hall was, un­
fortunately.
I went and got the phone book. Good old phone 
book. I haven't met one yet that didn't have its 
act together. Webster Hall Hotel could be under 
W for Webster, H for Hotel, C for C-MU students, 
D for dorm, or T for temporary dorm. Lets hear 
it for the phone book! Lets hear it for organiza­
tion! It wasn't listed.
Daddy and I set out again feeling somewhat 
disillusioned. We took every other turn, just 
like we had been, and lo and behold!, we found 
it! Cheer, Cheer! Hooray, hooray! There it 
was! We stopped and told the doorman we were 
here for the C-MU dorming. He looked at us
urled oion starting with the letter 'Y'? Look in the
shelf up, 9th. stack. Yisser, I got it all orga- 
^ed here. You lost? Well, me and my maps'l
checking accounts until this big gray van pulled 
up next to us. It said C-MU Security on the side. 
Daddy and I smiled. The man sitting in the van 
told us that we'd have to move along. "This is a 
highly organized traffic system we run around 
here, and you're disrupting it. Besides, we don't 
allow vagrancy in front of our campus. Image, 
you understand. "We told him that we under­
stood perfectly, and could he tell us how to get 
onto the campus? "Well, no folks, I'm sorry I 
don't even know the way myself. I just patrol 
the area. I don't go ON campus. Sorry. And 
don't forget to move your car." Daddy swore. 
So did I. Loudly.
So we drove off again. And, surprise, surprise, 
we stumbled onto campus! We parked again, 
and set out on foot to find out where my dorm 
was. But none of the students knew where the 
administrative offices were. We walked into 4 
buildings before we found the right one. Hous­
ing? 3rd floor. Housing? Oh no, I'm sorry. 
That's on the 4th. Housing? Who told you 4th 
floor? It's on the 20th. (there is no 20th) Oh, 
well then try Porter hall.
Porter what?
We finally found someone who told us exactly 
where the housing office was. But once we got 
there, we were sent to 4 other people to find out 
which dormitory I was staying in. They told
in disbelief. I unloaded my 17 boxes (all neatly 
organized) and my 2 trunks (labeled to perfec­
tion) and my 3 suitcases. He believed us. He also 
groaned.
Nonetheless, he took us up the 4 flights of stairs, 
and around the 6 bends only to find that the lady 
for the dorm rooms had been moved. He groaned 
again. After 6 more false tries, we found her 
waiting patiently in the vestibule, notebook in 
hand. "Oh, but there must be some mistake on 
your «art. You're in Morewood. We're highly 
organized here, so you must have misunderstood 
them." When we asked her where Morewood 
was, she said that she couldn't tell us. She only 
took care of Webster people. We left again, the 
doorman huffing and puffing along in tow with 
my 17 boxes (all completely organized), my 2 
trunks (labeled to perfection) and my 3 suitcases. 
We loaded up the car again and set off. "Good 
luck! " said the doorman, "and don't come 
back!"
We got lost again trying to find the campus. We 
stopped 14 policemen, 12 pedestrians, and a blind 
man. The blind man said "Yes, I know where it 
is, but I couldn't tell you. I don't know the street 
names. They said the streets were too compli­
cated to understand at The School for the Blind." 
Daddy and I swore together.

“Hello It’s Me”
by Jim Costello
"Hello, yes operator, I'd like to place a collect 
call to Rosewood, Iowa. My name is Ron Kline."
"Hello, Kathy, get Mom."
"Hello Mom this is Ron."
"Don't give me that Ron who. Ron, your son! 
The one you just brought to Carnegie-Mellon a 
week ago. Yeah that's right, five eight, curly hair. 
You got it."
"What? oh, funny Mom."
"What! You're not kidding. You, you really did 
rent out my room."
"His name is Harold?"
"What! No, Mom, really quit kidding around."
"Come on Mom I really did call you to tell how 
I was."
"Mom, I'm tellin' ya stop it now."
"No Mom, I don't believe that Dad was trans- 
fered and that your moving to France next 
week."
"Oh, you're serious. Well then...uh...send me 
your new address and a...a map of how to get 
there. Okay?"
"What? Excuse me I'm sorry Mom but we must 
have a bad connection. There seems to be a lot of 
noise on the line could you repeat that?"
"Oh, that's Dad. Well what's he doing that's 
making so much noise?"
"Sawing a hole in the kitchen floor! Well this
may seem like a stupid question to you but
why?"
"Yeah, well that explains it, but we don't have a 
third floor."
"We do now! I see."
"Wait a second, let me get this straight. While 
you're in France the house is going to be con­
verted into a discotheque so that Dad will have 
something to keep him occupied after he retires." 
"It's going to be topless."
"And you're going to be the hostess?"
"Right Mom."
"No, no, it's your life. Far be it from me-" 
"Yes Mom, yes I'm eating my vegetables." 
"The food. Eh it's all right I guess."
"No Mom. No one makes Horseradish Surprise 
like you. In fact, I don't think anyone even 
attempts."
"My roomate. He's from China. I think." 
"Oh we get along fine. But we really don't com­
municate. I think I'm going to have to pick up 
an English-Chinese dictionary somewhere."
"No really he's alright. Except for this four foot 
sword he carries around. Oh yeah, and he's 
pretty touchy about criticism. He has this other 
knife and he kneels on the floor and puts it to 
his chest. I think he's a sort of fatilist.
"Hello, Dad."
"Yes I know what I'm here for."
"No I won't go to too many parties."
"Yes I'll study hard."
"The Deans list."
"Well I don't-"
"Of course, you're right it can't hurt to try." 
"Okay, Dad, okay."
"Well listen this call is starting to cost a fortune 
so I'll be seeing you around Thanksgiving, in 
France.
"Ya I'll write."
"Bye."
Slowly Ron brought the reciever away from his 
ear and back to the cradle. He stood up and 
slowly walked to the door. He sighed under his 
breath. He could not help thinking, "How things 
have changed."
Then his mind snapped. His thoughts wandered 
to his girl friend. He wondered how she was 
getting along at art school. He lit a cigarette and 
sighed.

The Frosh Connection
by Carla Jackson-* With the beginning of the fall semester comes 
the time to dispel once and for all, the myths 
surrounding the creature known as the Freshman 
Female. As an upperclass woman, I can state with 
authority that there is absolutely nothing to their 
soi-distant "mystique."
Consider this scenario, which takes place at the 
annual Welcoming Bash. Background music is 
provided by a local talent band playing an eclectic 
mixture of Chicago, Zeppelin, and KC; the net 
result is akin to the sound of a stack of 45's left 
on a warm radiator. Amidst the noise and chaos 
indigenous to 400 post-pubescents in close 
quarters, one may study various "types."
The Quad is packed with frat brothers chug-a- 
lugging Iron City from house-insignia mugs as 
they regale one another with the stories of their
* most colorful and recent carnal conquests. The 
ones chuckling most smugly are undoubtedly 
those who have already checked out the in­
coming talent in the Pic(k) Book, and who have 
formulated their subsequent plan of attack 
accordingly. Small packs of freshman males hover 
nearby, trying to look suave and wordly, as much 
to impress Rush Chairmen as the females there.
| They are generally unable to suppress the 
urge to spit watermelon seeds at the Morewood 
Fountain, causing someone to mutter, "You can 
dress these kids up, but . . . Upperclass non- 
greeks of both sexes cluster about, mostly con­
cerned with extending the lovely blase feelings of 
a summer past just a little longer.
About an hour into the evening, when most of 
their male counterparts are off getting sick, the 
Freshman Girls make their collective appearance. 
The concept of a fashionably late "grand entry" 
is somewhat marred by the fact that several hun­
dred girls are descending en masse, but the effect 
is still stunning. Imagine several dozen squads of 
high school rah-rah-and-prom-queen types poured 
into 26" Levi's and sequined T-shirts, hair 
whipped into Farrah-like disarray. With bodies
1 shaking and teeth flashing, they gravitate uner­
ringly towards the ATO jock-types, assiduously 
ignoring the quaking comp-sci majors who hold 
these women in much the same awe as a Digital 
CV—1200.
The athletes, in turn, flex their muscles and 
smirk covertly as they envision the evening's cul­
mination with these sweet, nubile, 18-year-olds 
who, golly gee, have never seen the inside of a frat 
house. Plied with beer, barbecues, and bulging 
biceps, they are surely vulnerable to the charms 
of the Upperclassman.
It should be, but rarely is, apparent to these 
predatory individuals that whatever they're after 
from these innocent little post-debs has been long 
since conquered by the first high school senior 
who had similar ideas 4 years ago.
This is actually an academic point, however, as 
the combined effects of their initial Pittsburgh- 
brewery binge on top of their first Skibo meal is 
generally sufficient to put their metabolisms in a 
state of flux. Either the young lady ends up 
curled over in the ladies' room or in such a cata­
tonic stupor that they're really not all that much 
fun.
It would then appear that the ideal course of 
action would be to bank on experience and leave 
the "novices" to the Fresh and the engineers. 
After all, wasn't it D.H. Lawrence who once ob­
served that, "coeds, like fine wine, improve with 
age?"
No, you say? No matter—come on up and we 
can discuss it at length.
What He’ll be Li he
by Saul Carliner
"Well, well, well... if it isn't Simon Newman. I've 
been hearing a lot about you: about how you're a 
fantastic kid, I mean. Like, I've heard so many 
good things about you. Man, everyone thinks it's 
great that you won the second grade spelling bee, 
and how 'bout that award in sixth grade for best 
attendance. And I think it was a real bummer 
when Seattle Stud nearly broke your arm in tenth 
grade to get you to give him the answers to the IQ 
test, and they disqualified you later when you 
were caught giving him the answers . Of course, 
he did score a 168. But, getting the letter for the 
best ping-pong team manager made up for it, and 
especially the hot date to your senior prom with 
that real fox, Ariselda Fatwoman. Simon, you're 
just so spectacular, it's a privilege to be your 
roommate."
Alright, so I'm just a plain Joe. I got to build 
myself up, or else I'd feel so intimidated by 
everyone else. Like my roommate.
Instead of that great welcome, I walked into my 
empty basement dorm room, hall bathroom on 
one side, laundry room on the other. I couldn't 
make up my mind which side of the room to 
take, but my stuff fell down on the left, so I took 
that side. It was late, so I made my bed and 
got into bed quickly.
I tried to sleep, but between the smell from next 
door and my fears of my roommate, I lay awake. 
I wondered what he'd be like.
He could be a six foot-two recruit for the basket­
ball team. Dumb athelete, I thought. But if I help 
him with his schoolwork, and later he became 
famous and got his own sportswear and sporting 
equipment lines, I'd rate 20% off. Then I came to 
my senses. They don't stick jocks in rooms like 
mine.
Then again, he could be a nerd or some other 
kind of screwhead who'll spend all his time 
studying. Then why did I bring my TV set? He'll 
want quiet while I'll want Charlie's Angels and
he'll get it and I'll love them...but I never had 
them to start with, anyway.
Neh, I won't get a roommate like that either, I 
said to myself. With my luck, I'll get one of these 
"trendy" types. Not that they intimidate me: like 
a better-looking-than me jock, or a smarter-than- 
me nut; they're just annoying. I can see it now: 
his wandering Jew creeping up my sheets; granola 
crumbs stuck in my underwear drawer; High 
Times on the ceiling and a skateboard to trip over 
on the floor.
I could get a slob, but I'd throw his stuff out the 
window and get arrested and I wouldn't have him 
for a roommate anymore and in prison I know 
what I'd get. Or it could be like the Harrad 
experiment — but that was only a novel. 
I still couldn't sleep and now I was really wor­
rying. What if we don't get along? They tell you 
to be assertive with your roommate, but I've 
never been good at being a bitch, and with my 
luck he'd be a spoiled rotten bastard, so we'd 
probably think of each other as S.O.B.'s, which I 
guess would make us brothers, and for that kind 
of shit, I could go back to my room at home.
Well, by then it was 4 AM, and as I was thinking, 
worse yet, what if we get along and he steals 
Ariselda from me; the garbage man woke every­
one up emptying the dumpster. Soon after, they 
started work on the dorm across the street and by 
then it was 10 A.M. I started to quiver, a key was 
in the key hole, turning...
No, it wasn't the funny farm coming to take me 
away. Actually, it was another freshman N and N 
major (new and nervous) from Schenectady, N.Y. 
He brought the same kind of stuff I did, he had to 
be normal. No granola, no tennis balls, and not 
many books(better yet, he brought a Glade 
Air-conditioner).
"What's your name," I asked him. *
"Simon Goodfellow."
Well, with a name like Simon, he's got to be a 
good fellow.

The New, Condensed, 11-100's 
SUBJECT (ION) Series
REQUIRED, for all Freshmen Faculty Members
The 11-100's series is not mentioned in the regu­
lar Course Description Booklet (probably just "an 
oversight"), but due to its important nature (suc­
cessful completion of the Subject (ion) series is 
now a pre-requisite to attaining tenure on the 
CMU faculty), the TARTAN has agreed to in­
clude the following course description of the ser­
ies.
The 11-100's series is committed to the dream of 
producing a competent faculty body at CMU. It 
consists of three independent (but intimately in- 
ter-woven) courses: 11-101 (lecture), 11-102 (self 
paced), and 11-103 (laboratory). (All classes are 
limited to no more than 1000 participants). They 
will be offered, for your convenience, at the fol­
lowing times and places:

FreshmanImpression
by Mory Brenner
I arrived here a freshman at Carnegie Tech,
With my mother in tears and my father a wreck.
We rode in a wagon filled right to the racks,
With two trunks, seven boxes, and sixteen odd 
sacks.
We'd been cramped in that Buick, twelve hours or 
more,
With no room L,r my sister who stayed on the 
floor.
For the seats were all filled with my clothes and 
my tapes,
A fan and a stereo and a cold bag of grapes,
A T.V., and my bike, and my fine art supplies,
Some cream for my zits, and some drops for my 
eyes,
Four lamps and some books and of course my 
guitar,
An oven, a fridge—that's just inside the car!
On the top my essentials, a road sign from home,
A still, and an iron, an antique French phone,
Nine rhinestone collars, brass rails for my bed,
And to go with my collars, my great dane named 
Fred.
I shall never forget my arrival at school,
And the stares that I got as we brought in my 
pool.
I shall never forget the events of that day,
Nor the pain in his scream when Fred bit the 
R.A.
As he went into shock, with his face turning blue, 
The nurse acted quickly, "Coricidins for you!"
I left him in silence, as he clutched to his cross. 
Then I went to my room, 'twas a triple in Boss.
An E.E. who was poor, and an artist who's rich. 
One gay, and one whimp, I'll not say which is 
which.
I soon became settled with things running just 
fine,
So I set out for Morewood, "a great place to 
dine."

11-101 Subject (ion) I (otherwise known as "The 
Art of the Lecture") will include many standard 
features. The lecturer will speak (mutter) only in 
Latin. (S)he will hold chalk in left hand, eraser in 
right, and never quit using either of them (or vice- 
versa if instructor is left-handed). All classes will 
begin five minutes early and end two blackboards 
after the lecturer says, "Just one more brief point 
I'd like to mention." Tests will be thoroughly un­
related to lecture material (actually, they will be 
Playboy/Playgirl questionnaires). A filmstrip will 
be shown every other week; it will be the 4th ep­
isode of "How to Train Your Goldfish."
11-102 Subject (ion) II (otherwise known as 
"The Art of Getting By") will include many stan­
dard features. The textbook will not be available 
in the bookstore (because no one knows its 
name).
The instructor will also be unavailable (as the 
name and office number of this professor will not 
be revealed until after the end of the semester—
Hamburgers are made from the librarian's cats,
And the leftovers used there to kill off the rats.
For dessert here they serve us a large greenish 
prune,
Which was probably left from a dinner last June.
Then I wasted my time with a three hour poll,
And soon it was Tuesday, and time to enroll.
Though I got all my courses by pure chance and 
luck,
I spent hours in lines, as the deans passed the 
buck.
So, God I've arrived here at old C.M.U.
I'm a freshman you see, so at college I'm new.
questions and compliments may be addressed to 
"The Instructor, 11-102" and sent via campus 
mail). There will be ten quizzes (assistants will be 
available for administering quizzes only on Satur­
day afternoons), each of which may be taken any 
number of times. Participants must pass at least 
eight of these quizzes (although not necessarily 
eight different quizzes).
11-103 Subject (ion) III (otherwise known as 
"The Art of the Fudge Factor" will include many 
standard features. Participants will be required to 
buy official CMU lab/computation notebooks; all 
notations in these lab-books should be made in 
crayon. Pre-labs and write-ups are to be handed in 
(for grading) at least two days before the corre­
sponding laboratory exercise is performed; at 
least 90% of all write-ups should be devoted to 
"sources-of-error" Participants will be given the 
opportunity to duplicate many classic experi­
ments (with the original equipment). They may 
choose from an extensive collection of experi­
ments (such as "The Dissection of the Banana" or 
"Ben Franklin's Famous Key-Kite Exp." (weather 
permitting). Each participant will also be required 
to design and execute an original term-project 
suitable for publication in The Journal of Irrepro- ,¦> 
duclble Results.
My R.A.'s still layed up, and Fred's broken my 
pool.
My typewriter's sticky, but everything's cool.
Cause I know if I'm sick, "stay away from the 
nurse!"
And barring a plague here, things can't get much 
worse.
But I'll soon be adjusted, then right in the groove,
Then sit back in my chair, and I'll watch things 
improve.
Just a little more help please is all that I pray,
I'm scared shitless, you see, my first class is 
today.

Poor Brad
by Rick Kubinski
Brad Dour is a freshman at Carnegie-Mellon 
) University. Brad has high hopes for a "fun" time 
down at good old CMU. Poor Brad. Why poor 
Brad? Well, let's look at what Brad was going 
through and find out.
Brad Dour came here on Sept. 3. He ap­
proached the Morewood desk, and entered into a 
discussion with the desk attendant.
"Your room?" She asked.
"820" he replied.
"Great," she said, "but Morewood E only has 
7 floors."
"It does?"
"Yeah. Listen, go get your letter with the room 
assignment." Brad went out and got it, and sure 
enough, he wasn't blind. The card said 820.
"Well," the attendant said, "I'm afraid you'll 
have to go over THERE!!" And she pointed a 
I quivering finger in the direction of that room of 
horrors, where, so far, 16 people have entered, 
never to come back; the housing office! Poor 
Brad.
Brad explained his problem to the secretary, 
who promptly ushered him into Robert Heath's 
office. Ole Bob was sitting at his desk, looking 
important while he ate his hot pastrami on rye 
r (which is very difficult to do, in case you haven't 
tried it).
"Whaddya want?"
"Well, it seems that I've been put in E tower; 
820."
"So, you want a medal or something?"
"No, it's just that there are only 7 floors in E 
tower."
"Huh? Oh yeah. Right. I knew that. . . . Well, 
i what do you expect me to do about it?"
"I'd appreciate a room with a roof and walls,
ya know?"
"Well, can't you see we're busy around here? 
I've got a million things to do. Why I don't even 
have time for lunch!"
"But you're eating it."
"What?"
"Lunch."
"I am? Oh, yeah, right. I knew that. Well, a 
man needs something to keep him going!! Listen, 
did you talk to the lady out there?"
"Yeah, she's the one who sent me in here."
"Oh. Well, let me see your letter. Hmmmmm. 
Well, it sure says 820, doesn't it? Well, go have a 
seat outside, and I'll see if I can find a room for 
you in my files here."
Well Brad managed to eat half a candy ma­
chine, take a nap and go to the bathroom three 
times while he waited for Bob's speedy service. 
Finally Mr. Heath called him in.
"You're in luck. I've found something for you 
the basement of Webster Hall."
"Websjer Hall? Where's that?" Poor, poor, 
poor Brad.
Brad got to Webster, took one look at the base­
ment and came back to Bob Heath. After another 
hour of point-blank argueing (Brad made the 
point, and Heath looked blank), Brad was saved 
more anguish by taking a last second cancellation 
in 502 E.
Brad settled in there and on Sept. 6, according 
to his red enrollment card, began his registration 
at the Gym. Things started off great. His I.D. pic­
ture came out fine. But all good things must come 
to an end and soon Brad had to go upstairs for 
actual enrollment.
First he went to information and said he 
needed to add a course. They sent him to Station
1. But he hadn't filled out a form. Bingo! Twenty 
minutes down the tubes looking for the magic 
signatures. Back he came. But the information 
desk had accidentally taken his red card, and the 
guys at the front entrance didn't believe that he 
was coming at the right time. Finally he fought
his way up to the top. He got past Station 1. He 
asked Station 2 what they wanted and they said, 
nothing. He went to Station 3 and was cleared by 
the cashier. But the cashier then noticed he had 
no food contract bill.
"Aren't you on food contract."
"Yeah, I'm on it."
"Well, not according to you bill, you aren't."
"I'm not?" he sighed. "O.K. the, where do I 
get this straightened out?"
"Station 2."
"I just passed that."
"I know. Go back."
At Station 2 Brad found out that the school 
had not sent him his food contract choices. So he 
filled out a form and got one right there. Then he 
went back to Station 3.
"You owe us 400 dollars."
"But you just cleared me 20 minutes ago!"
"That was before you went back to Station
2."
"So?"
"So they gave you a food contract for 400 
dollars." Brad sighed and got out his check book.
"Make that check out for 420 dollars."
"I thought you said 400 dollars."
"There's a 20 dollars late fee."
"But it wasn't my fault that I didn't pay on 
time."
"Well, let me talk to the head."
After a 30 minute battle Brad won back his 
20 dollar late fee.
Then Brad went to Station 4, who sent him 
back to Station 1 for something or other. Just 
when Brad thought he would never pass go and 
collect 200 dollars, Station 1 whisked him away 
to Station 4, then to Station 4 and finally the free 
world.
Two days later, while looking for the rooms 
where his classes would be held, Brad stopped 
someone, asking him to point out which building 
was Baker and which Porter.
Poor, poor, poor, poor Brad.CAN YOUCUT THE MUSTARD ?

ONE ON ONE IS NONE ON NONE
A film review 
Film: One on One 
Writer: Robby Benson 
Producer: Warner Bros.
M5 J. up dtekl
One on One, a recent Rocky revisited 
where a basketball replaces the gloves, 
begins with a bang and slowly dribbles 
itself into the predictable comers. This 
is rather a frail film with no aesthetic 
value whatsoever. They took the Rocky 
script, changed the names, changed the 
sport, changed the location, slapped on 
a new title and shoved it into the pro­
jectors all-over the country in hopes of 
cashing in on some of those Rocky riches. 
Despite its plagiaristic nature, One on 
One does manage to have some moments, 
marginal as they may be. But on the
whole it is a tawdry rejuvenation of Rocky 
hurriedly shot and distributed before the 
Rocky fad could become just another flash 
in the pan.
The story begins in Golorado where 
Henry Steele, an under six foot basket­
ball player who is still in high school, 
is being courted by the big time college 
sports. Western University, a fictitious 
institutuion which was created for this 
film but looking a lot like UCLA, offers 
him the largest scholarship plus the usual 
under the table benefits and seduces him 
into playing for their school. Credulous 
little Henry moves to California and thus 
begins his rites of passage into adulthood.
This is when the film’s structure begins 
to resemble a punctured basketball that 
slowly begins to lose its air as it gets 
tossed around. Steele soon learns of the 
unethical practices of a competitive sports
familiar to you Rocky fans? As an actor, 
Benson is totally winning. As a writer, 
he could use some coaching. Why would 
someone with his obvious wealth of talent 
fritter away his time trying to raise a 
genre film into the realm of art? He 
must have more creative ambitions that 
are his own. His script has no priorities. 
It goes for the quickest laugh available 
...and usually gets it. This includes lots 
of toilet humor, which seems to be the 
going thing today.
All aspects of this loser film about 
a supposed winner seem to be deficient. 
Most of the sequences are underdeveloped. 
Characters we expect to see more of drop 
out of the picture before they even get a 
chance to fulfill their duty. What happened 
to the hitch hiker who threatened to 
scream rape at the beginning? What 
about the manager’s nymphomaniac sec­
retary? The characters never solidify. 
The relationships never click.

school which is willing to do anything and 
pay anyone to win the game. He also 
learns quickly that the powers of the mind

of the body and he begins to divide his 
time evenly between his intellectual 
and physical advancement. This leads 
to a major decay of his ability with the 
ball, and the team’s management requests 
that he give up his atheletic scholarship. 
Steele refuses. They then begin to take 
steps to force him into capitulation. 
They set-up tests of his endurance. They 
wear him down, pounding him to a pulp. 
But our old underdog Henry Steele per­
severes.
Ronny Benson wrote the script around 
himself and supplied a juicy role for 
himself in the lead. Does that sound
But here we are seeing the fall of Henry 
Steele; the fall of the idealist into the 
cynic arms of the system. But he wins 
in spite of his fall. In the final moments 
of the film he is sent in for an injured 
player and wins the important game for 
his team. But wait. This is not yet e- 
nough. Henry is due his sufficient revenge. 
The last scene finds Henry in the man­
ager’s office. The coach is complimenting 
him on his performance with the ball 
in their final seconds of need. Here it 
comes. Steele gets to tell him off. Ah, 
sweet revenge. But not only is Steele 
telling him off, we're telling him off. 
The film ends and we can return to our 
homes with a great feeling of relief and 
satisfaction.
The film was made to look low budget 
on purpose. This might be the beginning 
of a whole new genre for movies. There 
might be a rebirth of the American pro­
tagonist. The box office take from Rocky 
was so great that they might start tailor­
ing them all to look the image to the 
loser film in hopes that these films, like 
their heros, will win in the end against 
all possible odds.

DIAMOND DOT IN FRAT LAND
A book review 
Book: Diamond Dot and 
the Fraternity 
Author: Dorothy Wyman 
Publisher: Gator Press
by Sarah Diamond
Dorothy Wyman spent 1950 to 1966 as 
housemother of CMU’s Sigma Nu frater­
nity, and according to the foreword of 
her book, Diamond Dot and The Frater­
nity, they were 16 “hilarious, happy, and 
often touching years.” I will have to take 
Mrs. Wyman’s word for it, because her 
book doesn’t show this to be so.
books
The tone of the book is set with the 
first line of the foreword: “No one could 
ever accuse Dorothy Wyman of having her 
generation gap showing.” Things go down­
hill from here as cliches and cuteness are 
mashed together to exemplify juvenile 
humor.
I feel like a heel speaking this way 
about a book by a woman who was loved 
and admired by many. When she retired, 
Earle Swank, then Dean of Men, presented 
her with the Carnegie Medal. Her heart 
may have been in her work, but her skill 
isn’t in her writing.
Episode after episode is related with a 
laughable lack of subtlety that must be 
blamed largely on Betsy Bates Zeiss, the 
co-author. When one opens the book 
at random, profundities seem to leap up 
from the pages:
“Judging from the hoots and hollers and 
snorting that emanated from the ballroom,
I would have to acclaim it a roaring suc­
cess.”
“confusion was rife”
“It’s folly to have an animal that might 
be diseased and that is destructive besides.” 
“The adventure struck everyone’s

funnybone and we were hilarious with such 
gay humor that the rest of the walk home 
seemed like nothing.”
Proof enough?
The book makes no claim to greatness: 
Diamond Dot is an 85-page pamphlet, 
published by the Gator Press of Cape 
Coral, Florida. Obviously, it is a personal 
memoir written for Mrs. Wyman and
HOW DO YOU THINK MOST PEOPLE YOUR AGE DIE?
It’s not drugs.
It’s not suicide.
And it’s not cancer.
It’s automobile crashes.
More American people 
between the ages of 15 and 25 die 
in automobile crashes than in any 
other way.
At least half of those deaths 
are alcohol related. And the drunk 
drivers who cause most of them 
are under 25. Sometimes, many 
times, they kill themselves.
One of the most dangerous 
things you can do is get drunk and 
drive home.
You can change it. You 
have to.
You march against the war.
those close to her. In this aim, the book 
probably succeeds. To the general reader, 
however, the book is a dismal failure. Too 
many adjectives get in the way of the 
anecdotes, and we are left yearning for 
details—anything that will help us appre­
ciate an episode as much as Mrs. Wyman 
did.
The biggest problem with the book, 
after the writing, is the lack of depth. 
There is no continuity through the 16 
years, and we have no sense of time or 
historical perspective. We never get to 
know the brothers; names are dropped 
with no consideration for the bewildered 
reader. Mrs. Wyman comes across as 
shallow too; her good ole moralizing and 
quaint homilies are stilted and ineffec­
tive.
In spite of these drawbacks, the time 
required to read the book makes it worth 
the effort. A few historical facts emerge 
from the mire, and people presently
affiliated with CMU or Sigma Nu will 
be interested in reading about Dean 
Swank’s early days, Bob Morgan, and 
Barbara Feldon, and learning that before 
the creation of Fraternity Quadrangle, 
Sigma Nu occupied the Chalfant mansion, 
a 36-room Georgian Colonial.
Life in a college fraternity, if it was 
more interesting then than it is now, is 
certainly a worthwhile topic for a book. 
To make this book worthwhile, all Mrs. 
Wyman needs is a new collaborator. One 
who has a sense of historical perspective 
and can sift through the rubble, (“He Shot 
me a pathetic glance”), to find the gold 
would be greatly appreciated.
In the meantime, collect $3.95 from 
some friends, buy the book, and read it 
aloud to each other some weekend night 
when there’s nothing happening on campus 
except for the usual mixers.
Diamond Dot and The Fraternity is now 
on sale at the CMU bookstore.
You fight for clean air and clean 
water. You eat natural foods. You 
practice yoga. You are so much for 
life. And you are so much against 
killing.
It would be unthinkable for 
you to wittingly kill another human 
being.
So then, why is this 
happening?
