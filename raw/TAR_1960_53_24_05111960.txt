Food Service 
To Be Handled 
By Stouffers
At the cornerstone laying cere- 
,mony held last Friday at the site 
of the new Student Activities Cen­
ter, President Warner made the 
announcement that the Stouffer 
Corporation will manage food 
services at Carnegie Tech starting 
June 12.
A familiar name to Pittsburgh­
ers through their operation of 
several restaurants in the city, 
Stouffer’s will supervise campus- 
wide food service facilities through 
their Management Food Services 
Division in Philadelphia. A Resi­
dent Manager will coordinate the 
preparation and serving of some 
5,500 meals daily on the Car­
negie Tech campus.
Focal point of the new pro­
gram will be the new Activities 
Center where 4,000 meals will be 
served daily to students and fac­
ulty starting in the fall. Students 
will be served in a large cafeteria, 
faculty in a new faculty club ax-ea, 
and special luncheon and dinner 
groups will be accommodated in 
private dining rooms.
Over 1,300 meals will be serv­
ed to the residents of Morewood 
Gardens, and 280 meals daily will 
be prepared at Mudge Graduate 
House.
Warner, Bovard, and Chaiken 
Officate F riday At Center’s 
Cornerstone Ceremony
On Friday afternoon of Spring Carnival, the Cornerstone 
laying ceremony was held at the site of the new Student Ac­
tivities Center. Officiating at the ceremony were President 
Warner, Mr. James Bovard; Chairman of the Board of
Trustees, and Jan Chaiken; Presi-#-------------------------------———----------------—
dent of Student Congress. Follow­
ing speeches made by Dr. Warner,
Mr. Bovard, and Jan Craiken, the 
copper box containing a collection 
of campus publications was placed 
in the concrete stone and the cor­
nerstone was sealed into place.
Coming in the midst of the an­
nual Spring Carnival weekend at 
Carnegie Tech, the cornerstone- 
laying ceremonies had special sig­
nificance for students since the 
Center is essentially a student fa­
cility, offering food services, rec­
reation facilities, a ballroom for 
dances, meeting rooms for campus : 
organizations, editorial offices for 
student publications, religious af- Warner officiate at the cornerstone

Draft
If you are planning to con­
tinue your education during 
the academic year. 1960-61, 
whether here at CIT or some 
other institution and you are 
under the jurisdiction of Se­
lective Service regulations, 
you should consult and care­
fully read the informative no­
tice which is posted on cam­
pus and dormitory bulletin 
boards. As the registrant of a 
local board, it is your ob­
ligation to attend to this very 
important item of personal 
business at once.

President’s Report for the year 
1958-59, the Controller’s report J 
for the same period, and the De­
velopment Program Report, out­
lining progress of Tech’s $29,000,-
000 development program.
James Bovard, Chairman of the ’ 
Board of Trustees, Dr. J. C. War­
ner, President of Carnegie Tech, 
and Jan Chaiken, President of 
Student Congress, made brief re­
marks at the ceremonies.
Predictions 
The following are the predic­
tions made by the members of 
Executive Council and enclosed in 
the cornerstone:
“Sixty-seven hundred yards due 
east of a large crater, which has 
replaced the Monnogahela-Alle­
gheny river junction, a bleak hill 
overlooks the former greenery of 
some unknown park. While the 
hill’s broken buildings have been 
cleared away, one is still able to 
make out a seventy-odd acre plot 
and sense its former glory. What 
was once here is not too positively 
known, but it probably was of 
military significance. Why else 
would it have been extended to 
such sub-levels?” ,
James Powers 
“Carnegie Institute of Technol­
ogy and the University of Pitts-j 
burgh, forsaking ancient rivalries.
ficial hopes we could wish for 
| you . . . that you live in an ad­
vanced world and age of civiliza­
tion that can, and will only, de­
velop from the peaceful use of 
that which we are discovering 
now.”
Jan Notopoulos 
“Frankly I do not anticipate any 
major change in the fraternity 
idea at Carnegie Tech. There will 
be changes of a minor nature, but 
the desire of men to band together 
with strong ties such as in a 
fraternity, for their reaction and 
work either at college or away, 
will always remain. And so will 
the fraternity.”
Paul Farrell 
“In 2060, there will be offered 
accredited courses in the major re­
ligions which will be taught by 
clergymen and controlled by the 
school. The late hour debates in 
the dorms will not be concerned 
with birth control and the influ­
ence on religion on one’s political 
career but will ask the following 
question:
1. Do people in space have 
souls?
2. If he has a soul, does it have 
a need for the religions now on 
earth or is it above the soul of 
earth men?

the final meeting of this academic 
. year. Picnickers will meet at the 
First Unitarian Church (corner of 
Ellsworth and Morewood) at 1:30

lowship that should be a “must” 
on your busy calendar.
INSTEP Picnic
The next Y Forum w.ill be com­
bined with a picnic with INSTEP 
students on Thursday, May 12th. 
The forum starting at 4:30 at the 
Carnegie Union will be a student 
panel presenting ideas for dis­
cussion on pedestiration, free will 
and determinism.
Cars will leave at 5:45 for the 
covered picnic stand in Schenley 
Park Oval. After picnic supper, 
entertainment will include a de­
monstration baseball game (with 
simplified equipment) so the In­
dian students can learn the prin­

watching the Pirates; and a de­
monstration of Indian music with 
real instruments. A nominal fee 
will be charged to cover food 
costs. The Y office needs to know by Wednesday the names of any 
who plan to come to the picnic to 
plan food and transportation. In 
case of rain the picnic will be

“I believe that the future of ac­
tivities at Carnegie Tech will 
closely resemble the past. Stu­
dents need some form of mental 
challenge outside of their studies, 
and activities fill this role. Fur­
thermore, human beings are gen­
erally a gregarious lot. One likely 
change, however, is that the Ex­
ecutive Council of Student Con­
gress will probably be voted out of 
existence if its decisions remain so 
unpopular with the masses."
Timothy McGuire 
“In 2060: Teaching methods will 
rely heavily on mechanical de- 
Tices and will be based on new 
developments in psychology. Also, 
the number ae departments at Car­
negie Tech will be greatly in­
creased, and all will be co-educa- 
ttonal.”
Margaret Spock 
*1 doubt that there will be any 
women’s fraternities on the cam­
pus of Carnegie Tech in the year 
2060, as I believe this school will 
|>ecome one of all male enrollment 
except perhaps in the college of 
dramatics. In the colleges where 
sororities will exist, however, I 
feel that sororities shall hare a 
very strong influence on the cam­
pus as well as in the politics of the 
United States.”

International Club
Dr. Cottrell will speak to the 
club at the last meeting for this 
semester. We are fortunate in 
having such a distinguished 
speaker, but due to “security 
regulations” we are unable to re­
lease the topic of his discussion.
The meeting will be held in the 
Carnegie Union on Sunday, May 
15, at 8:00 p.m.
Newman Club
The Day school and Evening 
school Newman Clubs will co­
sponsor a testimonial dinner for 
their faculty advisor, Dr. Rossini, 
who is leaving Tech to head the 
Chemistry Department at Notre 
Dame University.
The dinner will be held at the 
Jacktown Hotel, Route 30, near 
Irwin, on Sunday, May 15. The 
cost is $4.50 a person. Tickets may 
be purchased from any Newman 
Club member, or in Mr. McKel- 
way’s office. There will be car 
pools from Cardinal Newman 
Hall for anyone in need of trans­
portation.

Dear Editors:
I am a Carnegie Tech coed: not
A Challenge
a “Bohemian” dramat or P & D, 
jjjor yet a female Einstein, but a 
demure, ladylike Maggie Murph. 
My dwelling place is beautiful 
Morbid Gardens where purity and 
innocence reign supreme. Realize, 
please, that I am not a Lolita 
nor a Hester Prynne, but merely 
a normal young woman. How­
ever, I was very excited and 
thrilled when last May a 
%£»roup (or “mob” as some have 
put it) decided to have open house 
in dear old M.G. And I was not 
alone. As a matter of fact, all of 
the young ladies on my floor, very 
respectable with untarnished rep­
utations they were and still are, 
wished that said young men would 
succeed in their endeavor. Why? 
Not because they wanted to en­
gage in orgies or Bacchanalian 
^revels, but merely for the sake of 
some much needed excitement. 
Those who had been here for the 
previous “panty raid” were just 
as enthusiastic as the others. And 
this could very well have been 
kept out of the newspapers (al­
though my parents and those of 
many other students would have 
thought it great fun and wished 
they could have been in on it).The Situation
* Here is the situation: young men  ----_-------------------——--------
Raids
are outside trying to get in, while 
young ladies hope that they do, 
not for any indecent or destructive 
purposes, let me make that clear, 
but for some good clean fun—as 
it were, playing cops and robbers 
with the harem guards. But in­
stantly, the administration sics the 
gendarmes on participants and 
bystanders alike. In the mean­
time the coeds, all stirred up are 
told to draw all shades, close all 
windows, and (oh impossible 
task!) forget about the Gallahads 
and Launcelots outside, complete­
ly contrary to their desires and to 
human nature, on pain of campus. 
(And they wonder why there’s 
apathy on the campus!)
While pinmates are being as­
saulted and battered and dates are 
receiving black eyes (most unbe­
coming) by the Pittsburgh Chapter 
of N.K.V.D., their benevolent moth­
er and father images are parading 
around writing the numbers of 
all rooms with shades raised high­
er than 1/16 inches, ready to cam­
pus any feaful child who peeps out 
to learn the fate of her one and 
only (or even the clod who is 
taking her out that weekend, for who wants to lose her only hope?) 
Then the day long arm of the law 
hauls in innocent bystanders, 
without touching those who are
equally guilty, if not more so: 
the girls who mentally if not voc­
ally encouraged those wha be- 
seiged the castle. How unfair!
Just Fun
The point of my epistle is this: 
these demonstrations are a matter 
o* youth exuberance, spring fever, 
and adventurous nature (which is 
evidently a factor »which every 
day the dear faculty and admin­
istration attempt to blot out of 
their students’ souls). The idea 
was very simple: the boys just 
wanted to get in, showing re­
sourcefulness.
We no longer have enchanted 
princesses imprisoned in castle 
dungeons, and the only sub­
stitute is a dormitory of co­
eds. The girls also loved the 
thought of men racking their 
brains to pass the obstacles and be 
where their “belles dames” are, 
which is most definitely an under­
taking one never sees any more. 
We were Isoldes, imprisoned by 
dragons (no offense, housemoth­
ers), and our Tristans were try­
ing to come to us. It was as sim­
ple as that—just a good time for 
all. But no, said a few men of im­
portance (but evidently not of dis­
tinction). So now all our chances 
for a little fun and excitement are 
gone, so we are apathetic.
The school neither understands 
nor tries to. Therefore, I wish to 
mention a woman’s feeling on this 
matter. We did not and do hot 
wish to be protected and any par­
ent who, hearing of the episode, 
decides to send darling Millicent 
or Pency to P.U. instead of C.I.T. 
shouldn’t have considered sending 
them to an institution where the 
individuals want to remain indi­
viduals. Thank you, deans, but 
we most certainly did not ap­
preciate your assistance on this 
matter. We can think for our­
selves. We wish for a reversal of 
your actions. After all, we’re only 
human, or would you prefer ro­
bots?
NAME WITHHELD
Editor, The Tartan:
The Tartan has never risen to 
the heights of j5urnalistic excel­
lence and editorial brilliance, but 
even during the Blenheim regime 
it somehow managed to retain a 
level above that of its most re­
cent issue.
I have no cause to find fault 
with the inclusion of Norman 
Cousin’s recent editorial that ap­
peared in The Saturday Review; 
this is your right. But allow me to 
carry this right a step further. As 
editors of a college newspaper you 
should have then assumed the 
added duty of reflecting some sort 
of thought representative of some 
segment of the college community 
—you must have some (any!!!) 
opinion. Small-minded and insipid 
introductory comments never con­
stitute editorial comment. If Mr. 
Cousin’s notes are perinent to this 
campus, I would like to know pre­
cisely where. This may take a 
little courage on your part, and 
perhaps some risk of being com­
pletely wrong, but, after all, this 
is the reason you accepted the post 
of editor. So much for your fail­
ure; let us examine Mr. Cousin’s world.
Stroll on American Campos
Mr. Cousins begins his article 
with the admission that his sam­
ple of American colleges is a poor 
one; then he proceeds to make an 
iron-bound case for his own per- 
ticular prejudice. It is true that 
there is a gap between the inter­
ested and the disinterested stu­
dent; that many students view col­
lege as only an income multiplier 
and that the superficial concern 
with science centers about compe­
tition with Russia.
Are we to believe in his defi­
nition of what makes up the in­
terested and the disinterested? It 
seems to me that it would be easy 
to make a case for the person, who 
follows lectures and knows what 
books to read, as being an intel­
lectual clod—a person who lacks 
sufficient discrimination and na­
tive intelligence to trust his own 
judgment. At best this is only a 
half-truth, but we all know well- 
educated persons who have lost 
their ability to think without the
aid of predigested opinions. It 
might be that Mr. Cousin’s sample 
only included those who attended 
his lectures; thus, he might have 
missed those who would want to 
do their own thinking apart from 
the swarming cultivators of proper 
opinions.
Proper Research?
Years ago there was a gentle­
man’s C; now, with a great deal 
more effort, the same gentleman 
requires a B in order to face the 
outside world. Neither aspect of 
the gentleman has appeal, but at 
least some learning must rub off 
with the B. On evidence as good 
as Mr. Cousin’s, I can conclude 
that our students are better off 
now—and be just as wrong. I am 
certain that Mr. Cousins never 
went farther than the outside of 
the scientific laboratories to find 
his concern with Soviet competi­
tion as being the motivating force 
behind our scientists. Perhaps a 
short time spent with a few sci­
entists would reward his search 
for the thoroughly committed 
modern man, a man who has faith 
enough in his own work to keep 
his eyes and earns open to the rest 
of the world. Part of the blind­
ness of the public support for sci­
ence is reflected in the opacity of 
Mr. Cousin’s own eyes. His case 
against the scientific attitude built 
on the enthusiasm of a college 
sophomore (who, from the com­
ments he made, should have been 
home studying) is painful; it de­
molishes any case that he could 
have reasonably presented against this attitude.
Bias Evident
The thought behind this article 
is valid; the bias, insisting on one 
conclusion and one attitude, ruins 
the validity as well as the sense 
of the argument. I would suggest 
C. P. Snow’s The Two Cultures as 
required reading for Mr. Cousins 
if he ever wants to continue this 
analysis.
Perhaps our world is different 
from that of our fathers, but our 
poor bungling sophomore comes 
closer to realizing this than does 
Mr. Cousins, even with all his ex­
perience and erudition. Questions

ATO Wins Buggy, 
PKT Takes Design
Always a highlight to the 
Spring Carnival weekend, the an­
nual buggy races again caught the 
interest of the Tech campus. Dis­
qualified last year, ATO came on 
strong to defeat an able dorm 
crew and a sleek PiKA racer with 
a winning time of 2:34.5. All the 
buggies were skwed down by the 
wet course. There was little doubt 
as to the final outcome after the 
preliminary races which ATO won 
easily in 2.27 on a dry course.
Preliminary Heat
PiKA placed second in the pre- 
| liminary heats with a time of 
i 2:32.4 but dropped nearly 10 sec­
onds in the finals crossing the 
finish line in 2:41.8. Wheel trouble 
might have been responsible for 
part of this. The Dorm buggy 
suffered least from the poor con­
dition of the course in the finals 
and dropped only .6 seconds from 
their 2:35.4 preliminary time to 
2:36.

placed second. The Phi Kap’s

With Conference Meet Saturday
Tech’s track season will end 
this week a dual meet at home 
against Westminster this after­
noon, and the conference meet at 
Westminster on Saturday. Today’s 
meet at 3:30 on the Schenley Oval 
treke will give the home runners 
a glimpse of the team that is ex­
pected to repeat as West Penn 
champs. The Titans are unde­
feated in conference dual meets 
this year.
Total Loss
Coach Birdy took his squad to 
Geneva for a meet last week and 
the team was soundly trounced, 
93-38.
One bright spot stood out, how­
ever. Dennis Gary, a freshman 
performing in only his second 
meet, came from behind to win 
the 100 in :10.3, and also took the 
220 by a wide margin in :22.6. 
With a slight improvement on 
these times Saturday Gary should 
place among the area’s top sprint­
ers.
Furman Smith was pressed hard 
in the 120 low hurdles, but won in 
a fast :13.9. Jim Sharkey was 
Tech’s only other winner, with a 
high jump of 5-9.
Bruce Dobras, who was nomi­
nated as this year’s co-captain 
along with John Klasnic, pulled a 
leg muscle and finished second in 
the mile run to Geneva’t Jim Wil­
son.
