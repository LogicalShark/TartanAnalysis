CARNEGIE TECH LOSES GOOD 
GAME TO WESTINGHOUSE.
Score—23 to 20.
On Friday afternoon, December 16, 
the Westinghouse Club gymnasium 
in Wilkinsburg was the scene of the 
first basketball contest of the ’Versity 
five. Although our boys were worsted, 
the score of 23 to 20, shows that the 
game was anything but a walk-away 
for our hosts..
The Westinghouse Club, boasting of 
a membership of three hundred or 
more employes of the manufacturing 
company of that name, is an organiza­
tion that is becoming well-known 
throughout the country. Ninety per 
cent, of the members are graduates of 
various colleges and universities, 
which puts the team representing 
them on an, intercollegiate basis, as 
far as membership is concerned. Their 
team is big, but by- no means slow, 
and a lively session was opened up 
for the benefit of the spectators.
Almost every one of the Westing­
house non-contestants was accom­
panied by one or more ladies, and the 
gallery was filled with fair faces. Our 
fair rooters were not numerous, but 
the noise-makers were very much in 
evidence, especially in the second half, 
when, under the leadership of Seigle, 
every play was greeted with cheers.
Carnegie opened the game with a 
rush, passing the ball swiftly and ac­
curately down the floor, until Douth- 
ett w§s able to shoot the first goal of 
the game from directly beneath the 
basket. The Westinghouse Club then 
woke up and Hansell and Lyford each 
scored a field goal. Lyford’s shot was 
a pretty single-handed one over his 
head. Both teams then settled down 
to fast floor-work shooting only oc­
casionally. Hall drew a round of ap­
plause by taking the ball near the 
center of the floor and shooting a 
clean goal from that position. The 
half ended with the score 13 to 10 
against us.
In the second period, both teams 
showed up to a marked degree, dis­
playing speed only often enough to 
keep the interest of the spectators in 
tension. Lyford did all of the scor­
ing for his team in this period, making 
10 points on 4 goals from the floor, 
and two goals from free throws.. With 
five minutes to play, Simpson was 
sent in for Williams and Savage for 
Heisel. The two fresh men renewed 
the speed of the game and two field 
goals were shot in this interval by 
our men, and another goal was in pro­
cess of making when the gong ended 
the game.
Hall starred for our five in the first 
period, and Colvin and Douthett di­
vided honors in the second half. Wil­
liams played a good game and will

ANNUAL CHRISTMAS PARTY. 
Director and Mrs. Hamerschlag En­
tertain All Students Unable to 
Get Home for Holidays.
On Christmas evening all the stu­
dents who were unable to get home 
for their vacation were invited to the 
home of Dr. and Mrs. Hamerschlag 
at 4040 Grant boulevard, to have a 
little Christmas celebration of their 
own. Judging from the number of 
students who passed in and out dur­
ing the evening, all those remaining 
in Pittsburgh accepted the kind invi­
tation. It was estimated that nearly 
every state in the Union and many for­
eign countries were represented in the 
gathering.
It was not a formal affair at all, 
but gotten up to pass around a little 
Christmas cheer and entertainment 
to those who for one reason o’r an­
other were kept in the city during the 
holidays—and it succeeded admirably. 
That valuable functionary of the 
butler, acted as a sort of chief magic­
ian much to the delight of all con­
cerned . Under his magic spell, each 
of the guests developed some little 
trick with which to amuse others and 
so pass a very pleasant evening.
This is an annual occurrence and, 
as has been the case in other years, 
th-e students gave a hearty vote of 
thanks to Director and Mrs. Hamer­
schlag for their kindness and thought­
fulness in so helping them to pass 
their Christmas away from home.

DESIGN PLEBES’ BANQUET.
On Monday evening, December 18, 
the Plebes of the School of Applied 
Design held a banquet in the Fort 
Pitt Hotel. The affair was well at­
tended by the men of the class, who 
entertained as their guests Mr. Horn- 
bostel, Dean McGoodwin, and Pro­
fessors Ferrand and Schwab. While 
the event was pulled off without any 
interference of the upperclassmen, it 
was in a measure anticipated by some, 
who give the Plebes unstinted admir­
ation for their management of it, 
since they were unsuspected until late 
afternoon of the day it occurred, even 
at which time the news leaked out 
thru the fault of none of their num­
ber.
The well appointed banquet was fol­
lowed by talks by all the professors 
in attendance. Cleverly done menus 
remain as souvenirs of a much-enjoyed 
and undisturbed evening.

JOINT MEETING OF THE EN­
GINEERING SOCIETIES.
First Ever Held in Carnegie.
The first joint meeting ever held of 
all the Engineering Societies of Car­
negie, took place on Wednesday eve­
ning, the 13th of December. There 
were about 125 men present, filling the 
Heat Lecture Room to overflowing.
The speaker for the evening was 
Mr. Humphreys, the president and 
general manager of the Westinghouse 
Company. His talk was upon “The 
Human Element in Engineering.” He 
told those present, how, from his own 
personal experience, he had learned 
what an economy it was to have con­
sideration for the condition under 
which the ordinary working man lived 
and to make improvements in his con­
dition of living. By teaching a man 
the American language, by teaching 
him hygiene and sanitation, by giving 
him a decent home to live in, a decent 
place to work in and a good place in 
which to spend his leisure hours, Mr. 
Humphreys showed that his efficiency 
would be so much increased that a 
saving would result, and the man who 
did it would be of just as much value 
to a company or corporation as would 
the man, who, by some invention, 
could decrease the coal consumption 
of that concern an appreciable 
amount.
After the lecture lunch and smokes 
were sereved.
This was the first of a series of 
joint meetings of the Engineering So­
cieties. The joint meetings will be 
known as the meetings of the “Fed­
erated Engineering Societies of the 
Carnegie Technical Schools.”
The conditions under which this 
“Federation is organized and under 
which it will operate are given in an­
other place in this issue.

THISTLE BOARD BUSY.
The Thistle Board made great 
progress during the Christmas recess. 
At the meeting held during the vaca­
tion, the editorial work was outlined 
and each member of the Board was 
given some work for which they 
would be personally responsible. All 
material, as it is handed in, will be 
turned over to the person in charge 
of that particular department, so that 
no delay will result.
Every person in school now has a 
chance to be rich or famous. Get 
advertisements for the Thistle—there 
is a commission on each one, or get 
your name printed under some sketch 
or grind you have turned in.
The Thistle Board meets in Room 
205 in the Applied Industries Building 
every Wednesday at 7:30 p. m. Stop 
in some nite and see how it is done.
BUILDING NOTES.
Much of General Interest and Im­
portance Going On.
While most of the members of the 
Carnegie family took a rest during 
the two weeks just past, those con­
nected with the Building Department 
apparently did not, for when a Tar­
tan representative saw the Director 
in his office one day last week he had 
many little bits of information of in­
terest to the student-body to tell.
The studies for the new Machinery 
Hall are progressing rapidly and it 
is expected that within thirty days a 
definite announcement of plans can 
be made. This will be of special in­
terest to the Mechanical Engineers 
and to those who have to go to the 
present building for incidental instruc­
tion.
Bids on the new home of the School 
of Applied Design were submitted to 
the Board of Trustees on Tuesday, 
January 2nd. It is expected that op­
erations will begin upon this build­
ing at once. When it is finished the 
Director and his staff will move into 
it.
The plans for the athletic club 
house and gym are also under way. 
As was announced some time ago, 
these will be located under the new 
Morewood avenue entrance. The De­
partment of Public Works and the 
Pittsburgh Councils are now consid­
ering this question of entrance, and 
it is also hoped that things will soon 
be in shape to go ahead on this 
project.
Our very clear and near friend, the 
barn, the home of the old Breakage 
fee, is to depart hence. Such is life! 
The old Anderson house next to the 
present gym is to be remodeled into 
a barn to replace the old one in its 
useful functions. The porch is to be 
removed and this will be an improve­
ment inasmuch as it will enable us 
to obtain a longer view of M. M. C. S. 
as we walk along Woodlawn ave- 
nue.
By the beginning of the next school 
year it is expected that Dean Leete 
will have a new office, one which it 
will be possible to reach without first 
descending to the basement and then 
climbing the stairs. This will be of 
decided value to those of us, if all 
still on deck at that time, who have 
to go there so often and who are not 
blessed with elevator keys.
The Director also remarked that the 
Muddy Trail is still muddy and that 
he looked to the Tartan to make him 
some suggestions as to how to rem- 
1 edy the situation. Now the Tartan, 
at the beginning of the year, made all 
the suggestions it could think'of, but 
is only too willing to attempt to think 
of more. If any of the students using

We hope that it is not too early to 
congratulate the Thistle Board upon 
the manner in which they have under­
taken their arduous duties. In the 
past there has always been more or 
less of a propensity to procrastinate, 
with the net result that the book was 
rushed towards the end to its own 
disadvantage. The present board has 
not shown, to date, any of this in­
clination. The various classes should 
see to it that their representatives 
hand in the class material at the time 
set for that purpose, thus rendering 
valuable assistance to the Board.
At the beginning of last year we 
had in the White Friars what prom­
ised to be a most successful student 
organization. It had produced three 
exceptionally good musical show's 
and we had every reason to look for­
ward to the producing of many more. 
Everything pointed to a brilliant fu­
ture for the club, with a warm place 
secure in the hearts of the student- 
body and the outside public. Through 
some inherent weakness, however, 
either in the organization of the club 
itself or in the management of the 
same, the Friars collapsed utterly in 
the season of 1910-11. The very 
promising play being written for them 
was thrown overboard and what 
should have been, we firmly believe, 
a most golden opportunity, allowed 
to slip through their fingers.
In an editorial in the issue of May 
10th, the Tartan pointed out that no 
reasonable excuse could be offered 
for such a failure since the student 
interest in the organization was great­
er than in any other student organiza­
tion, excepting athletics, and since 
the amount of financial aid rendered , 
by the student activity fund to the 
Friars was larger than that given to
any other single organization at that 
time the Tartan stated that, in its 
belief, the only possible way in which 
to put this club on its feet again would 
be to reorganize from the basement 
up. It would not be right to put life 
into the- old organization without tak­
ing some steps to close the doors 
upon a possible reoccurrence of the 
lamentable failure of last spring.
There is in this institution a need 
and a desire for such an organization 
as the White Friars professed them­
selves to be. There is an exceedingly 
good nucleus around which to build 
and the student interest in the or­
ganization needs only to be wisely 
crystalized to develop into an instru­
ment for the fulfilling of this student 
need. The Tartan would like to see 
steps toward this end taken immedi­
ately, in order that a play may be 
staged this season, and stands ready 
to do anything in its power to bring 
about such activity.
—o—
OUR LEISURE MOMENTS.
A member of the faculty, and he 
was an assistant professor too, ac­
cording to the last catalogue, re­
marked without the slightest inten­
tion of being facetious that, in addi­
tion 'to . our regularly assigned ad­
vance, we could, in our leisure mo­
ments, read carefully from article 34 
on page 46 to article SO on page 69, 
paying especial attention to the de­
rivation of all formulae, since they 
were important.
Ye gods, what are leisure moments? 
Who ever had any of them, pray tell? 
Certainly we never did and we are 
sure, quite certain in fact, that no 
student, except possibly an architect, 
ever caught sight of one. Leisure 
moments, indeed! Can’t the mem­
bers of such an intellectual body as 
the faculty grasp the simple fact that 
the leisure moments are as parrots 
in the School of Applied Design; in 
other words, that “they ain’t?” It 
passeth all understanding, so it do.
Our sometimes humorous contem­
porary, The Harvard Lampoon, has 
evidently undergone a somewhat sim- 
iar experience, for it is led to remark, 
editorially, as follows:
“It is about time to explode a pop­
ular fallacy. Every year, when De­
cember swings frostily around, the 
self-conscious and self-righteous edi­
tors of myriad school and college 
publications seize the unready editor­
ial pen, and write with clock-work 
regularity: ‘Now that the football
season is over, there is a lull in our 
I stormy life. Let us seize this oppor­
tunity for work and outside reading.’ 
The idea is plausible. Thereupon 
every professor, instructor, organiza­
tion, activity, club, society, and in- 
I dividual proceeds to make dates for 
December, in the firm belief that they 
will catch us in the idle moment. Idle 
moment—pisht! In every course 
there is a report due December twen­
tieth, or a thesis due December fif­
teenth or forty-’leven books to read 
by December tenth. Every organiza­
tion with foot-light aspirations rushes 
madly upon the boards. Every other 
organization holds meetings and eats
a perfunctionory Christmas dinner. 
Every Boston, Cambridge, Brookline 
and Chestnut Hill matron invites 
‘idle Harvard’ to sip innocuous tea, to 
gabble and prance and dine and dance 
with the buds. And after it is all over, 
on December twenty-second, a for­
lorn and green-faced individual comes 
sneaking unhappily home, and in­
forms his family that he got D’s on 
his reports.”
Quite so! For once has “Lampy” 
spoken with more truth than humor, 
for about such a situation there 
can be nothing humorous, except pos­
sibly for the “buds,” and for the truth 
we can vouch. Our leisure moments 
forsooth! Away with them! Off with 
their heads! On with the wet towels 
and midnight oil! What care we, for 
such is life in college with the mid­
years three weeks off!
ROOTERS’ NIGHT.
In the issue of the Pitt Weekly 
for December 6th there appeared a 
very will written and straight to the 
point communication on the subject, 
“Rooters’ Night at the Theatre.” It 
was signed “Senior.” That institu­
tions of our standing should indulge 
ill such a contest is the “acme of ab­
surdity,” and it is with pleasure that 
we publish this communication to our 
contemporary for the perusal of the 
student-body in the hope that the 
student-body at Carnegie will join 
with the Tartan in agreeing with the 
students at the university on this sub­
ject.
To the Editor of the Pitt Weekly: 
The so-called cheering contest or 
“rooters’ night,” as arranged by a lo­
cal theater, should not be counten­
anced by the University of Pittsburgh 
in the future. The purpose is one of 
pure commercialism and not one of 
University loyalty.
The acme of absurdity is revealed 
when an institution of our calibre 
condescends to hoot and scream with 
a howling mob of schoolboys. As an 
advertising scheme the plan is excel­
lent—for the theater; but, as an uplift 
to old Uni., a miserable failure.
It is hoped our athletic authorities 
will grasp the incongruity of the situ­
ation and abandon the vocal “train­
ing” of the students when the curric­
ulum is announced next fall.
Very respectfully,
SENIOR.---------o---------

THE FEMALE OF THE SPECIES.
When the Himalayan peasant meets 
the he-bear in his pride,
He shouts to scare the monster, who 
will often turn aside;
But the she-bear thus accosted rends 
the peas.ant tooth and nail,
For the female of the species is more 
deadly than the male.
—Rudolph Kipling.
When the silk and linen salesman 
takes his sweetheart to a play 
And concludes the evening program at 
an inn or swell cafe,
He would chew a schweitzer sand­
wich, but the lady orders quail, 
For the female of the species eats 
more rich stuff than the male.
—Detroit Free Press.
When the drug and soda mixer takes 
dear wifey to a game 
And finds that she has passed up pots 
until it is a shame,
He must bear his scorn in silence, for 
his words have no avail 
When the female of the species starts 
to blame luck on the male.
—St. Louis Times. 
When the married man goes shopping 
he will buy a shoddy suit,
And, thus garbed, will wander home­
ward looking like a cheap ga* 
loot,
But his wife will spend a hundred at 
a millinery sale,
For the female of the species wears 
more glad rage than the male.

ITEMS OF INTEREST FROM 
NEW CATALOGUE.
Will Be Ready for Distribution Soon.
Among the new announcements in 
the catalogue of 1911-1912, which will 
be ready for distribution about the 
middle of January, the following will 
be of interest to the readers of the 
Tartan:
In the School of Applied Science 
a night course in Commercial Engin­
eering will be offered for 1912-1913. 
will involve attendance upon three 
nights a week for a period of two 
years, and the schedule of studies will 
be adapted from the Commercial sub­
jects in the curiculum of the day 
course in Commercial Engineering. 
The intent of the new course is to 
furnish training for the business side 
of engineering practice; therefore, 
only graduates of engineering schools 
will be eligible for membership.
The Committee on Entrance Re­
quirements in the School of Applied 
Science has taken action which will 
, admit graduates from the academic 
course in the Pittsburgh High School 
and the Allegheny High School to the 
Plebe class, beginning 1912, without 
entrance examinations. A High School 
certificate of graduation, carrying the 
recommendation of the principal, 
must be filed by the candidate for 
admission. It is stated that this vari­
ation from the otherwise universal 
practice in requiring entrance exami­
nations, was due to two considera­
tions: (1) the uniformly high en­
trance standing made by graduates 
from the local high schools; (2) the 
wish of the founder that co-operation 
should exist between the Carnegie 
Technical 'Schools and the local high 
schools.
In the School of Applied Industries 
a new course in telephony and signal 
work is to be offered by the Electrical 
Equipment and Construction Depart­
ment. The course will consist of lec­
tures, laboratory and shop wrork. The 
only special class to be organized for 
this course will be a night class in 
telephony, but a certain amount of the 
work will be added to the regular day 
course in Electrical Equipment and 
Construction.
In the School of Applied Design a 
summer course in painting is to be 
given in 1912, provided a sufficient 
number of students have registered 
for it before the first day of May. The 
tuition charge will be $20.00, and the 
work and instruction will be given at 
Camp Louise Carnegie.
In the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School the entrance requirements to 
the day courses have been revised, 
and the name of the Household Arts 
course has been changed to House­
hold Economics. Beginning in 1912- 
1913 graduates taking the course for 
Training of Teachers can specialize 
in Institutional Management, Secre­
tarial work, Textiles and Needle work, 
Drawing and Design, as well as in 
Household Economics. A plan is 
under consideration for the opening 
of a department for the training of 
Kindergarten Teachers, detailed an­
nouncement of which will be made 
later .
The date of the 1912 Commence­
ment has been set for June 14th, and 
beginning 1912 the Schools will open 
a week later in September and con­
tinue a week later the following 
June. In 1912 the first semester starts 
September 25th.

ONE-MAN BALL TEAMS FOR 
MOON.
Single Player Needed in Lunar League 
According to Dope of Chicago 
Professor.
According to Prof. F. R. Moulton, 
of the University of Chicago, one man 
is all that would be required to play 
a baseball game on Phobus—one oi 
the 2 moons of Mars, provided the man 
could live in a place without atmos­
phere. Prof. Moulton descrcibed the 
manner of play in addressing church 
society on “The earthlike plants.” 
“Our one man team would first take 
the position of pitcher,” he said, “and 
throw the ball horizontally. The ball 
would go all the way around the 
moon. He would then have time to 
get a bat and strike at it. If he missed 
it he could take his three strikes, then 
put on his mask, glove and chest pro­
tector and catch himself out when the 
ball came around the fourth time.
“In case he hit the ball and it 
bounded he could play the part of an 
infielder by picking the ball up as it 
came bounding around the moon. He 
could then throw to fi?st and catch 
himself out on the base as the ball 
came around again. If he hit a fly in 
place of a grounder he might drawT 
on his glove and playing the part of 
the center fielder catch himself out.
“A strong.batter might make a home 
run. This would mean that he struck 
the ball so hard that it went beyond 
the attraction of'this moon and struck 
on the planet Mars. It would be what 
we call over the fence.”

JUNIOR CLASS MEETING.
On December 14, 1911, at 1:30 P. 
M. a meeting of the Junior Class was 
called by President Richter. After 
reading the minutes of the previous 
meeting, a vote of the Junior Class 
was taken for the second assistant bas­
ketball manager. The results of this 
were McKee, 33; Richardson, 19.
It was moved and the motion passed 
that each member of the class- be as­
sessed $1.00 towards the Junior Prom, 
fund, this amount to be credited on 
the purchase of the ticket. This as­
sessment is to be paid before January
5, 1912. Mr. Parry, chairman of the 
Junior Prom. Committee, reported 
that the Prom, would be held at the 
Hotel Schenley, February 16, 1912.
W. and J. talks of withdrawing from 
the Intercollegiate Association of 
Western Pennsylvania because she j 
was not invited to the meeting of the 
association held in Pittsburgh on 
Tuesday evening, December 12th, 
at which meeting Dr. W. L. Savage 
was elected to be the court of final 
appeal as to whether or not a man 
was eligible for an association team.He * *
An article in “The Tech” of Massa­
chusetts Institute tells of Mr. Ringe, 
secretary of the International commit­
tee of the Y. M. C. A., speaking to the 
‘Miners of that institute upon sym­
pathetic and intelligent dealing with 
the working man. Mr. Ringe was 
here at Carnegie about six weeks ago. 
He spoke to the presidents of the 
several engineering societies and at 
one of the fraternities upon this same 
subject. As a result, several of our 
students are now teaching English 
to the laborers of the local steel mills. 
In the Union at H. I. T., Mr. Ringe 
said that he had been partially suc­
cessful at Carnegie Tech.

about the installation of the Honor 
system. M. I. T. is set without such 
a system; Stephens, the writer be­
lieves, is still without such a system;
so Carnegie seems to be among the
first of Technical Institutions to have 
adopted the Honor system.

THE CONSTITUTION OF THE 
ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION OF 
THE CARNEGIE TECHNICAL 
SCHOOLS.
The Constitution appears below as 
it now stands, revised and corrected 
to date. The Tartan was asked by 
the Board of Control some time ago 
to run this Constitution in order that 
each student might have the chance 
to read it over and become familiar 
with it. Lack of space then prevented, 
but now, at the first available oppor­
tunity, the Tartan takes great pleas­
ure in so doing.

ing. There they were sent to the 
boiler room and burned. The expert 
engineer in charge is fond of figures, 
and it was he who found that two 
tons of coal had been saved by burn­
ing the bends.
A Gentle Reminder.
BURN TWO BILLIONS IN 
BONDS TO SAVE COAL.
The government recently saved the 
price of two tons of soft coal by 
burning $2,000,000,000 worth of bonds. 
The saving was real because the bonds 
were old ones which had been re­
deemed. It became the duty of the 
committee of the Treasury having 
charge of the destruction of old cur­
rency to do away with this enormous 
amount of securities. They were sent 
to the basement where the great mac- 
erator cuts to pieces worn out money. 
They were dumped into the machine 
but the usual maceration did not fol­
low. The paper of which the bonds 
—old issues of war days—were made 
was too tough for the knives and 
there was no maceration. The com­
mittee is a resourceful one and in a 
short time the bonds were loaded on 
a big van, duly guarded and sent to
Nobody ever mentions it since they 
have come into money, but at one 
time there were scoffing spirits in the 
neighborhood who had been known 
to aver that at one time old Wellerby 
had driven a bus.
If that had been so, young Weller­
by had managed very succesfully to 
banish the memory of those dreadful 
days from his mind. There was a re­
ception at Wellerby House one day 
recently, and the young heir to the 
broad domains was observed to be 
ostentatiously showing off the family 
seal. It represented St. George and 
the Dragon.
“One of my ancestors, you know,” 
he observed pompously, “is said to 
have killed the Dragon.”
“Good gracious!” said a scoffer 
near by. “How did he manage it? I 
suppose he didn’t—er—run over it, 
did he?”—Answers.

(Continued from Page 1, Col. 1) probably improve as the season prog'
resses. Heisel played guard like a 
veteran and kept his man out of the 
game in a way that saved us from 
having a much larged score run up 
against us.
This man, J. Brown, comes from the 
University of Minnesota, with quite 
a record as a player, and showed that 
he deserves much that has been said 
about him. Lyford, the other center, 
is also some player as his score of 13 
points for the game shows Hansell 
and Bassett played as guards on last 
year’s team and were seen in action 
several times by our fans 
The Carnegie five showed good 
passing and team-work that is com­
mendable for so early in the season. 
Their offense was rather good and 
their defense much better than that. 
The weak points, such as shooting, are 
only those that will be improved with 
practice. Altogether, the indications 
point to a good fast team, however 
light.
After the game, the spectators were 
invited to the club’s parlors, where a 
short but very enjoyable dance was 
indulged in. The Westinghouse Club 
is to be congratulated on their spirit 
of hospitality.

CLASS OFFICIALS ELECTED.
THE FEDERATED ENGINEER­
ING SOCIETIES OF CARNE­
GIE TECHNICAL SCHOOLS.
The 1914 Night Class in Applied 
Science elected the following officers 
Friday night:
President—F. A. Myer.
Vice President—W. R. Dolan.
Secretary—V. P. Lewis.
Treasurer—C. B. Hugins.
Tartan Representative—D. G. 
Marsh.
Athletic Representative—J. E. Lose.
Thistle Representative—J. E. Lose.
Also a special committee was ap­
pointed to arrange a program for an 
evening’s entertainment during the 
Christmas vacation. The members 
are A. V. Dolan, P. E. Wakefield and 
V. P. Lewis.
With the belief that better results 
could be obtained for the students and 
for the men who speak in our engin­
eering societies, by the co-operation 
of the engineering societies, the presi­
dents of the several societies met 
and drew up the following article:
The following suggestions are made 
looking to the formation of a “Fed­
erated Engineering Society of the 
Carnegie Technical Schools,” a feder­
ation which will in no way do away 
with the individuality of the several 
separate clubs forming the Federa­
tion. The purpose being to bring to­
gether the students of the three upper 
classes and so counteract the separa­
tion which occurs in these three lat­
ter years, due to hte departmental 
character of the work.
At the meetings of the “Federated 
Societies” it is proposed to have a 
lecture, not technicalto any one par­
ticular department, but of a general 
character so as to be of interest to 
all. And because of the size of the 
audience which the Federation will 
command, it will be abel to secure 
speakers of wide reputation. This will 
in turn re-act upon the meetings and 
secure a still greater attendance.
A few suggestions as to the control 
of this Federation are as follows:
That an executive committee be 
formed, composed of the presidents 
of the Mechanical, Civil, Crucible, Ful­
crum and Mho Clubs.
That this executive committee shall 
manage the executive affairs of the 
Federation.
That a separate committee, consist­
ing of the vice presidents or whoso­
ever else may be decided upon, to ar­
range the refreshments and other en­
tertainment aside from the speaker.
That one or more of these Federa­
tion meetings be of an entirely social 
nature, whether it be a dance or some­
thing of a similar nature.
That the Federation meet every other 
month beginning with the month of 
November. That it meet on‘Wednes­
day evening. That the hour of meet­
ing be 8:45 P. M. to allow sufficient 
time for the business meetings of the 
individual clubs.
That the duty of chairman of the 
Federation meetings devolve in turn 
upon the presidents of the respective 
societies. ?
And finally it is understood that the 
separate societies shall hold their in­
dividual meetings during the interven-*I ing months.
On Wednesday evening, December 
the 13th, the several societies met in 
| separate sessions, prior to the joint 
meeting and four of the possible five 
voted to accept the above suggestions 
as a basis upon which to operate the 
“Federated Socities.” The Civil En­
gineering Society did not vote upon 
the matter, but will do so shortly. A 
favorable vote is expected.
At the joint meeting these decisions 
of the societies were announced to 
Mr. Patterson, president of the Mho
Club, who acted as chairman of the 
meeting; and so the Federated En­
gineering Societies of the Carnegie 
Technical Schools is a real, live or­
ganization, already doing business, as 
evinced by the success of the first 
meeting, when Mr. Humphreys, vice 
president and general manager of the 
Westinghouse Company, spoke upon 
“The Presence of a Man. Herman 
Shercut, in engineering ability and 
position, is sufficient to show what 
the character of the speaking will be 
at these meetings. The substance of 
Mr. Humphreys’ talk is given in an­
other article of this issue.

ITEMS OF GENERAL INTEREST.
Dean Connelly spoke on* December 
29th at the annual meeting of the 
Pennsylvania State Educational Asso­
ciation at Philadelphia. His subject 
was “What the Grammar School may 
do for the Vocational School in Penn­
sylvania.”* * *
Mr. Griswold, assistant professor of 
mining, spoke on “Lignite Mining in 
Colorado,” at the winter session of 
the Coal Mining Institute in the Sev­
enth Avenue Hotel on the evening of 
December 20th. He said that there 
are now six active mines in the Colo­
rado Springs district and 70 in the 
Denver Basin, but that since the coal 
contains 23 per cent moisture, it can 
not be shipped successfully.* * *
Prof. Morris, of Applied Industries, 
was another speaker. He delivered an 
address on “Industrial Training in 
Trade Schools,” at the monthly meet­
ing of the Western Pennsylvania 
Hardware Association, held in Fort 
Pitt Hotel on the evening of Decem­
ber 15th.
THE CLASS ”B” PROBLEMS IN 
ARCHITECTURE.
The Class B men have returned 
from vacation to begin work on the 
new problems for which' esquisses 
were made Saturday, December 16. 
The current order problem is a tea 
house on a terrace treated with the 
Corinthian order.
The plan problem is the designing 
of a monumental stairway. Three 
drawings are called for at an unusual­
ly large scale.

PLAYING THE GAME.
Having some curiosity as to how 
long the ball is actually in play in a 
football game, J. F. Tabler and W. 
M. Henry, two students in this insti­
tution, held a stop-watch on the pig­
skin during the Rensselaer-Carnegie 
game on November 25. The time was 
taken from the instant the ball was 
snapped—or kicked, in case of a kick- 
off—until the man carrying the ball 
was downed. With their observations 
for the first and second quarters, we 
give some information gathered by 
E. E. Duff, Jr., of our board, relating 
to these periods in the same game.

ers hurt not beingincluded by the
official timekeepers. The game ob­
served was comparatively fast, being 
the last home game for our team, and 
both teams having a reputation for 
speed.
A letter was received last week by 
the Director from Liebler and Co., 
managers in this country for the Irish 
players under the direction of Lady 
Gregory, inquiring into the prospects 
for the scheduling of a Pittsburgh en­
gagement. This company is inter­
nationally famous, and it is to be 
hoped that they make Pittsburgh a 
visit.

TEMPERATURE HAS MUCH TO 
DO WITH CORROSION.
In the course of an investigation 
of the corrosive action of salty solu­
tions and sea water on iron and steel, 
two British scientists have discov­
ered that the question of temperature 
is, in a measure, responsible for the 
contradictory results obtained by 
other investigators. From this invest­
igation it seems that there is a con­
nection between the water’s corrosive 
action and its temperature, and that 
3$ deg. F. is the point of reversion. 
Above this temperature all salty so­
lutions are less corrosive, and below 
it, more corrosive, than pure water.
Hydraulically Compressed Air 
Loses Oxygen.
It has been found,, according to the 
French magazine “Cosmos,” that air 
compressed hydraulically contains 
only 17.7 per cent, of oxygen as 
against 21 per cent, of the ordinary 
atmosphere.. This difference, which is 
nearly one-fifth, is said to be partly 
responsible for the ills to which cais­
son workers are subject.

A course designed to equip men for 
effective teaching service in the new 
and rapidly widening field of Indus­
trial Education is offered this year 
in the School of Applied Industries. 
It aims to provide a thorough mental 
training, adequate manual skill and a 
firm grasp of the fundamental princi­
ples underlying the operations of the 
several trades and, furthermore, to 
develop to the fullest extent the fac­
ulty of imparting instruction.
Demand for Industrial Teachers.
The great demand in recent years 
for industrial teachers is the. result of 
three main causes:
1. The rivalry among nations for 
commercial supremacy.
2. The imperfect provision for 
training skilled workmen.
3. The modern extension of the 
scope of education in public 
school systems to include vo­
cational as well as cultural 
training.
Owing to this ever increasing de­
mand and to the insufficient supply 
of men qualified to fill new posts 
which are constantly being created, 
the rate of wages paid to industrial 
teachers has risen rapidly, until at the 
present day the average pay of effi­
cient teachers in industrial schools is 
higher than that of those who enter 
the regular academic branches.
As a preparation for industrial 
teaching, the inadequacy of the purely 
academic training on the one hand, 
and of mere rule of thumb on the 
other, has been clearly demonstrated. 
Manifestly a course in which the prac­
tical, scientific and pedagogical stud­
ies are harmoniously combined is the | 
only effective training for this work.
The four main groups of subjects, 
closely interrelated, which form the 
important groundwork in the Teach­
ers’ Course are Shop Practice, furnish­
ing the requisite skill and dexterity 
and an acquaintance with the best 
method of shop management; Actual 
Teaching Practice under the direction 
of competent instructors, who help 
the student apply in his teaching the 
principles of educational theory and 
the most efficient methods of secur­
ing interest and individual attention; 
a thorough coi^rse of Technical Stud­
ies utilizing the applications of mathe­
matics, drawing, physics, chemistry 
and economics; and a careful study 
of the principles of Educational
Psychology and Pedagogy, upon 
which the science of teaching is based.
The preliminary equipment of the 
young teacher is, moreover, incom­
plete without supplementary studies 
treating of present day ideals in edu­
cation, the moral and social obliga­
tion of the teacher, and the place of 
the school in the social life of the 
community. Readings and discussions 
in the fields of political and social 
science, civics, industrial geography 
and educational history, are accord­
ingly prescribed with a view to stimu­
lating the faculties and broadening the 
professional horizon.
The thorough course of Shop Work 
is designed to impart a reasonable 
facility and speed in the use of tools, 
to enable the student to apply intel­
ligently the scientific principle which 
lie beneath the diversities of actual 
practice, and to develop resourceful­
ness and careful judgment in attack­
ing shop and commercial problems.
WHAT A MISPLACED COMMA 
CAN DO.
Taking some figures from a French 
publication, but failing to change the 
comma appearing in it into a decimal 
point, according to American usage, 
caused a Chicago newspaper to state 
recently that the largest single plati­
num nugget weighs 7,837 kilograms 
(15,674 lb.). The newspaper also 
stated that this great nugget was be­
ing kept in a collection of minerals 
belonging to Prince Demidoff, one of 
the two owners of the platinum mines 
in the Ural mountains, despite the 
great scarcity and increasing value of 
the metal.
The error of the statement is em­
phasized when one considers that the 
whole world’s output of platinum in
1909, the latest period for which fig­
ures are available, was not more than
12,500 pounds; also by the fact that 
the value of such a nugget, which, if 
pure platinum, would occupy a space 
of nearly 15 cubic feet, at the present 
price is more than $12,500,000, an 
amount even a wealthy prince would 
| hardly allow to lie idle. The correct 
weight of the nugget is 7.837 kilo- 
! gramS, which is a little more than 15 *4 
pounds. In France 7,837 kilograms 
woud be printed with a thin space 
j between the two first figures.

8THE TARTAN
j “WHAT’S WHAT AND HOW.” j
The Tartan is pleased to announce 
a new weekly feature in the shape of 
a “What’s What and How” column. 
The idea back of this column is mere­
ly to turn the luminous searchlight of 
publicity into dusty corners in order 
that the cobwebs may not collect to 
too great an extent. Should the beams 
so injure the eyesight of any person 
fortunate enough to get into their path 
that he is inclined to take offense, let 
him remember the spirit in which this 
column is written is that of friendli­
ness pure and simple, and let him 
take what may chance his way in the 
same spirit.
THE EDITORS.
If you should happen to be passing 
through the main corridor of the In­
dustries Building between 12 and 1 
o’clock, your curiosity may be aroused 
by the eager procession filing into 
Room No. —.
You may imagine that some aca­
demic discussion of considerable grav­
ity and dignity is attracting this glad­
some parade; or you may suspect a 
dog-fight. Wrong in both guesses. 
There is no Cerberus at the door and 
no “highsign” is demanded. Step in, 
if you will—and be sure to close the 
door unless earless of consequences. 
You will observe something like this: 
Facing each other across various ta­
bles and desks, heads bowed in os­
tensible devotion (not verified by the 
character of occasional explosives 
remarks), foreheads corrugated like a 
summer hotel mattress, pairs of ma­
ture males are worrying little wooden 
disks around over the plaid arena or 
bend devoutly over small graven im­
ages, that excites orthodox maneuv­
ers with the grace of a G. A. R. re­
union.
A worthy employe of the Schools, 
who administers first aid to injured 
schools property; also advice and ad­
monition to members of the faculty 
when he thinks they need it, once in­
advertently chanced upon this scene, 
and hastily retired in horror and in­
dignation to report the existence of 
this “den of iniquity.”
Over this solemn service presides 
its good angel. A sort of incarnate 
Xmas carol; a flesh and blood peace- 
on-earth-good-will-to-men. From time 
to time this negative diety floods the 
precincts with a vast and hersute 
smile, after the manner of the sun’s 
rising over an alfalfa field.
Upon reflection, the term “angel” 
is retracted, as an angel with whisk­
ers is manifestly unthinkable, especi­
ally endowed with the conventional 
celestial “nighter.” Ye gods, let us 
hurry on to another topic.
Initiation brings the discovery that 
this convocation is composed of spec­
ialists. In science, mathematics, lan­
guage (except of an apochryphal 
type)? Oh, no! not at all. Baseball, 
football, highball, politics, finance, re­
ligion (not applied), back-to-the-farm, 
woman’s suffrage, personal frailties of 
each other; in all these and more. 
But, on your life, no shop! This
is no incubator of swelled heads. 
Characters are given an exceedingly 
close shave, and no cold cream is ap­
plied either. The battle line of de­
bate is far flung and it is no place 
for “chillun.” From a corner comes 
an offer to trade a block of Cobalt 
i stock for a second hand stogie in a 
fair state of preservation; from an­
other quarter, heated controversy 
among the pink pajama farmers over 
pig-pen architecture; whether should 
be installed therein a shower or a sitz 
'bath; over the best dandruff cure for 
bald roosters; the forcible abolition 
of polygamy in the harem; the irriga- 
! tion of onions with lavender water to 
christianize their proper fragrance; 
j eligibility rules for hired hands. An 
apologetic voice advocates the intro­
duction of the honor system among 
fishermen (subsides amid groans and 
| cat-calls).
And the pauses of the forensie 
storm, chants the still small voice of 
the “angel,” “Mac, what do you think 
of the Shenendoah Valley for farm 
land; orchards you know?” or “K, 
don’t you think New Hampshire cli­
mate is favorable for apple pie and 
garden sass?” or “R, did I give you 
one of these ‘Outlook’ bunco cards?”
And then the congregation breaks 
up with a benediction that has fallen 
from grace.
Yes, indeed, this little room is the 
shrine of free, untrameled and unpas­
teurized speech, where neither admin­
istrative overlord nor autocratic jani­
tor may molest or make afraid the 
humble members of the faculty. They 
do not even rise when the superin­
tendent of buildings and grounds en­
ters. If the sound waves which these 
long suffering walls have absorbed 
could be extracted and, of course, 
sternly expurgated, there would be 
little left to settle among the shriek­
ing questions of the day. Students 
who occasionally stay through this 
unguarded portal usually back dazed­
ly out with protruding eyeballs and 
take to the tall grass. Come in, take 
your medicine, and go forth chastened 
and refreshed.
SUMMER SCHOOL OF CIVIL 
ENGINEERING.
The Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology has for years conducted 
a summer course in Civil Engineering 
at different points in Massachusetts, 
New York, Pennsylvania, New Hamp­
shire and Maine.
Now, a permanent location for such 
a school has been secured near East 
Machias, Me., upon Gardener Lake. 
A steamer will run between camp and 
the depot of the Maine Central R. R.
The location chosen is an ideal one, 
being on a high and narrow ridg& 
projecting into the lake. The nights 
are invariably cool, even in summer, 
the air is sharp and bracing, and there 
are excellent opportunities for bath­
ing and healthful out-of-door recrea­
tion.

Butting In.
In a small South Carolina town that 
was “finished” before the war, two 
men were playing checkers in the back 
of a store. A traveling man who was 
making his first trip to the town was 
watching the game, and, not being 
acquainted with the business methods 
of the citizens, he called the attention 
of the owner of the store to some cus­
tomers who had just entered the 
front door.
“Sh! Sh!” answered the storekeeper, 
making another move on the checker­
board. “Keep perfectly quiet and 
they’ll go out.”—Everybody’s Maga­
zine.

“See here, Mr. Casey,” said Pat to 
the tax assessor, “shore and ye know 
the goat isn’t worth $8.”
“Oi’m sorry,” responded Casey, 
“but that is the law,” and, producing

sage:

Street should be taxed at the rate of 
$2 per foot.”—Boston Transcript.
