Later this month, Carnegie 
Mellon community members 
will start to feel the impact of 
work on the Jared L. Cohon 
University Center (CUC) ad-
dition beyond the sights and 
sounds of construction on 
Forbes Avenue.
First, the CUC pools and 
lockers rooms will close on 
March 23 as part of efforts 
to renovate the building’s ?t-
ness facilities.
The closures represent 
one of many community-
wide changes taking effect 
over the coming months as 
the CUC addition begins to 
take shape. The pool and 
locker room renovations em-
body phase four in current 
project development, accord-
ing to the Campus Design and 
Facilities Development web-
site, following the entry and 
exit modi?cations to the East 
End Campus Garage started 
in August and December.
According to Director of 
Athletics Josh Centor, con-
struction is expected to be 
completed in August. He an-
ticipates that the renovations 
will improve the experience 
for both competitive athletes 
and recreational community 
members.
Timeline and Projects
The pool will close March 
23 to coincide with quali?ed 
Carnegie Mellon swimmers 
going to the 2015 NCAA 
Swimming and Diving Cham-
pionships. In the meantime, a 
number of changes will take 
place within the facility. The 
orientation of the Equipment 
Desk will change, workers 
will add a family changing 
area, and the location of 
laundry services will also 
shift.
Other renovations will 
address the needs of stu-
dent athletes speci?cally. 
Enhancements will be made 
to the varsity locker rooms, 
and a spectator balcony will 
be built in the pool area. 
The HVAC system in the 
pool area will also be over-
hauled to meet air quality 
requirements.
According to Centor, the 
goal is to complete renova-
tions by Orientation Week 
at the end of August, with 
the entire project ideally 
spanning “a little shy of ?ve 
months.”
Rationale
The push for renovation 
comes from a combination 
of competitive benchmark-
ing and community needs, 
according to Centor. Com-
parable schools, such as the 
University of Chicago and 
Emory University, have spec-
tator seating in their pools, 
while Carnegie Mellon cur-
rently does not.

Two weeks ago, Carnegie 
Mellon’s School of Computer 
Science (SCS) mistakenly sent 
out around 800 acceptances 
to its prestigious master’s of 
science program. Out of those 
800 acceptances, only about 
90 of those were to the right-
ful recipients.
This week, Dean of SCS 
Andrew Moore spoke with 
The Tartan about what caused 
the mistake.
According to Moore, the 
mishap was the result of three 
separate problems that all had 
to occur in order to create this 
result.
The ?rst was a software er-
ror. The department recently 
made changes to the software 
they use to notify applicants, 
and before the software could 
go live, they ran a test. That 
test showed that there was a 
problem with the system. Ad-
ministrators sent a description 
of this problem to all of the 
school’s master’s programs, 
including a manual work-
around that was to be used 
when sending out admissions 
noti?cations.
The other six master’s pro-
grams were able to do it suc-
cessfully. The second failure 
was the Computer Science 
Department’s implementation 
of the workaround. The soft-
ware also had a built-in check 
before any emails are sent out 
that asks the users “Are you 
sure you want to send out 
[800] acceptances?”
The third failure came 
when a faculty member, 
whose name has not been re-
leased, selected “yes,” sending 
out all of the emails.
Approximately seven hours 
later, a second email was sent 
out to all of those who re-
ceived the false acceptance. It 
came with an apology and the 
contact information of Moore 
and department head Frank 
Pfenning.

mistakenly sent you an offer

New Chipotle now set to open in Sept.

Students said goodbye to 
the Panther Hollow Inn, a 
popular bar for the campus 
community located at 4611 
Forbes Avenue that closed its 
doors for the last time at the 
end of the last academic year.
Since that time, the build-
ing has been gutted. The view 
from the street shows the bar 
and booths gone and the tiles 
torn out. An old mural on one 
wall, revealed by the removal 
of drywall, shows handpaint-
ed banners from both Carne-
gie Mellon University and the 
University of Pittsburgh.
Despite a prior application 
approved by the Department 
of City Planning for renovat-
ing the property, which in-
dicated that work would be 
completed in time for an oc-
cupancy date of Jan. 15, the 
building has stood empty 
since that date, with no obvi-
ous signs of further renovation 
or construction.
A more recent application, 
if approved, will have the 
building demolished and an 
entirely new Chipotle restau-
rant built on the lot. The pro-
posed process, according to 
the ?led plans, will take from 
the ?rst of May to the ?rst of 
September to complete, and is 
projected to cost $500,000.
Chipotle Mexican Grill is 
a popular choice for students 
on campus, so much so that a 
nearby location at 3619 Forbes 
Avenue, just minutes away 
from the new site by either 
foot or bus, is looking forward 
to opening day.

Pittsburgh Mayor Bill 
Peduto planned to visit cam-
pus twice last week, but only 
made it once.
Peduto spoke at the 
monthly Pittsburgh Student 
Government Council (PSGC) 
on Tuesday, and while he 
intended to address the Un-
dergraduate Student Senate 
on Thursday, he ultimately 
canceled.
Addressing the Pittsburgh 
Student Government Council 
in the Rachel Mellon Walton 
Room in Posner Hall, Peduto 
focused on how students 
can engage with the further 
growth and development of 
the city.
“I can remember vividly 
in the 1980s stepping onto 
this campus.... Pittsburgh 
was drastically different,” the 
mayor recalled, saying that 
the city had been through 
“an economic collapse. Not a 
recession, a collapse.”
“We had to reinvent our-
selves,” he continued, men-
tioning past Carnegie Mellon 
President Richard Cyert, who 
“put out a different call” than 
those just wanting to reopen 
the city’s steel mills.
“He talked about what 
could be, rather than what 
was,” Peduto explained, re-
calling that Cyert’s ideas 
of reinventing Pittsburgh 
through technology and edu-
cation were not well received.
Peduto spoke of continu-
ing these goals into the fu-
ture to improve the city.
“We have the ability to be-
come a model of what a 21st 
century city should be,” he 
said.
According to the PSGC’s 
website, the organization 
was founded in 2009 after  
then-mayor Luke Ravenstahl 
proposed a tax on university 
tuition that would be paid by 
students in the city. After a 
series of gatherings and the 
creation of a petition signed 
by over 10,000 people, the 
tax was withdrawn by the 
end of the year.
PSGC Public Relations 
Chair Sarah Jugovic further 
described the PSGC in an 
email as “a distinctive coun-
cil comprised of student 
leaders representing Carlow 
University, Carnegie Mellon 
University, Chatham Univer-
sity, Community College of 
Allegheny County, Duquesne 
University, La Roche College, 
Point Park University, Robert 
Morris University, and Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.”
Peduto was at the found-
ing meeting of PSGC as a 
city councilman with seven 
university presidents. Peduto 
recalled that the tuition tax 
“went against everything we 
were promoting ourselves to 
be.”
“We would be the only 
city in the world that penal-
ized not sin, but productivity. 
There are sin taxes on ciga-
rettes and alcohol, but there 
is no city that taxes educa-
tion,” he said.
Peduto began his talk by 
asking PSGC members in 
the room to introduce them-
selves, after saying, “when 
you ask what my vision of 
Pittsburgh is, it’s to keep you 
guys here.”
The mayor spent most of 
his speech drawing together 
Pool closing for CUC construction
“We have 
the ability 
to become a 
model of what 
a 21st century 
city should be.”

Feb. 26, 2015
A Carnegie Mellon student 
reported that around 11:58 
p.m. he was approached by a

The woman asked for cash so 
that she could buy gas, tend 
to her ailing mother in the 
hospital, and get a babysitter 
for her child, who was in the 
back seat of the woman’s car. 
The student withdrew $60 
from the ATM on Fifth Avenue 
and the woman gave him a

Carnegie Mellon recently 
received $17 million in do-
nations from three differ-
ent sources to support the 
construction of the Tepper 
Quadrangle and the nascent 
Presidential Fellowships and 
Scholarships Initiative.
Carnegie Mellon trustee 
James E. Rohr and his wife, 
Sharon, as well as Legendary 
Entertainment, founded and 
chaired by trustee Thomas 
Tull, made a donation to the 
upcoming Tepper Quadran-
gle construction project.
Alumnus Wallace Sadaus-
kas and the estate of his late 
partner, Patricia Chotiner 
Traylor, gave to the President 
Fellowships and Scholarships 
Initiative.
“The university is com-
mitted to attracting and sup-
porting outstanding students 
from around the world, and 
offering them an innovative 
education that takes advan-
tage of CMU’s path-breaking 
research and practice across 
disciplines,” President Subra 
Suresh said in a university 
press release. “These gifts 
help ful?ll this fundamental 
vision.”
The university announced 
these gifts at an event in 
California last Thursday, “In-
tegrated Intelligence: San 
Francisco and Beyond,” dur-
ing which President Subra 
Suresh, alumni, students, 
and faculty spoke about the 
future of machine learning.

Statistics Department among fastest growing
The American Statistical 
Association (ASA) recently 
featured Carnegie Mellon 
in its magazine in an article 
about how the university’s 
statistics department keeps 
students engaged in the 
growing ?eld of statistics.
Carnegie Mellon’s statis-
tics department is one of the 
fastest growing in the nation. 
Since 2010 the number of 
statistics majors at Carnegie 
Mellon has doubled; since 
2005 it has grown 20-fold.
“The Statistics Depart-
ment — and indeed Carnegie 
Mellon as a whole — exhib-
its an ethos that values and 
bene?ts from true interdis-
ciplinary work,” said Chris-
topher R. Genovese, head 
of the statistics department 
in the Dietrich College of 
Humanities and Social Sci-
ences, in a university press 
release. “Our undergraduate 
curriculum builds on this by 
offering authentic engage-
ment with interdisciplinary 
problems and extensive ex-
perience with the analysis of 
real data. (We have no ‘text-
book’ datasets after the in-
troductory courses.) I think 
this is a key to both the re-
cent growth and the continu-
ing demand for our courses.”
The ASA cites statistics 
as the most rapidly grow-
ing ?eld that falls under the 
umbrella of Science, Tech-
nology, Math, and Engineer-
ing (STEM), outpacing even 
computer-related ?elds.

On Thursday, Con-

funding for the Depart-
ment of Homeland Se-
curity (DHS), which se-
cures U.S. borders against

hours before the Depart-
ment would have been left 
unfunded.
Republicans in the 
House of Representatives 
have been rejecting drafts 
of these bills for weeks 
in response to President 
Obama’s immigration plan 
that he rolled out late last 
year, but decided to hold 
off for a week and not ef-

the shutdown were to 
occur, nearly 200,000

considers “essential” em-
ployees, including airport 
security personnel, would

Furthermore, employ-

FCC votes to verify net neutrality
On Thursday, the Fed-
eral Communications 
Commission (FCC) voted 
to approve strong net 
neutrality regulations, 
pleasing users and small-
er Internet companies 
and going against media 
giants and large internet 
service providers. The 
new regulations essen-
tially beef up the role of 
the FCC in regulating the 
Internet, which they feel 
should be considered a 
public utility, much like 
water or electricity.
Net neutrality is the 
principle that compa-
nies and service provid-
ers cannot strike deals 
and exchange money 
to speed up Internet for 
speci?c sites. With the 
new regulations, the FCC 
has promised that they 
will not incite tariffs, or 
other forms of mone-
tary regulation. These 
new rules mark a his-
toric distinction: Now 
the Internet is consid-
ered a public utility, and 
has a government agency 
regulating it.

---------------------------------------------------

a lack of spectator seating 
hampers community and fam-
ily participation in sporting 
events. “It’s very dif?cult to 
have parents there with the 
competitive swimmers,” Cen-
tor said. “We feel this is an im-
portant [addition].”
Athletes are also strapped 
for space in the current facil-
ity. “They have to share lock-
ers,” Centor said. “There’s no 
space.”
But the aim is to impact 
not only competitive athletes, 
but also community members. 
In addition to competitive 
events, the pool is also used 
for community swim lessons, 
recreational swim, club water 
polo, and intramural inner-
tube water polo.
According to Assistant 
Director of Athletics for In-
structional Programs and 
Recreation Sara Gauntner, 
on average, Carnegie Mel-
lon’s ?tness facilities see 900 
to 1,000 ID swipes on a given 
day. Frequently visited spaces 
include the pool, ?tness cen-
ters, GroupX classes, gym-
nasiums, and the tennis and 
racquetball courts.
The idea is to “hopefully 
maximize the experience of 
our patrons, which is ?rst and 
foremost,” Centor said.
Alternative Community 
Spaces
While the closure is in ef-
fect, community members 
accustomed to using the CUC 
?tness facilities can expect 
to change their routines. But 
the athletics department has 
worked to make alternative 
spaces available so patrons 
can maintain their desired 
level of ?tness.
“We understand there’s go-
ing to be a disruption in their 
pattern of behavior,” Centor 
said. “We’ve made accommo-
dations to ease that burden as 
best we can.”
Starting March 23, the 
CUC check-in desk will move 
up to the landing. Meanwhile, 
GroupX classes will still run, 
and Wiegand Gymnasium and 
Skibo Gymnasium will remain 
open.
Centor also notes that as 
the weather improves, the de-
mand for indoor exercise fa-
cilities may go down. “In April, 
it might not be such a big deal 
to ?nish your work over there 
and walk over [to Skibo Gym-
nasium] to shower,” Centor 
said. “In June, people can go 
outside and take a run or take 
a walk.”
However, these alterna-
tives still leave patrons with-
out access to a competitive-
sized pool.
The department has 
reached out to local partners 
for support. According to 
Gauntner, sponsors include 
Chatham University, the 
Jewish Community Center 
in Squirrel Hill, Club One, 
LA Fitness in Bakery Square, 
Chris Anthony Fitness, X Sha-
dyside, the Thelma Lovette 
YMCA, and Kingsley Associa-
tion, with pool access avail-
able at all but Chris Anthony 
Fitness and X Shadyside. 
Some of these facilities will 
be accessible for free, while 
others may charge an en-
trance fee.
After Memorial Day, out-
door pools will open for the 
summer, presenting an oppor-
tunity for local outdoor swim-
ming memberships at Carn-
egie Mellon partner facilities.
“We thought [the pool] 
was probably the most signi?-
cant part of our shutdown,” 
Centor said. “We’re grateful 
that our local partners are 
helping us.”
Vision
According to Centor, the ?t-
ness-oriented renovations are 
closely tied with the vision of 
the CUC addition as a whole: 
providing an enhanced com-
munity space to improve the 
outside-classroom experience.
“We are making a wonder-
ful investment in our ?tness 
facilities with the CUC addi-
tion,” Centor said. “We’ll cre-
ate a conducive environment 
for our students, staff, and 
faculty to come together and 
be well.”
Another result of the CUC 
expansion will be the addition 
of two more ?tness studios, 
and one studio dedicated to 
spinning. Currently, the CUC 
only hosts one studio — a 
situation that proves restric-
tive when scheduling ?tness 
classes, as only one class can 
take place at a time. The avail-
ability of multiple studios will 
allow the department to stag-
ger class schedules, offering 
more classes at more conve-
nient times for students, staff, 
and faculty.
Fitness is by no means the 
singular focus of the expan-
sion. In particular, a large 
proportion of the new facility 
space will be dedicated to stu-
dent performance. However, 
Centor said that every feature 
of the addition, ?tness-orient-
ed or not, is designed to serve 
the same community-wide 
goal.
“The studio theater goes 
hand in hand with the ?tness 
center,” Centor said. “It’s a 
student focused project — or 
rather, it will dramatically im-
pact student experience out-
side the classroom.”
A breakdown of project 
phasing, construction time-
lines, and other details on the 
CUC addition are available at 
the Campus Design and Facil-
ity Development website.
“We’ve been talking about 
things for a while, but now 
things are happening,” Centor 
said. “I just think it’s going to 
be so awesome.”

Swimming pool closing as construction ramps up
Kevin Zheng/Assistant Photo Editor
The Jared L. Cohon University Center is in the midst of an addition, pictured above, and extensive renovations; the building’s locker rooms and swim-
ming and diving pool will be closed beginning on March 23. 
Chipotle slated for Sept. opening
psychology at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, said of 
having another location so 
close. “Right now we’ve got 
students from CMU and Pitt 
and Carlow, as well as all 
the workers form the hospi-
tal, and I know it’s frustrat-
ing for customers to have 
to wait.… It’ll be good for 
the CMU students, but it 
will also take a lot of pres-
sure off of our store and our 
crew.”
Student reactions to the 
development are generally 
positive.
“I think it’ll be nice to 
have one closer to here 
since the one in Oakland is 
always so crowded,” said 
Jasio Santillan, a ?rst-year 
materials science and engi-
neering and biomedical en-
gineering double major.
Senior dramaturgy ma-
jor Rachel Abrams said, 
“Knowing how popular 
Chipotle is, they’re going to 
make a lot. It’s probably go-
ing to be a successful busi-
ness venture, but at the 
same time a lot of people 
miss PHI. A big contingent 
of students really loved it. As 
for me, I’m graduating, so I 
don’t really care as much.”
The construction is be-
ing run by Pittsburgh com-
pany Winthorpe Valentine, 
LP. The phone number for 
Winthorpe Valentine listed 
on the form appears to be 
incorrect, and the proj-
ect’s listed architects, Mor-
gan Architecture + Design, 
could not be reached for

the idea of retaining young 
students in the city and boost-
ing the city’s population and 
development, but also con-
necting those goals’ bene?ts 
to those Pittsburgh residents 
who are less fortunate.
“For ?fty years of my life 
I only saw one thing: People 
leave this city. My entire life I 
saw this city lose population. 
I was told the best I would 
ever be able to do is manage 
decline,” Peduto said. “We’re 
done with that model. We’re 
done with that expectation. 
We’re going to become a city 
that’s growing.”
The mayor spoke of the 
need to build a tax base to help 
fund development efforts, and 
hopes to do this through con-
tributions and partnerships 
with non-pro?t companies 
and businesses.
“Forty percent of our tax 
base is non-taxable,” he ex-
plained, saying that if Pitts-
burgh is to grow there is a 
need for revenue sharing and 
public-private partnerships.
“We look to our universi-
ties and hospitals as engines of 
economic development,” the 
mayor said, mentioning that 
the recent deal between Uber 
and Carnegie Mellon “could 
be huge” for the city.
Peduto spoke glowingly of 
School of Computer Science 
Dean Andrew Moore, who 
he said played a large role in 
Google deciding to set up an 
of?ce in Pittsburgh. Peduto 
recalled a meeting with Moore 
where he asked him what 
the city could do for him and 
Moore simply replied, “clean 
your air; clean your water.”
The mayor connected this 
comment to the environmen-
tal reforms pushed by past 
Pittsburgh mayor David Law-
rence, more than twenty years 
before any clean air and water 
regulations were being consid-
ered by Congress.
The environmental im-
provements that Peduto talk-
ed of served to connect all the 
goals related to economic de-
velopment back to improving 
the well-being of Pittsburgh 
residents. “There’s a bigger 
challenge,” he said, “thirty 
percent of this city lives in pov-
erty. Thirty percent of this city 
has no ladder of opportunity.”

Student Assembly Vice Presi-

Ph.D. student Will Franken-
stein about public transpor-
tation funding in the city, 
particularly the development 
of light rail, the mayor spoke 
plainly about the need for im-
provement.
“We need to invest in our 
public transportation,” he 
said, painting a picture of a 
connected city representing 
opportunities for its residents.
Peduto then outlined plans 
for community meetings and 
a website where people could 
contribute their ideas for im-
proving Pittsburgh’s transit 
system. He said that online 
“you can play almost a Sim 
City-like game of building 
your own system.... We have 
to be able to connect it all.”
Peduto did not shy away 
from talking about costs ei-
ther, adding that funding 
transportation improvements 
would have to be publicly dis-
cussed, and suggested the pos-
sibility of spreading out the 
tax burden between different 
sources such as sales taxes and 
sin taxes.
“I’m very cynical of poli-
tics,” Peduto remarked, not-
ing the irony of his statement. 
“I spent my 20s and early 30s 
running political campaigns 
and became so sick by it. I en-
joy the government side much 
more.”
Peduto said that he saw the 
economic future of Pittsburgh 
being tied to three things: im-
proving public transit, ?xing 
the city’s sewer over?ow prob-
lem, and the development 
of Pittsburgh International 
Airport.
“These are the three key 
areas we’re missing,” he said.
Peduto spoke of Pitts-
burgh’s unique set of oppor-
tunities for growth, and how 
the current size of the city 
allows for many projects and 
efforts to be feasible which 
may not be in larger cities. “I 
talk about Pittsburgh being an 
urban lab,” he said, describ-
ing in particular his vision of 
a system of child care which 
follows “a model of pre-K that 
goes all the way to prenatal,” 
and the development of after 
school programs and youth 
employment programs to ado-
lescents “out of trouble and 
give them opportunities.”
“I want to make the steel 
city into the education city,” 
Peduto said.
Julia Eddy, junior social 
and decision sciences major 
and Senate and PSGC member, 
was happy to have the mayor 
speaking on campus: “PSGC 
has been dif?cult to keep estab-
lished, so it’s nice to have him 
soliciting our opinion.”
She added that she was 
“really excited to have him at 
Senate.”
Thursday morning, how-
ever, Mayor Peduto canceled 
his appearance at the Senate 
meeting due to “unexpected 
events,” according to the of-
?cial Facebook post for the 
event. Instead, Kevin Acklin, 
the mayor’s chief of staff and 
chief development of?cer was 
initially scheduled to ?ll in, 
but then also canceled due to 
what the page called “unfore-
seeable circumstances and a 
miscommunication within the 
Mayor’s of?ce.”
Junior information systems 
major and Senate chair Evan 
Wineland said that he would 
be reaching out to the mayor’s 
of?ce to try and reschedule 
the visit. This visit would have 
been the mayor’s ?rst time 
speaking to Senate.
Wineland said that the 
mayor would have spoken 
about “connections between 
CMU and the greater Pitts-
burgh community,” and trying 
to “bridge a gap between the 
two.”

lon’s MS in CS program,” the 
correction email read. “This 
was an error on our part. 
While we certainly appreciate 
your interest in our program, 
we regret that we are unable to 
offer you admission this year.”
Moore explained that 
once they realized what had 
happened, “there was an all 
hands on deck effort to ... dis-
tinguish between the people 
who had been correctly sent 
admissions and the ones who 
had incorrectly been sent ad-
missions letters.”
They then took measures 
to ensure that every mistake 
made would be corrected, 
Moore said.
The ?rst priority was to ad-
dress the incorrect acceptanc-
es, but after that was done, 
con?rmation emails were is-
sued to all of the applicants 
who the department had truly 
accepted.
Moore said that their en-
tire admissions system is cur-
rently in lockdown to prevent 
mistakes like this one in the 
future.
Moore himself must per-
sonally approve all activity 
within the admissions system, 
and for the rest of the semes-
ter, all acceptances will be 
sent out one at a time.
Rejections, however, will 
still be sent out en masse. 
Moore also said that revert-
ing to hard copies of letters, 
sent through the mail, was 
not an option that they were 
considering.
Their goal is to create a 
sustainable system that works 
exactly as it should, Moore 
said.
The department is also in 
the process of writing a de-
tailed software postmortem, 
or an autopsy for the software 
the department used dur-
ing the admissions process. 
SCS hopes to draw conclu-
sions from what worked and 
what did not work so that fu-
ture projects can build upon 
strengths of their system and 
prevent the same mistakes 
from reoccurring. A short-
ened version of this report 
will be published in the com-
ing weeks.

CMU students create video game to aid in trauma therapy
JOSH BROWN
Junior Staffwriter
While most video games 
are made purely for enter-
tainment, a new game called 
“Transcendence,” created by 
a team of students from Carn-
egie Mellon’s Entertainment 
Technology Center (ETC), 
aims to provide not only an 
enjoyable experience but also 
a therapeutic one.
Transcendence began as 
a semester-long project for a 
team of students and advisers 
working in Carnegie Mellon’s 
ETC. The team created this 
game with both therapy and 
entertainment in mind. The 
game is based on principles 
of trauma-focused cognitive 
behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), 
a psychological treatment pro-
gram which attempts to teach 
patients strategies to encour-
age healthy thought patterns 
and reactive behaviors. TF-
CBT focuses on patients who 
have experienced trauma and 
attempts to facilitate recovery 
by helping them think and be-
have in more positive and less 
destructive ways.
Transcendence could po-
tentially be used as a supple-
ment for the cognitive portion 
of TF-CBT treatment along 
with clinical therapy lessons. 
“The therapeutic component 
of the TF-CBT process involves 
establishing a mental link be-
tween thoughts, feelings, and 
behaviors,” said Eric Chang, 
an ETC master’s student and 
head programmer for the 
project. Transcendence oper-
ates under the idea that by 
establishing this link through 
helping others, the player can 
come closer to sorting out 
his or her own interrelated 
thoughts, feelings and behav-
iors.The game accomplishes 
this by incorporating a plat-
form style, which involves 
moving an avatar between 
suspended platforms to ad-
vance in the game. “The plat-
form game portion is meant 
to keep the experience enter-
taining and engaging, [and 
links] the various therapeu-
tic portions together,” Chang 
explained. “The most logical 
way to implement a game 
for therapy is a text-based 
choose-your-own-adventure-
game, but young children 
often aren’t patient enough 
to read through block after 
block of text, and sometimes 
have vocabulary limitations as 
well.” The team settled on the 
platforming aspect because it 
kept the focus on the storyline 
but also engaged the player 
through active motion.
Transcendence’s story-
line is based on an animated 
African story from the child-
hood of Etaba Assigana, an 
ETC master’s student and the 
project’s creative director. 
The game’s characters are all 
animals, and the player as-
sumes the role of an advisory 
character who must mediate 
a certain set of social interac-
tions, discover the reason for 
con?ict, and ?gure out the 
cognitive reason for each char-
acter’s disquieted behavior. 
By making this link between 
behaviors and actions in oth-
ers, the player will hopefully 
be able to make those associa-
tions in his or her own life.
Keeping its audience in 
mind was one challenge the

Humans wired to see an image in different colors
Since last Thursday, an 
image of an ambiguously col-
ored dress has gone viral on 
the Internet, triggering heat-
ed debates on social media.
While some people see the 
color of the dress as black and 
blue — the actual color of the 
dress — others see it as gold 
and white.
Such controversy presents 
an interesting case involving 
the varying visual perceptions 
within the human population. 
Wired to see in daylight, the 
visual cortex within the hu-
man brain takes into account 
the chromatic bias of the day-
light axis when producing an 
image.
In spite of differing light-
ing conditions, the visual 
system allows humans to in-
terpret the ?xed color of an 
object.
 Hence, when people see 
white and gold colors, their 
brains remove the blue cast of 
the dress, with the perception 
that the image is in dim light. 
People who see the black and 
blue colors are under the im-
pression that the image was 
under bright light.

Physicists pose possible answer to origin of matter
Addressing a mysteri-
ous scienti?c phenomenon, 
researchers at the Univer-
sity of California, Los Angeles 
(UCLA) have attributed the 
asymmetry of matter and an-
timatter within the universe to 
the motion of the Higgs ?eld, 
associated with the Higgs bo-
son particle. The Higgs boson 
particle is thought to be re-
sponsible for all mass in the 
universe. Elementary particles 
acquire mass by coupling to 
the Higgs ?eld.
The researchers believe 
that after the Big Bang, par-
ticles and antiparticles existed 
in equal amounts, with the 
exception of a tiny asymmetry 
amounting to one particle for 
every billion. 
As the universe cooled, 
particles and antiparticles an-
nihilated each other in even 
amounts, leaving a tiny num-
ber of particles that gave rise 
to the stars, planets and gas in 
today’s universe. 
Thus, the ?ndings, which 
were published in Physical 
Review Letters, may explain 
the origin of matter in the uni-
verse.

Dozens of new sinkholes found throughout Siberia
Through satellite, more 
sinkholes have been discov-
ered in Siberia, and people 
speculate that there are many 
more to be found. 
While the cause for these 
sinkholes has not been con-
?rmed, researchers speculate 
that these craters may have 
been formed as a result of gas 
explosions. Last summer, sci-
entists studied craters thought 
to be formed by the explo-
sion of methane gas. Some 
researchers speculated that 
climate change will make sink-
holes more common. 
With the recent discover-
ies, there have been urgent de-
mands for research to con?rm 
the causes of these craters. 
However, the potential explo-
sions from gas emissions pose 
a risk to the well-being of the 
researchers studying those 
craters. 
Furthermore, gas emis-
sions have been shown to 
cause fatal damage on drill-
ing rigs, oil and gas ?elds, and 
offshore pipelines, which can 
ultimately disrupt the opera-
tion of oil and gas complexes 
in northern cities.

Scientists validate the presence of greenhouse gases
Last Wednesday, research-
ers published a study in Na-
ture that presented the ?rst 
observational evidence of the 
direct correlation between in-
creasing levels of atmospheric 
carbon dioxide and the rise in 
thermal radiation striking the 
Earth’s surface.
At two sites, one in Alaska 
and one in Oklahoma, climate 
scientists measured the quan-
tity of thermal radiation on 
cloudless days. 
Since carbon dioxide emits 
light within a unique range 
of wavelengths, the team was 
able to identify energy balance 
changes that came from the 
particular gas.
After taking measurements 
for more than a decade, the 
researchers discovered that 
an increase in carbon dioxide 
concentrations of 22 parts 
per million resulted in an in-
crease in incoming thermal 
radiation, measured in watts 
per square meter, of about ten 
percent.
 The team believes that 
their work supports the theory 
that human activity has played 
a part in global warming.

Prosthetic leg with an arti?cial vision system developed
At the Michigan Techno-
logical University, a group of 
engineers headed by Mo Ras-
tgaar, a professor of mechani-
cal engineering, is developing 
a prototype of a prosthetic leg 
that will be able to see where 
it is going.
The arti?cial vision system 
will be a low-cost camera that 
can identify the pro?le of the 
ground. Meanwhile, by ana-
lyzing the information from 
the camera, the computer-
controlled actuator will deter-
mine the location of the next 
footstep. 
Additionally, the computer 
will calculate the appropri-
ate angle and stiffness of the 
ankle, allowing for ?exibility 
in motion. A system of cables 
would control the motion of 
the ankle. 
The researchers have re-
?ned the actuator so that it can 
be carried in a pocket, rather 
than on the prosthesis, which 
will improve ease of use.
The team hopes that one 
day, the prosthetic leg will be 
introduced into the market to 
help patients in need of arti?-
cial limbs.

Volvo develops and integrates self-driving vehicles 
Recently, the Volvo Group, 
a Swedish multinational man-
ufacturing company, disclosed 
the latest developments in its 
Drive Me project. 
The project aims to allow 
self-driving cars to integrate 
into regular traf?c alongside 
cars with human drivers. A 
Drive Me vehicle gets accu-
rate information about its 
surroundings from a high-
performance GPS and a high-
de?nition 3-D map.
Working with many differ-
ent legislative and transporta-
tion of?cials, Volvo hopes to 
have 100 self-driving vehicles 
on the road in selected areas 
around Gothenburg, Sweden, 
by 2017. The company is work-
ing towards a near 100 percent 
reliability in their autonomous 
driving system. 
Developing compatible in-
frastructure is also critical for 
the integration of these self-
driving cars. Volvo is working 
on developing cars that will 
know what is going on a few 
miles away from them, not just 
in their immediate position.

but takes it a step further and 
allows people to understand 
the code that they searched 
for. This project, known as 
S6, searches code reposito-

?les for qualities such as their 
ability to compile successfully 
or pass basic checks and tests 
before running.

HOW THINGS WORK
LCD screens allow digital watches to retain usability 
JUSTIN MCGOWN
Contributing Editor
In The Hitchhiker’s Guide 
to the Galaxy, humans are de-
scribed as “so amazingly prim-
itive they still think digital 
watches are a good idea.” In 
these days of cellphones and 
“smart watches” that tell you 
about texts and let you make 
calls, the digital watch may 
look a little outmoded. How-
ever, while no longer as popu-
lar as they once were, digital 
watches are still a useful piece 
of everyday technology.
According to a PC Maga-
zine timeline on the history 
of the digital watch, the ?rst 
digital watch used gears and 
springs, just like an analog 
clock, but displayed numbers 
instead of moving hands to in-
dicate the time.
 The ?rst publicly available 
watch that used not only a 
digital display but also digital 
technology in the form of cir-
cuits was the Hamilton Watch 
Company’s 1972 Hamilton 
Pulsar. Plated in gold and us-
ing a synthetic ruby as part 
of its LED (Light Emitting Di-
ode) system, the Pulsar cost 
$2,100 (around $11,400 to-
day, adjusted for in?ation). 
That combination of technol-
ogy and luxury earned the 
watch a spot on the wrist of 
James Bond in 1973’s Live and 
Let Die.
While there have been 
several developments in the 
world of watch innards since 
the Pulsar came out, perhaps 
the most important change 
has been in the display. LEDs 
are today considered a very 
energy ef?cient light bulb, 
recommended by Forbes Mag-
azine over compact ?uores-
cents for the budget conscious 
However, the models used in 
early wrist watches used a lot 
of power. Further, the wearer 
would have to temporarily 
activate the display, a process 
that required the wearer to 
use both hands.
PC Magazine’s timeline 
indicates that the big shift in 
digital wristwatch technol-
ogy, from luxury status items 
costing thousands of dollars 
to everyday $20 timepieces 
at your local Walmart, came 
in 1973 with the introduction 
of the LCD (Liquid Crystal 
Display) screen. While early 
models were almost as power 
hungry as the LED displays, 
the 1973 Seiko 06LC intro-
duced the style of LCD still 
used in most digital watches 
today.
As their name suggests, 
liquid crystals have both a 
While no longer 
as popular 
as they once 
were, digital 
watches are still

Pugwash’s discussion topic 
this week was privacy and the 
Internet of things. Comput-
ing power is becoming more 
powerful, and is being used 
to record our everyday activi-
ties in ways that were never 
imagined even ten years ago. 
This explosion of data can pro-
vide a better experience for all 
of us, but at the same time, it 
puts the minutia of our lives 
on the Internet, where it could 
potentially be seen by anyone. 
Welcome to the Internet of 
things.
From watches to tooth-
brushes, thermostats to refrig-
erators, tech companies are 
encouraging us to record our 
activities and send the data up 
into the cloud, where they can 
look at it and optimize our ex-
periences. Due to how cheap 
and available technology is, it 
is easy to incorporate it into 
the most mundane aspects of 
our lives. Manufacturers can 
put Radio-Frequency Identi?-
cation (RFID) tags into prod-
ucts to track them, which work 
much like barcodes do. Then, 
they can use the data they col-
lect to ?nd ways to improve 
the product or use it more ef-
?ciently.
The information collected 
is not just about the devices. 
Data about speci?c users is also 
scooped up and used, most of-
ten in advertising. For example, 
there’s the story of Target mail-
ing a high school student ads 
for maternity clothes and baby 
supplies. Her father came in to 
complain, only to apologize a 
week later when it turned out 
that the student was pregnant 
after all. Target was able to ?g-
ure it out just through analyz-
ing the patterns of what she 
was buying.
The data is also used to 
improve user experience out-
side of advertising. Google 
recently bought the company 
Nest, which sells a smart home 
thermostat system. By sending 
usage data to the cloud, where 
it is then analyzed, the ther-
mostat can tell when you’re 
home and when you’re not, 
and learn to adjust the tem-
perature accordingly. While 
this is an undeniably cool ser-
vice, there are questions that 
arise: What if someone got 
their hands on the data, found 
out when you were not home, 
and decided that those times 
would be good opportunities 
to rob your house?
Once your personal in-
formation is on the Internet, 
it becomes harder to keep it 
from falling into the wrong 
hands. Even if it is only stored 
on company servers, and not 
intentionally shared or sold 
with anyone, there is always a 
chance that it could get stolen. 
As soon as you connect a de-
vice to the Internet, it becomes 
fair game to all the hackers in 
the world.
And even if that data is 
anonymized, it can still be 
traced back to you with a high 
level of certainty. For example 
smart watches, among other 
devices, collect health data 
that might be personally sen-
sitive. Removing your name 
from the data or trying to clear 
the metadata (things like the 
date or location the data was 
created, or what kind of de-
vice it was created on) isn’t a 
sure bet, because using statis-
tical inferences, it’s possible to 
narrow down the number of 
individuals to whom that data 
could belong. There are only 
so many people of the exact 
age, gender, weight, with the 
same conditions, who walk 
the same number of steps, 
who are from the same place, 
as you. The more data that’s 
collected, the easier it is to ?nd 
out who it belongs to.
One proposed solution 
was to have more regulation 
on what sort of data could be 
collected, or what inferences 
can be made from the data. 
However, this might hamper 
the ability of companies to use 
the information to create the 
optimal experience, which is 
the whole point. Making con-
sumers more aware of what 
data is being collected was an-
other suggestion. Most people 
don’t think about how if they 
buy unscented lotion and 
a large purse, Target might 
know they’re pregnant. Mak-
ing it more clear what infor-
mation is gathered and what 
it is being used for will allow 
consumers to make their own 
choice, if they want to contin-
ue to invest in the companies 
or not.
The Internet of things 
is coming, and it holds the 
promise of optimized environ-
ments, from toasters to ther-
mostats. However, the amount 
of data that is collected means 
that the limits of privacy are 
being put to the test.
often ineffective and dif?cult. 
Different styles in code often 
lead to this ineffectiveness, 
since variable names and 
function names will change 
based on each programmer. 
When a user does ?nd results 
for their search in this type 
of open source environment, 
the ?les would then need to 
be sorted and understood. In 
open source environments, 
it is common to ?nd complex 
?les that are dif?cult to un-
derstand and also incomplete 
?les that cannot be compiled.
S6 ?xes these issues by 
?nding ?les related to a user’s 
search and presenting the ?les 
in a graphical form. For exam-
ple, users can search for code 
by using keywords, test cases, 
contracts, signatures, and se-
curity constraints. The system 
will then browse through the 
repositories and return options 
to the user in an environment 
known as the “Rebus,” where 
users can browse through the 
different function calls of list-
ed repository codes.
 The program also allows 
users to edit the code and 
check to see if the code in the 
search results still work cor-
rectly, making the process of 
searching for a working ?le 
much easier.
As of right now, however, 
S6 has not extended to codes 
with external dependencies. 
This means that if a ?le de-
pends on an outside module 
or imported ?le, S6 will not be 
able to successfully compile 
and interact with the ?le. The 
complexities of ?les that are 
not leaf packages, meaning 
stand alone packages that do 
not require outside resources, 
make the installation and 
implementation of external 
packages a challenge.
 Reiss has been studying 
this idea of implementing 
external dependencies in S6. 
“Some things they’ll work 
for, and some things they 
won’t,” Reiss said. “If there’s 
a speci?c sequence of things 
that you must do to build an 
event and that thing is located 
somewhere in the system, you 
may never ?nd it in the reposi-
tory.” Reiss plans to look more 
into this area, but acknowl-
edges that the process will 
take time.
Reiss’ research and proj-
ects continue to span several 
sectors of computer science. 
He worked on projects such as 
S6 and a user interface-based 
development environment 
known as the Code Bubble 
that focus on connecting pro-
grammers to visualizations of 
code. Reiss has also worked 
on smaller projects, includ-
ing the sign outside of his of-
?ce door at Brown that tells 
people whether or not he’s 
there. This sign is a simple 
digital picture frame, but the 
frame is programmed to con-
nect to several data sets that 
inform Reiss’ location, such 
as motion sensors in the of?ce 
room and calendar updates 
from Google Calendar. Reiss’ 
projects and research branch 
in multiple directions today, 
but will continue to help pro-
vide users better interfaces to 
understand code.
HOW THINGS WORK
History of digital watches centers around LCD screens 
consistent shape and struc-
ture like crystals, but can 
?ow like liquids. An informa-
tive page from Case Western 
Reserve University explains 
how the most common type 
of LCD, the Twisted Nematic 
Display, works by suspend-
ing nematic liquid crystals 
between two plates of glass. 
Nematic means “string-like” 
in Greek and indicates the 
shape of the crystals, which 
form a long chain, according 
to Whatis.com.
When a voltage is applied 
to a nematic crystal, the mole-
cules that make up the crystal 
alter their orientation, thus 
changing their polarization 
and affecting how much light 
is able to pass through or be 
re?ected by the crystal. 
They work similarly to 
microscopic Venetian blinds: 
they have an “open” position 
that lets light through when 
there’s no current, and when 
electricity is applied to the 
crystals, they shift positions 
and polarity, effectively “clos-
ing” the blinds. The amount 
of energy it takes to alter the 
shape of these crystals in the 
case of a one color wristwatch 
screen is very low, which is 
why watch batteries can last 
so long.
The key to digital watch 
displays is that the liquid 
crystals primarily block or re-
?ect light instead of emitting 
it. Light bounces off of the 
“activated” areas and passes 
through the deactivated ar-
eas, but no light is actually 
cast by a typical LCD screen.
 As a result, many watches 
still have an LED light, but 
only use it to light up the 
watch face in the dark when a 
button is pushed. This draws 
more power than the LCD dis-

team faced. “We were design-
ing and building a game for 
kids who had been trauma-
tized by anything you could 
imagine. One of our initial 
ideas involved pirates on the 
high seas, but concerns for 
children with fears of deep 
water and violence prevented 
that idea from progressing 
any further,” Chang said.
Assigana expanded upon 
this idea by explaining the 
reasoning behind the incorpo-
ration of a third-person player 
perspective. The team “want-
ed to displace the player from 
a ?rst-person perspective in 
these interaction situations 
to avoid players’ projecting 
their own negative cognitions 
into the situations [the char-
acters] present,” Assigana 
said. Though a large portion 
of the game design was the 
experience and the develop-
ment of empathetic reason-
ing skills, the team wanted to 
avoid making the experience 
immersional to the point that 
players could be negatively af-
fected by it.
Potentially the most excit-
ing aspect of Transcendence is 
that it provides entertainment 
while also achieving goals 
beyond recreation. Assigana 
con?rmed this by discussing 
the ability of making games 
to facilitate social change. 
“Any type of virtual world — 
video games, movies, televi-
sion — offers a way to discuss 
and [test] new ideas without 
the potential repercussions 
of forcing their immediate 
implementation in the real 
world,” Assigana said. “Expe-
riences like these can cause 
players to re?ect on decisions 
our society makes, and how 
we view each other. I want to 
make games like these with 
gameplay styles that appeal to 
the masses, but which tell sto-
ries not often re?ected upon 
by the public consciousness.”
What Assigana speaks to is 
the ability of popular media 
to be both entertaining and 
thought-provoking. In fact, 
an aspect of gameplay which 
arguably makes for the richest 
player experience is depth of 
plot and complexity of char-
acters. Like Transcendence, 
some games allow their play-
ers to make associations to 
the real world and possibly 
even attain a deeper under-
standing of themselves. This 
is the point where any media 
becomes art in the classical 
sense; it holds up a mirror and 
gives us a new perspective, al-
lowing us to see parts of our-
selves or our world that we 
never would have otherwise 
been able to discover.
Transcendence video game functions as trauma therapy
The information collected is not 
just about the devices. Data about 
speci?c users is also scooped 
up and used, most often in 
advertising.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
As Pittsburgh weather approach-
es record low temperatures this 
month, public and private schools 
across the Steel City have been 
forced to delay the start of school, or 
else close entirely. Yet colleges are a 
different story, and that story needs 
to change.
Carnegie Mellon sits among a 
number of Pittsburgh colleges and 
universities that rarely shut their 
doors when the temperature gets 
too low. The university last cancelled 
classes in February 2010 for three 
days after the city recommended 
that campuses close due to massive 
amounts of snow. “It is never an easy 
decision to cancel classes, and it is 
rare that we do so,” said Michael 
Murphy, vice president for campus 
affairs at that time, in an interview 
with The Tartan.
But as the city once more com-
bats a slew of unforgiving condi-
tions, it is important that colleges in 
the area consider safety over other 
components of the decision-making 
process, such as the need to make 
up classes or individual costs to stu-
dents and the university.
A simple examination of college 
student travel habits at Carnegie 
Mellon alone presents reason for 
students to remain in their own resi-
dences during unforgivingly cold or 
slippery days. Many undergraduate 
and graduate students living off-
campus live too close to the univer-
sity to justify using buses, but walk 
considerably more than high school 
students.
Even students living on campus 
often live in relatively distant loca-
tions, such as Webster Hall Apart-
ments, Fairfax Apartments, and the 
Residence on Fifth. The icy walk-
ways and negative wind chills make 
for dangerous travel conditions as 
they walk to class. While professors 
can cancel classes themselves due 
to inclement weather, the likelihood 
that all of a student’s professors will 
cancel classes is low, pressuring the 
student to attend classes when they 
should not travel.
As Carnegie Mellon, as well as 
other nearby universities, endures 
the record chills, the university must 
rethink its approach to canceling 
classes. While closings may cost the 
school and alter syllabi, removing 
the pressure from students to attend 
classes would also remove the pres-
sure to travel in unsuitable condi-
tions.
Frighteningly frosty weather should cancel classes 
Molly overdoses show importance of drug education
As a result of a bad batch of 
MDMA, 10 students and two guests 
from Wesleyan University in Con-
necticut were hospitalized for over-
doses last weekend. The drug, usual-
ly called molly, is a form of ecstasy. It 
typically acts as a stimulant, though 
symptoms can be complicated when 
additives like ephedrine, caffeine, 
ketamine, or even “bath salts” are 
included.
The drug is popularly believed 
to be safer than other forms of ec-
stasy, though the National Institute 
on Drug Abuse reports that MDMA 
use can result in hyperthermia (over-
heating the body to the point of 
shutting down organs). This is espe-
cially a risk at hot, crowded clubs or 
parties.
While the Wesleyan case shows 
some of the health risks of illicit 
drugs, the lack of drug education on 
college campuses is even more con-
cerning. At Carnegie Mellon, drug 
education is limited to Orientation 
events and the required Alcohol EDU 
course online. Alcohol, not drugs, is 
the focus of both programs.
Though alcohol education is im-
portant, drug use is a reality about 
which students are often uninformed 
or misinformed. 
Of the four Wesleyan students 
who were arrested in association 
with the case, three are pursuing 
neuroscience majors, according to 
NBC. One is the leader of a campus 
group of Students for Sensible Drug 
Policy at Wesleyan.
While these students have re-
ceived criticism because they “should 
have known better,” The Tartan will 
not speculate about their choices. 
Instead, we believe that drug educa-
tion should be a higher priority on 
college campuses. The Carnegie Mel-
lon Health Services page titled “Alco-
hol & Other Drugs” only includes in-
formation about alcohol, marijuana, 
and prescription drugs.
Advocating against the use of 
drugs is an easy stance for any uni-
versity. The challenging, complex 
decision is to recognize the reality of 
drug abuse and promote real under-
standing about their effects.

This year’s Oscar went to much political controversy
Last Sunday’s Academy Awards, 
the whitest Oscars in almost 20 
years, struck a political chord. Note-
worthy moments included host Neil 
Patrick Harris’s opening quip wel-
coming “the best and whitest ... I 
mean brightest,” Fashion Police host 
Giuliana Rancic’s comment that Ze-
ndaya’s dreadlocks “smelled like 
patchouli oil” or “weed,” Patricia 
Arquette’s call for wage equality, and 
Common and John Legend’s speech 
after winning the Best Original Song 
Oscar for “Glory.” 
Harris’ joke demonstrated aware-
ness of a broader systematic problem 
— namely, the 94 percent white, 76 
percent male, and averaged age 63 
Academy — while also allowing the 
people who are the source of the 
problem to brush off any responsibil-
ity to change with a self-deprecating 
laugh. 
Meanwhile, on Instagram, Ze-
ndaya called out Rancic’s comments 
as “outrageously offensive,” add-
ing that her goal was “to showcase 
[dreadlocks] in a positive light, to re-
mind people of color that our hair is 
good enough.” Rancic’s damage-con-
trol apology was surprisingly grace-
ful, taking personal responsibility 
for having done wrong (as opposed 
to an “I’m sorry if you got hurt” cop-
out) and admitting to have “learned 
a lot” from the incident about not 
perpetuating damaging stereotypes. 
Though Rancic’s career may never 
recover (fellow Fashion Police host 
Kelly Osborne has already resigned 
in protest), Zendaya has demon-
strated her status as role model for 
women-of-color everywhere. 
Arquette’s call “to every woman 
who gave birth to every taxpayer and 
citizen of this nation” that “it is our 
time to have wage equality once and 
for all and equal rights for women 
in the United States of America,” 
earned enthusiastic cheers from the 
audience, but also represented the 
kind of watered-down feminism that 
is easy to support in theory but pro-
vides no useful path for change.
In contrast, Common and John 
Legend’s acceptance speech for Best 
Original Song winner “Glory” (in-
cidentally, this was the only award 
Selma took home) was perhaps the 
most powerful moment of the night. 
Legend’s statement that there are 
“more black men under correctional 
control today than were in slavery” 
was like a cold splash of water, and 
“’Selma’ is now because the struggle 
for justice is now,” seemed to bring 
the insulated awards ceremony 
starkly back to reality. 
Though this year’s Academy 
Awards featured more small steps 
than giant leaps, it brought up plenty 
of important conversations about 
race and gender that America needs 
to have and take real action to con-
front.
You’re doing enough: no need to overload
BRADEN KELNER
During a January strategic plan-
ning town hall, Dean of Student Af-
fairs Gina Casalegno asked a packed 
room, “How can we maintain our 
excellence in all domains while en-
suring a commitment to wellness for 
all campus members?”
Of course, this question has been 
discussed many times in many forms 
since I arrived on Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus, but until that town hall, I 
had never seriously considered any 
proposed solutions to this problem.
Why? Simply because many so-
lutions to the question of balancing 
wellness and work do not seem fea-
sible. Asking students to better man-
age their time or to take more free 
time for themselves places a large 
onus on students.
As hardworking individuals who 
were accepted by Carnegie Mellon 
because of our undeniable work eth-
ic, it seems almost unfeasible to ask 
students to go against their instinct 
and chance not performing well — 
whether it be on a project or test — 
in exchange for some downtime or 
consistently full nights of sleep.
Hence why town hall attendee 
Jim Lawrence’s suggestion that 
Carnegie Mellon nix the option to 
overload on courses has stuck with 
me for almost a month after the 
town hall.
During the meeting, Lawrence 
stated that at Harvard University, 
most students take four classes, or 
16 credits. There is no standard op-
tion for students to overload. In fact, 
when one student took six classes in 
2011, the Harvard Crimson found it 
so unusual that they wrote an entire 
story on his experience that semes-
ter. Quite a different culture from 
the culture on our campus, huh?
If students at Harvard ?nd their 
classes aren’t challenging enough 
during the semester, the Ivy League 
students are encouraged to do some-
thing else with their time. While 
students can still easily overwork 
themselves with extracurricular ac-
tivities, it is notable that they cannot 
overwork themselves with addition-
al classes. As Carnegie Mellon looks 
to de?ne its path over the next few 
years, administrators and the wider 
campus community should seriously 
consider Lawrence’s suggestion to 
do away with overloading.
While the suggestion will in no 
way cause all students to immediate-
ly more evenly distribute downtime 
and work time, the solution could 
work toward ?xing numerous prob-
lems. For one, students would be 
forced to ?nd new ways to ?ll their 
time that they had not previously 
explored. The lack of an option to 
?ll time with more units could lead 
to students doing something that is 
arguably more enjoyable than man-
datory coursework, unless they’re 
among those rare people who truly 
enjoy extra assignments throughout 
the week over a dance class, paint-
ing session, or time with friends. 
While many students already do 
these things even with a full course 
load, imagine how many more of 
these activities they could do, or 
how much sleep and exercise they 
could balance with coursework and 
extracurricular activities as well.
If students couldn’t overload, it 
could ?ght the notion that students 
need to constantly push them-
selves to work more and graduate 
as quickly as possible. If there is no 
suggestion online that a student 
merely agree upon the units they’re 
overloading on with their advis-
ers, students may be less tempted 
to do more work. When students 
are given the option to overload, it 
enforces the notion that we always 
need to do more. The decision to cut 
overloading could signal to students 
that their energy spent toward ex-
tra classes could be better spent on 
other facets of their wellness.
Of course, the idea to cut out 
overloading was contested at the 
town hall meeting and is sure to be 
contested by many campus mem-
bers at large if it ever receives seri-
ous consideration. Their arguments 
are valid: Students should have the 
option to take what they want.
But when our mindset is to 
achieve, do we seriously consider 
the bene?ts of extra free time that 
we could be using instead of attend-
ing an extra class? If we have always 
taken more classes than needed, 
have we ever tested the bene?ts of 
a few extra hours of mindless relax-
ation or self-endeavors into things 
like weekend road trips or full after-
noons off just to draw and read for 
pleasure during the semester?
Caroline Acker, head of the his-
tory department and also in at-
tendance at the town hall, noted 
that professors expend a signi?cant 
amount of energy investing in a 
student. When a student drops, the 
professor fails too. So why not make 
it harder for students to drop classes 
on a whim simply because they have 
added a built-in backup at the be-
ginning of the semester? The lack of 
an overload option could bene?t not 
only students, but professors as well.
And this is not to say that there 
would be no exceptions. Students 
needing extra courses to graduate 
on time or take certain courses in a 
particular semester to keep up with 
a sequence should not be punished 
with an additional semester. Howev-
er, for the majority of students who 
do not need these classes, their time 
could be spent elsewhere on lighter 
activities that cater to the mind and 
body.
It must also be pointed out that, 
by no means, do a majority of stu-
dents overload. Therefore, this op-
tion would not affect many students. 
However, it could greatly bene?t a 
subset of the campus that is hooked 
on units. And it could lessen in the 
rest of us the need to always feel as 
though we need to do more.

A PERSON’S OPINION
The Tartan is scrambling to ?nish our last few assignments before freedom. So we asked,
If you had a million dollars, what would you do for Spring Break?
Compiled by Justin McGown
BRANDON SCHMUCK 
According to the latest Washing-
ton Post-ABC News polls, President 
Obama currently has an approval 
rating of around 50 percent. This is 
extremely close to the 49.4 percent 
approval rating of George W. Bush, 
following a consistent pattern with 
the approval rating of previous lead-
ers. In comparison, CNN reports 
that Russian President Vladimir Pu-
tin has a high approval rating of 86 
percent. This wide gap raises many 
questions, particularly: How is the 
approval rating of a country’s lead-
ers determined by its nation?
Media networks paint a melan-
choly image of a low approval rat-
ing, but when examined closely, 
it may not be all that bad. In addi-
tion to Putin’s high rating, Political 
Research Quarterly reported that 
the average person in Beijing sup-
ported the government at around 
eight points on a 10-point scale. Are 
the governments of these nations 
that much better than the Ameri-
can government? It would be a lie 
to state that our government lacks 
problems. However, it can be safely 
stated that Americans have more 
freedom of speech and expression 
than citizens from nearly any other 
nation in the world. In countries like 
Russia and China, many citizens are 
afraid to speak their minds. Instead 
of true satisfaction, fear may steer 
their vote of approval.
However, an even more likely 
conclusion to the differing approv-
al rating between America, Russia 
and China is the deep integration 
of debate and political opposition in 
American society. America’s private 
news networks often criticize those 
currently in power, whereas the 
ones in Russia and China have more 
centralized media on which insult-
ing the leader would be unheard of.
In all honestly, a lower approval 
rating for Obama would not be a bad 
thing. No matter who is in power, 
the approval of American leader-
ship most often lingers around 50 
percent. This is because the nation 
has become divided by partisan 
lines and many people have quit 
thinking for themselves, instead al-
lowing powerful liberal and conser-
vative television networks to think 
for them. 
An approval rating tells as much 
about a nation as its leader. If a 
country has too low of an approval 
rating, such as Greece’s 14 percent 
approval rating, it becomes instant-
ly clear that the nation has fallen to 
economic turmoil or some other di-
sasters. In contrast, too high an ap-
proval rating signals obstructions in 
the way citizens think. It is impossi-
ble for a government to truly please 
everyone in the nation, and the only 
way to get a nearly perfect approval 
rating is through force or suppress-
ing free speech.
The approval rating of the United 
States or any other nation is not an 
accurate picture of how a leader is 
doing. More accurately, it is a mea-
surement of how a nation is doing. 
An approval rating cannot simply be 
“good” or “bad.” A truly free nation 
must aim to fall within a realistic 
range at which people are still free 
to think for themselves.

Low approval ratings are sign of free speech

Sports Editor
This week, the endless hunt for a 
Los Angeles football team took mas-
sive leaps towards a conclusion. The 
San Diego Chargers and the Oakland 
Raiders released joint plans for a 
new stadium in downtown Los An-
geles. E. Stan Kroenke, owner of the 
St. Louis Rams, got approval from 
city council to build a stadium on a 
plot of land he bought in Inglewood, 
California.
All three teams are moving for 
the same reason. They feel their 
current host cities are not providing 
enough monetary support for badly 
needed stadium upgrades. Now, all 
three host cities are scrambling to 
save their football franchises from 
Los Angeles, lest they hear about it 
in the ballot box. Other, more urgent 
bills are being shut down as cash-
strapped cities scrape together the 
pennies needed to appease the bil-
lionaire team owners.
While there is certainly public 
value to professional sports, it is in-
sane for them to be able to pull such 
power plays with cities. It’s not like 
any major leagues would crumble 
without public help. The money 
funneled from the government into 
stadiums is never returned; it sim-
ply goes into the pockets of people 
who were never struggling for pro?t 
in the ?rst place. Some people think 
this is fair because it is a democratic 
way of distributing sports franchises. 
If people vote against politicians who 
lose teams, the people clearly want-
ed their team more than they cared 
about the sacri?ced budget items. 
This argument is badly ?awed. The 
government has many obligations 
when it comes to ?nancial expendi-
tures on its citizens. Unemployment 
bene?ts and public utility subsidies 
fall under this category; their most 
ef?cient use for a capital-seeking 
business is not to offer them to every-
one affordably, but this is disastrous 
for a functioning society.
Professional sports do not fall un-
der this category. Games happen in 
discrete chunks, and television, the 
Internet, and radio prevent mean-
ingful restriction of access. No one 
suffers because they’re not wearing 
their Sam Bradford jersey. Even the 
Rams should probably stop letting 
the quarterback wear his before his 
knee ?nally just disintegrates. The 
government has higher order ?nan-
cial obligations that are necessary 
for the maintenance of healthy soci-
ety and that cannot be met by private 
interests.
In contrast, the NFL is a multi-
billion dollar industry that can build 
its own stadiums with plenty of room 
to spare. The government is funnel-
ing taxpayer dollars into the pockets 
of billionaires. It should never be ac-
ceptable for citizens to use votes to 
direct public money to something 
that is not a public good. In this case, 
those who badly need legitimate 
public goods are being overridden by 
those who see their need as trivial; 
this is the de?nition of the tyranny of 
the majority.
Regulation of this situation is dif-
?cult and probably impossible at the 
local level. As demonstrated by the 
current predicament in Los Angeles, 
cities would start legislating them-
selves out of professional leagues. A 
federal department of professional 
sports, meanwhile, would bene?t 
the public welfare enough to be well 
worth the trouble. The specialized 
government employees of a federal 
department would allow for the 
thorough investigation of kickbacks 
and other corruption without hijack-
ing Congress for long periods of in-
vestigation.
Even when relocation is not a 
hot-button issue, professional sports 
exist in a weird economic space that 
requires regulation. Having single 
leagues concentrates talent and cre-
ates both a better product for the 
consumer and more money for the 
producer. However, the leagues’ im-
munity to anti-trust law allows them 
to go about their business incompe-
tently with impunity.
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell 
would be forced to leave any Fortune 
500 company solely for his handling 
of the Ray Rice incident, let alone 
for his lack of response to issues 
with concussions in the NFL. How-
ever, he’s a convenient scapegoat 
for NFL owners and fans who have 
nowhere else to get their football, so 
Goodell keeps his job. A department 
of professional sports could carry 
out legislation designed to put some 
reasonable bounds on his and other 
commissioners’ actions.
By focusing on these efforts, a 
federal department of professional 
sports could be an effective govern-
ment solution to the pilfering of pub-
lic pockets without consistent input 
from sectors of the government that 
simply have more important issues to 
tackle.
Government should get into sports
Buzzfeed is not end of journalism, but its new beginning
ARIEL HOFFMAIER
The practice of journalism encour-
ages cynicism. Journalists internalize 
a philosophy of “question everything; 
trust no one; dig up the muck,” which 
suits their vocation well enough on a 
day-to-day basis, but promises storm 
clouds and hell?re for the future.
The common assumption is that 
journalism is dying. Revenue and 
circulation of print newspapers are 
at an all-time low and declining, es-
pecially since their core readership 
(the 55+ crowd) is literally dying off. 
Established “legacy” news sources 
are downsizing their of?ces and lay-
ing off staff, forced to compete for the 
public’s limited attention with the 
blogosphere — their arch-nemesis. 
Everything from discussion boards to 
Twitter feeds to especially Buzzfeed 
is a fatal threat signaling that people 
have forgone hard-hitting, unbiased, 
well-sourced journalism for its polar 
opposite: a discordant McFlurry of 
untrustworthy voices with click-bait 
?uff sprinkled on top.
The picture may not be so bleak as 
it originally appears. Maybe Buzzfeed 
is doing something right.
Buzzfeed calls itself a “social news 
and entertainment company” with 
“the most shareable” content that’s 
“rede?ning online advertising with 
its social, content-driven publishing 
technology.” Buzzwords aside (let’s 
pretend that pun was intentional), 
its business model is innovative and 
overwhelmingly successful. The site 
has had over 13 million unique visi-
tors in the last 24 hours alone, com-
pared to USA Today, the top United 
States newspaper in combined 
print and digital circulation, which 
has a 3.3 million daily circulation. 
Buzzfeed is also valued at $850 mil-
lion, with a projected 2014 revenue 
of $120 million.
Over two-thirds of revenue in the 
news industry comes from advertis-
ing, but one of the reasons Buzzfeed 
is so pro?table is because it has mas-
tered the art of native advertising, 
or creating ads disguised as original 
content. 
If innovation in advertising is es-
sentially ?nding new ways to trick 
consumers, native advertising is the 
Frankenstein’s monster of innova-
tion. It’s smart (while less than .1 per-
cent of site visitors are dumb enough 
to click on a banner ad, a much larger 
percentage will read an article en-
titled “Which Food Network All-Star 
Would Be Your Mentor?” sponsored 
by Buzzfeed’s “Publishing Partner,” 
The Food Network), and it may even 
be designed to be beautiful (like this 
hilarious cat litter ad), but it’s is also 
more than a little terrifying.
John Oliver gives a thorough run-
down of the risk native advertising 
runs in breaking down the wall be-
tween the business and editorial ends 
of the news industry that is integral 
to the journalism’s integrity. Howev-
er, as long as ads are clearly recogniz-
able as ads (via appropriate labeling 
and disclaimers), and as long as their 
quality stays comparable to organic 
content, it’s possible that native ads 
might be a win-win situation for both 
producers and consumers of news 
media. If no one is willing to pay for 
news in the digital era (and they’re 
really not), then native advertising 
seems to be the most entertaining in-
carnation of a necessary evil.
In addition to having such a solid 
source of revenue, Buzzfeed has also 
harnessed the Millennial generation 
more successfully than any other 
news media. 50 percent of the site’s 
visitors fall within the 18–34 demo-
graphic, and considering that 68 per-
cent of Millennials get news primari-
ly from social media, it’s unsurprising 
that 50 percent of Buzzfeed’s traf?c is 
mobile and 70 percent is from Twit-
ter, Facebook, YouTube, and so on.
 Buzzfeed also has a tech team of 
over 100 (one-?fth of its total staff), 
further emphasizing that the com-
pany has directed its priorities to-
ward the future. Holding the secret 
of in?nitely shareable content in the 
palm of its digital hand, Buzzfeed has 
made itself ubiquitous.
Of course, the biggest objection 
to Buzzfeed as a model for journal-
ism’s future is the fact that, well, it’s 
all meaningless clickbait junk, isn’t 
it? But that’s not exactly true. While 
the lists of “relatable” Taylor Swift 
and cat gifs may keep it popular and 
pro?table, Buzzfeed has increasingly 
focused its resources on serious jour-
nalism. It has made a habit of hiring 
away celebrated journalists from 
established papers, including cur-
rent Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith from 
Politico and Pulitzer Prize-winning 
ProPublica reporter Mark Schoofs. 
News articles take up a decent chunk 
of Buzzfeed’s homepage and the 
Buzzfeed News page is cleaner and 
better organized than that of The 
Huf?ngton Post.
Additionally, Buzzfeed has com-
mitted itself to diversity, with an 
impressive near-even gender divide 
across their staff and the stated goal 
of improving their racial demograph-
ic through “aggressive hiring.” By 
highlighting and amplifying minority 
voices, Buzzfeed is able to consistent-
ly produce content more interesting, 
original, and relevant to a younger 
demographic than that of many 
established news media sources 
(staffed primarily with middle-aged, 
heterosexual, white men).
Buzzfeed is innovative, highly 
pro?table, and — believe it or not — 
it may just be the future of journal-
ism. If everyone decided to be a little 
less pretentious, that may not be such 
a tragedy. Personally, I like to top off 
my in-depth news pieces with a few 
cat videos.

Penguins must get over midseason slump
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
This has been a bi-
zarre season for the Pitts-
burgh Penguins. Starting 
with the mumps outbreak 
in December that sidelined 
captain Sidney Crosby, for-
wards Beau Bennett and 
Steve Downie, defensemen 
Olli Maata and backup goalie 
Thomas Greiss, the Penguins 
have had an unusual sea-
son even for their standards. 
Crosby and assistant captain 
Evgeni Malkin have been rela-
tively healthy compared to 
their prolonged absences in 
the previous few seasons, top 
goalkeeper Marc-Andre Fleu-
ry is third in Goals Against 
Average, and for once the de-
fense is outpacing the offense 
with Pittsburgh placing ?fth 
in goals against average, ver-
sus ninth in goals for average.
All of this statistical suc-
cess and health should be the 
indicator of a monstrous sea-
son for the Penguins, but yet 
the results have been decid-
edly subpar. At one point fall-
ing out of the guaranteed top 
three divisional playoff spots, 
Pittsburgh has been scrapping 
along in a Metropolitan divi-
sion they were expected to 
put in their rear view mirror a 
long time ago. 
Thankfully, in a weak East-
ern Conference, the Penguins 
would need a catastrophic col-
lapse to miss the playoffs en-
tirely, although a little stum-
ble may be all that’s needed 
for the Washington Capitals 
to jump Pittsburgh in the 
standings and 
force the Pen-
guins into a wild card 
slot. There are many teams in 
the NHL who would love to 
be sitting pretty in the playoff 
picture 75 percent through the 
season, but playoffs aren’t good 
enough for Pittsburgh. Since 
the beginning of the current 
era of Crosby and Malkin, the 
motto has been Stanley Cup or 
bust. And while there was one 
true success under the plan, 
that was over a half decade 
ago. There is a new coach and 
general manager after the 
string of early playoff exits, 
but 
the 
mind-
set is 
the 
same. 
At the trade 
deadline 
that comes to 
a close on Mon-
day, the Penguins 
reprised in their 
role as aggressive 
buyers, this year pick-
ing up defensive forward 
Daniel Winnik from the To-
ronto Maple Leafs, winger 
David Perron from the Ed-
monton Oilers and center 
Max Lapierre from the St. 
Louis Blues. These acquisi-
tions were mainly focused on 
the major glaring ?aw that 
has faced Pittsburgh in play-
offs the past few years, a lack 
of toughness and grit.
Hockey is fundamentally 
different from the rest of pro-
fessional sports in its dramat-
ic shift in play between the 
regular season and the play-
offs. The Penguins have long 
thrived on the wide open play 
of the regular season, with 
the long quick passes, ?nesse 
and skill as they railroad their 
opponents, but come playoff 
time these passing lanes nar-
row and ?nesse and skills are 
replaced by strength and cross 
checking. 
In this new game para-
digm, Pittsburgh has strug-
gled, but its new moves, while 
done in the same aggressive 
fashion as previous years, 
have focused on reinforcing a 
different weakness.
Ultimately, for Penguins 
fans, the regular season may 
as well be the pre-season. 
Playoffs are the only thing 
that matters, and as such, 
much of these regular season 
stats and results must be tak-
en with a grain of salt. 
Recent Pittsburgh history 
has taught us that regular 
season success is not a par-
ticularly good indicator of 
post-season victory. Maybe 
these additions will help the 
push the Penguins back over 
the hump, or maybe this will 
be another in the long string 
of early playoff exits.
The more things look dif-
ferent for Pittsburgh, the more 
they are the same, but only 
time can tell if these changes 
are super?cial or meaningful. 
Either way, it’s time for Pitts-
burgh to get out of its winter 
hibernation and warm up for 
playoff hockey. Hopefully, it’ll 
be a nice long run into the 
warm summer months or fans 
will continue to be left out in 
the cold.
the show. They didn’t sur-
render any rotation players of 
note besides Cole, but those 
two ?rst rounders could be 
an issue as their roster ages. 
They won’t be able to turn to 
the draft to infuse new talent. 
But the Bosh-Dragic pick-
and-roll in the future makes 
for an exciting image.
The Pelicans  shed 
Salmons and added a legit 
rotation piece in Cole, a feisty 
defender and a decent point 
guard to back up guard Jrue 
Holiday.
Phoenix lost big in this 
trade as they lost one of their 
premier point guards for two 
picks and Granger. The for-
mer all-star is too washed 
up to contribute, unless their 
famed medical department 
manages to make a player out 
of him again. The ?rst round 
picks could be valuable if 
they hit, or as trade chips if 
they manage to become  real 
contenders over the next cou-
ple of seasons. They could 
and probably should have 
tried to replace Dragic with 
a player who could contrib-
ute right away if they want to 
make the playoffs.
Milwaukee Bucks acquire: 
guard Michael Carter-
Williams (MCW), guard Tyler 
Ennis, center Miles Plumlee
Philadelphia 76ers acquire: 
A top-?ve protected Lakers 
?rst round pick
Phoenix Suns acquire: guard 
Brandon Knight, guard 
Kendall Marshall, forward 
Marcus Thornton, a ?rst 
round pick from Cleveland 
via Boston
Boston Celtics acquire: 
guard Isaiah Thomas
The most unexpected 
trade to go down on deadline 
day threw many surprises, be-
ginning with the Bucks deal-
ing Knight. Knight was hav-
ing a career year, was nearly 
an all-star, and had led the 
surprising Bucks to 30 wins 
by the all-star break. Trading 
him at this juncture seemed 
to be an afterthought, but 
the reasons can be seen in the 
assets acquired and what it 
means for the Bucks future. 
Knight was the only hole in 
a stout Bucks defense, and 
MCW solves that problem. 
He was also prefers scoring 
to passing, which became an 
issue as the likes of forwards 
Giannis Antetokounmpo and 
Khris Middleton did not get 
enough shots. MCW and En-
nis are purer point guards 
and players who have the 
potential to excel defensively 
as well, with MCW’s length 
and Ennis’s quickness be-
ing important factors. Plus 
the coaching of Jason Kidd 
should help them develop 
as well and the Bucks don’t 
have to worry about overpay-
ing Knight in the summer any 
more. Plumlee adds some 
much needed big man depth 
since center Larry Sanders 
got waived.
Many were surprised 
that the Sixers were will-
ing to trade Carter-Williams 
in the ?rst place, since the 
reigning rookie of the year 
was supposed to be an inte-
gral part of their future. But 
with a another top-?ve pick 
coming this year, which can 
easily pick Emmanuel Mu-
diay or D’Angelo Russell and 
the juicy Lakers pick, which 
could be top six this year or 
top ?ve next year. MCW’s 
shooting issues and some-
times iffy decision-making 
probably played a part.
The Suns made a great 
decision by adding Knight 
to replace Dragic, and he is 
probably a better ?t, given 
his penchant to score and 
not necessarily pass while 
also being good as an outside 
shooter. 
However, giving up Thom-
as to get a washed up Marcus 
Thornton doesn’t make sense 
unless they manage to pick a 
valuable point guard in this 
year’s draft or sign someone 
with the cap space they will 
now free up. This will give 
forward/guard T.J. Warren 
more game time, though, and 
his development could also 
be important.
 The Celtics made a great 
move by getting something 
in return for Thorton’s salary 
and maybe a valuable bench 
point guard for the next few 
years. They did surrender a 
?rst rounder, but they have 
too many of those to worry 
about giving away one.
There were several other 
minor trades while the Wiz-
ards acquired Ramon Ses-
sions and Philly got another 
?rst rounder to take on Ja-
Vale McGee. The Rockets also 
got in on the action by acquir-
ing Pablo Prigioni from the 
Knicks and K.J. McDaniels 
from the Sixers. While there 
was no serious action by any 
of the top contenders (the 
Warriors, Hawks, Grizzlies, 
Cavs), this was still a day like-
ly to have a huge implication 
on the future of the league 
and maybe some outcomes of 
this season.

SPORTS BRIEFS
Men’s Basketball
In their season ?nale, the 
Carnegie Mellon men’s bas-
ketball team wanted to ?n-
ish on a high after already 
clinching their ?rst winning 
season since 2009 the previ-
ous weekend. Facing UAA ri-
val Case Western on Saturday, 
the Tartans put the cherry on 
top of their good season while 
setting up momentum for the 
future with an 82–71 victory 
over the Spartans.
The game started with a 
clear emphasis on defense 
as the opening minutes saw 
blocks by both teams and 
tough interior defense forc-
ing several missed jump shots 
by both teams. A jump shot by 
senior Jasen Blakney exactly 
half way through the period 
tied the game up at 16 as the 
teams continued to battle 
back and forth. A pair of bas-
kets by sophomore Chris Shkil 
followed by a successful shot 
and free throw by senior Seth 
Cordts gave the Tartans a lead 
they would never relinquish 
with just under 5 minutes to 
go in the ?rst half. Carnegie 
Mellon went into half up 7, 
35–28.
Out of the half, Case West-
ern cut the lead back down 
to one in the opening minute 
before Cordts hit a quick layup 
and three pointer to give the 
Tartans back some breathing 
room. Both teams picked up 
their pace and their shooting 
percentages as the previously 
defensive game transformed 
into a shootout. Thankfully, 
the Tartans got to do most of 
their shooting from the free 
throw line as Case Western 
tried to mount a comeback, 
and were able to push their 
lead to double digits with 
the ?nal set of free throws by 
Blakney to get the ?nal score 
of 82–71.
The win makes the Tartans 
14–11 for the season and 5–9 
in UAA play. 
Track & Field
This weekend, the Carn-
egie Mellon men’s and wom-
en’s track and ?eld teams 
competed in the UAA Indoor 
Championship hosted by Uni-
versity of Chicago. Although 
both teams placed ?fth in the 
?eld of seven, several individ-
uals of both genders had out-
standing days.
Senior Sasha Spalding had 
a busy weekend competing in 
several track and ?eld events. 
In the 60-meter she placed 
third during prelims but fell 
to ?fth during the ?nals heat. 
Spalding also competed in the 
200-meter dash, where she 
?nished fourth in the ?nals 
heat.
In the distance medley, 
the Carnegie Mellon A squad 
of senior Sara Kelly, ?rst year 
Sarah Cook, sophomore Ariel 
Tian, and senior Erin Kiekhae-
fer placed fourth.
On the ?eld side, sopho-
more Rebecca Fortner placed 
fourth for the Tartans in the 
high jump while Spalding 
placed second.
For the men, their distance 
domination continued with 
senior Thomas Vandenberg 
again winning the 800-meter 
run. Sophomore Owen Nor-
ley won the one-mile run and 
senior George Degen rounded 
out the success with second 
place in the 3000-meter run.
The Tartans also won the 
distance medley with junior 
Marc-Daniel Julien, sopho-
more Nathan Willis Vanden-
berg and Norley combining 
for a time of 10:06.75. The 
?eld events were tough for the 
Tartans with no top ?ve ?n-
ishes in any event for the men.
The next chance to com-
pete for both teams will be the 
NCAA Indoor Championships 
on March 13 and 14, where 
some individuals may be in-
vited based on their top times 
throughout the season.

With last minute saves, CMU club hockey wins league
NBA draft picks, exchanges make deadline day thrilling
NISHANT RENIWAL
Staffwriter
It has been over a week 
now since Thursday, Feb. 19, 
when 37 players and several 
draft picks were exchanged 
on one of NBA’s most exciting 
trade deadline days in recent 
memory. It took a while to 
comprehend the madness, but 
now that players have com-
pleted their moves and settled 
into their teams, we can begin 
to look at all the major trades 
and see how they panned out 
for all parties involved.
Portland Trailblazers acquire: 
forward/guard Arron Af?alo 
and forward/guard Alonzo 
Gee
Denver Nuggets acquire: 
forward Thomas Robinson, 
forward/guard Victor Claver, 
and guard Will Barton, a 
protected future ?rst round 
pick, a protected future 
second round pick
This was probably the only 
trade of the day that actually 
affected a major contender. 
Portland got their much 
needed wing help with Af-
?alo. On paper this seems like 
a great move for Portland, 
considering the limited assets 
they gave up. Claver and Will 
“The People’s Champ” Barton 
were end of the bench wings 
who rarely ever saw game 
time, upstaged by the likes of 
guard Allen Crabbe. With the 
emergence of center Meyers 
Leonard this season and the 
signing of center Chris Kaman 
this offseason, Robinson was 
always expendable. The ?rst 
round pick is probably going 
to land in the low 20s, provid-
ed the Blazers manage to keep 
their starting unit together 
this offseason. They probably 
should have made the same 
trade for Memphis Grizzlies 
forward Jeff Green instead 
though, given Af?alo’s lack 
of concern about defense and 
attitude issues he displayed 
recently in Denver.
On the ?ip side, this is a 
decent move for Denver, too. 
Af?alo was clearly being wast-
ed there and they had excess 
wing depth anyway. Trading a 
veteran for a potentially useful 
pick in the future was a smart 
idea. They, however, waived 
Robinson, whose energy and 
hustle they could have used to 
give something for their fans 
to cheer this season. Besides, 
this is not a trade that is going 
to have a large effect on the 
direction of their franchise, 
so it made sense for everyone 
involved.
Detroit Pistons acquire: 
guard Reggie Jackson
Oklahoma City Thunder 
acquire: guard DJ Augustin, 
forward/guard Kyle Singler, 
forward Steve Novak, 
forward/center Enes Kanter
Utah Jazz acquire: center 
Kendrick Perkins and forward 
Grant Jerrett, a ?rst round 
pick from OKC, a second 
round pick from DET, draft 
rights
The ?rst blockbuster trade 
of the evening was a quite a 
win-win-win situation. The 
Thunder managed to get the 
biggest haul from this trade, 
as they turned an unhappy 
backup point guard and a 
washed up center (plus a 
?rst rounder) into two skilled 
shooters, one of the best 
backup PG’s in the league and 
a talented offensive center. 
In one trade nearly all their 
problems got solved as they 
now have a player (Augustin) 
who wants to backup Russell 
Westbrook, shooters to back 
up Kevin Durant (Singler and 
Novak) and a center to play 
next to Serge Ibaka who can 
actually get buckets.
The Pistons ?lled a huge 
void since the injury to guard 
Brandon Jennings, and man-
aged to do it without surren-
dering any future assets. Stan 
Van Gundy is having a fantas-
tic season at the helm as he 
retools his roster. What this 
means for their PG rotation in 
the future, though, remains to 
be seen.
Utah managed to get a ?rst 
rounder for a player they con-
sidered expendable since the 
emergence of Rudy Gobert. 
However, their lack of offense 
from the front court could be 
an issue down the line.
Miami Heat acquire: guard 
Goran Dragic and evil twin 
Zoran Dragic
New Orleans Pelicans 
acquire: guard Norris Cole, 
forward Shawne Williams, 
Justin Hamilton
Phoenix Suns acquire: 
forward Danny Granger, 
forward/guard John Salmons, 
?rst round picks from Miami 
in 2017 and 2019
Miami de?nitely won this 
trade as they solved a prob-
lem in their rotation lingering 
from the James era by getting 
a quality point guard to run

The Carnegie Mellon club ice hockey team had a winning weekend, ?rst defeating the Pitt-Greensburg Bobcats 5–4 and then, in overtime, cruising to a 4–2 victory over the California University of Pennsylvania Vulcans. The 
victories were largely due to an aggressive offense and a goal that was sealed tight. 
Kumar’s dedication, intensity lead both on and off court
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
Junior tennis player Yu-
vraj Kumar has come a long 
way from his beginnings as a 
player, both ?guratively and 
literally. The decision science 
and policy management ma-
jor from New Delhi, India is 
a force to be reckoned with 
both on and off the courts.
Kumar ?rst became inter-
ested in tennis when he was 
around ?ve years old. “My dad 
used to play competitively, so 
his drive sort of passed down 
onto me,” Kumar said. While 
he played a variety of sports 
— including cricket, basket-
ball, and soccer — tennis was 
the sport he went into with 
a competitive mindset. His 
prowess with the sport only 
grew with time, taking him to 
competitions around and out-
side of the country. His proud-
est moment during this time 
came when he participated in 
the Junior Asia Cup as a mem-
ber of the Indian men’s team.
When the time came to 
choose a school, he said he 
wanted a place where he was 
more than just an athlete: “Ac-
ademics were in the backseat 
when I was younger, but they 
became very important to me 
by the time I got older.”
Kumar knew he wanted to 
go to school in the U.S., but 
he didn’t know exactly where. 
Kumar looked at various Divi-
sion I schools but quickly de-
cided that they would be too 
one-sided. As he expanded 
his search, he found in Carn-
egie Mellon a place where he 
believed he could get a multi-
dimensional experience. He 
welcomed the opportunity 
for rigorous academic chal-
lenges, a motivated team at-
mosphere, and a wealth of 
extracurricular activities.
Kumar started playing 
with the tennis team a week 
after stepping on campus for 
the ?rst time as a freshman. 
He remembered how thrilling 
winning his ?rst big match 
against Amherst College was. 
“From the start, we were a 
tight-knit team,” Kumar said.
From then on, he found 
himself improving in both 
singles and in doubles. His 
current singles record of 20-
13 is only getting better, and 
his doubles record stands at 
23-16. His chemistry with his 
teammates has grown consid-
erably. “The team has gotten 
a lot more dedicated, driven, 
and passionate,” Kumar said, 
citing the strong team-orient-
ed focus all the members have. 
He has done particularly well 
with senior mechanical and 
biomedical engineering ma-
jor Bryce Beisswanger; they 
earned spots on the All-UAA 
Second Team for the 2012-
2013 year and were ranked 
eighth regionally in doubles 
for the 2013-2014 year.
Off the courts, Kumar has 
dedicated time for both the 
full Carnegie Mellon academ-
ic workload and various other 
commitments. He is a proud 
member of Sigma Phi Epsilon, 
and he’s spent a good amount 
of time involved in the Lunar 
Gala. “I just wanted to em-
brace the full college experi-
ence,” he said. He believes 
that coming to Carnegie 
Mellon has been one of the 
best decisions he has made, 
considering it to be a great 
privilege to be at a renowned 
university with so many dedi-
cated people.
Even though he still has a 
good amount of time left at 
Carnegie Mellon, Kumar has 
already set his eyes towards 
the future. He wants to work 
in the ?nance industry to gain 
corporate experience. After-
wards, he wants to be able to 
start and run his own com-
pany, a dream that is coming 
closer to becoming a reality 
with each passing day. How-
ever, he certainly won’t let his 
professional dreams keep him 
away from his favorite sport. 
“Tennis will be a part of my 
life no matter where I go.”

This weekend, the Carn-
egie Mellon club ice hockey 
team competed in the Col-
lege Hockey East open league 
championships.
In Friday’s semi?nal, the 
Tartans took on the University 
of Pittsburgh at Greensburg 
after coming into the post sea-
son as the last seed. After giv-
ing up an early goal, Carnegie 
Mellon made sure to keep the 
damage in check with a quick 
response less than a minute 
later by graduate student Gar-
ret Stack, with assists by soph-
omores John Bird and Connor 
Siwik. The rest of the ?rst pe-
riod was generally muted with 
only one late penalty for the 
Bobcats and no other scoring 
after the initial outburst.
The second period was a 
different story, with a series 
of penalties creating multiple 
power play opportunities for 
each side. Pitt-Greensburg 
capitalized ?rst with a power 
play goal at the 12 minute 
mark, but the Tartans again 
responded quickly with an 
even strength goal by senior 
Justin Fischler. 
Siwik then gave Carnegie 
Mellon their ?rst lead of the 
game a few minutes later, be-
fore a busted opportunity and 
short-handed goal by the Bob-
cats tied the game up at three 
going into the ?nal period.
The third period had all the 
physicality of the second with 
the low scoring of the ?rst. Al-
though each team had some 
opportunities early on, the 
game changed with a slashing 
call on Fischler. 
This power play gave Pitt-
Greensburg the opportunity 
to take the lead with less than 
four minutes to go. 
The Tartans fought off the 
play for over a minute and 
half, until the Bobcats got 
their opportunity and scored 
a hat trick for Pitt-Greensburg 
forward Nick Vecchio. As they 
had done all game, Carnegie 
Mellon responded swiftly and 
determinedly, with Stack scor-
ing the tying goal off of an as-
sist by junior Chad Trice with 
less than a minute left.
Overtime was heated, but 
the referees let the two teams 
play until Trice got a break-
away just past the 10-minute 
mark. 
Out of options and fearing 
the breakaway, the Bobcats 
pulled him down from behind, 
resulting in a penalty shot for 
Trice, who converted to send 
the Tartans into the ?nals 5–4. 
Aside from the clutch heroics 
by the Tartans, the most im-
pressive performance was by 
back-up goal keeper sopho-
more Nate Grathwohl, who 
saved 89 percent of the shots 
that came his way.
In the ?nals, Carnegie Mel-
lon faced off against California 
University of Pennsylvania’s 
club team. As with the previ-
ous night, the Tartans fell be-
hind late in the ?rst period, 
but quickly rallied with a goal 
by Fischler, assisted by sopho-
more Neil Carleton. 
Carleton found Fischler 
again for a goal in the ?nal 
seconds of the period on a 
power play, with the Carleton 
connection of ?rst-year Kellen 
Carleton to brother Neil start-
ing the play.
A short-handed goal to 
start the second with Fichler 
?nding Trice, who found the 
back of the net, and an unas-
sisted goal by Siwik half way 
through the third put the 
game out of reach. The game 
got chippy in the third period 
as the referees desperately 
tried to take control late in the 
game with a string of penal-
ties at the 4:05 mark on both 
teams, but ended up in two 
10-minute misconducts on the 
Vulcans. 
With a single second left, 
California scored a power 
play goal, but it was too little 
and too late as the Tartans 
cruised to the championship 
title 4–2. After missing the 
previous game, sophomore 
Jon Booream returned to the 
net and had a stellar perfor-
mance with 29 saves and a 
93.5 percent save rate.

Sweet snack suggestion
Dress up some Chex for a creative and delicious diversion
This week’s sweets are brought to you by the letter 
N for nostalgia (also maybe nachos and newspaper).
When I’m in The Tartan office each week, I 
inevitably run down to Entropy to grab some 
chips or popcorn to munch on while I work. It’s 
all just part of my process, because I’m a genius 
and geniuses just have those. But I’m getting 
pretty tired of potato chips, Doritos, and Smartfood 
popcorn while I swig from my gallon-sized jug of 
Arizona iced tea. It’s delicious, but I need a change 
of pace. Maybe something sweet. Something I can 
still mindlessly munch on. And ideally, something 
easy. You know what’s all of those things? Puppy 
chow.
If you’ve never heard of puppy chow, you are in for 
a treat. Depending on where you come from, you 
may know it as muddy buddies, sweet minglers, 
or white trash. It doesn’t matter what you call it, 
it’s still perfect. Classic puppy chow is Chex cereal 
coated in a delightful chocolate peanut butter 
mixture, then tossed in powdered sugar. So simple, 
so addicting, and not for the weak-willed.
While the original is delicious, there are actually 
hundreds of variations. Cookies and cream, red 
velvet, lemon, peppermint, thin mint, hot chocolate, 
cookie dough, and the list just keeps going. Since 
I am so benevolent, I wanted to make enough for 
the whole office to enjoy. And I figured, why not 
make two kinds? Twice the fun! I made both the 
classic — because it’s kind of a sin to mess with 
something that’s already so perfect — and also 
a cake batter variation. Cake batter is one of my 
favorite dessert flavors ever, only second maybe to 
cotton candy.
Quick equipment suggestion: I actually don’t have 
any mixing bowls in my apartment. I do all my 
baking in a large pot, which is pretty strange. So 
when I was at Giant Eagle to shop for ingredients, 
I found a set of two big plastic Tupperware mixing 
bowls for only $6.50. They even have lids which 
were perfect for shaking in the powdered sugar 
at the end. Using these inexpensive tupperware 
or something similar will greatly improve the ease 
with which you can create this delicious treat.
Original Puppy Chow
5 cups of Chex cereal
1/2 cup of chocolate chips (I prefer milk chocolate, 
but if semisweet is your thing, you have my 
blessing)
1/3 cup of peanut butter
2 tablespoons of butter
3/4 cup of powdered sugar
This is a recipe where the work is so little and 
the reward is so tremendous that you might start 
dancing with joy. Start by measuring out the cereal 
into a pretty big bowl or even a gallon sized zip 
lock bag, if you’re short on bowls. Next heat the 
chocolate chips, peanut butter and butter in a small 
pot over pretty low heat, stirring frequently because 
burned chocolate is a tragedy. When this melts 
into a smooth shiny sauce, pour it into the bowl of 
cereal. Then stir it up, but be really super gentle 
so you don’t crush the cereal. Finally dump in the 
powdered sugar and shake it all up. Let it sit for a 
little while so the chocolate coating can come back 
to room temperature. After five or so minutes, dig 
in!
Cake Batter Puppy Chow
5 cups of Chex cereal
1/4 cup of butter
3 tablespoons of heavy cream
10 ounces of white chocolate
1 teaspoon of almond extract
2/3 cup of rainbow sprinkles
1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar
This is going to be almost identical to the first 
recipe, but with a few tweaks here and there. Still 
start out by putting the cereal into a big bowl. Next 
melt the white chocolate, heavy cream, and butter 
over low heat, stirring all the while. This mixture 
will be much less beautiful than the chocolate 
peanut butter one, because white chocolate just 
has a different texture. It will be a little thick and 
goopy, but delicious nonetheless! Once it’s all 
melted together, stir in the almond extract and pour 
the mixture over the cereal. After that’s all mixed 
up, add the sprinkles and give it another stir. Add 
the powdered sugar, shake it around, and you’re 
done. Let it set for a few minutes, then proceed to 
stuff your face. I will be incredibly impressed if you 
have any left the next day.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
I wrote to you last 
semester about my 
regrettable swipe to the 
right on Tinder, and how 
I got locked into a date 
with a guy I never wanted 
to see. Your advice saved 
my butt, and being that 
vulgar and uninhibited on 
a dinner date was some 
of the most fun I’ve ever 
had.
I deleted Tinder, and I’m 
in a steady relationship 
with my job — sitting 
on cars in short skirts 
and bikinis for Ford 
advertisements. But 
Tinder doesn’t seem to be 
done with me. Yesterday, 
my friend in Edinburgh, 
Scotland messaged 
me on Facebook, and 
apparently, someone 
there has been using my 
portfolio shots from my 
work to catfish men. 
I did use work photos on 
Tinder the week before 
I deleted the app, but I 
never thought someone 
would end up using them! 
If my bosses find out, 
I’ll have to go back to 
nude modeling for adult 
amateur art classes. 
How can I discreetly get 
this Scottish bastard to 
delete his fake profile?
Thanks,
Typical Idiot Not Doing 
Everything Right with 
my Body, Always Incises 
my Top Out Of Photos 
(Seriously)
Dear TINDER BAIT, OOPS,
 
I’m glad my advice from last 
time worked out so well! But 
you’re working as a sexy 
car ornament now? That’s 
a pretty lucrative way to 
show off your body, probably 
much more so than Tuesday 
art nights at the elder hostel. 
So, I guess … follow your 
dreams?
I think you’re overreacting 
a little here. I don’t know 
how many catfish scams are 
unveiled per day, but with 
the climbing popularity of 
dating and hookup apps, it’s 
got to be up there. At least 
the likelihood of you knowing 
this identity-stealing Scottish 
clown is pretty low, unless 
this was your friend’s odd, 
covert way of turning him or 
herself in. 
So, you could alert the app’s 
admins, and they could 
suspend this guy’s profile. 
Unfortunately, that’s probably 
as far as the company will 
go: While what he’s doing 
is a crime, Tinder will likely 
want to avoid legal drama 
surrounding incidences of 
catfishing — which, again, 
I assume happen pretty 
often, since I have no faith in 
human decency online.
I suggest you find the fake 
profile and spam him from 
multiple accounts with a 
clip of Kevin Kline from A 
Fish Called Wanda yelling 
“A**hooooooooole!”
Then report him anyway,
Evan Kahn

When you write about the Academy Awards, it’s 
difficult to write about just the awards themselves. 
It’s been a contentious awards season, and the 
drama didn’t stop on Oscar Sunday, Feb. 22.
The red carpet, as always, did not fail to impress. 
Highlights included Anna Kendrick of Pitch Perfect 
and Into the Woods fame, who stunned in a rose-
colored gown. Jennifer Aniston, who has apparently 
not aged since 1998, wore a slim-fitting nude gown, 
playing into the evening’s trend of tasteful, light 
gowns — a turn away from the traditional Oscar 
evening gowns in jewel tones.
Zendaya, a little-known 18-year-old Disney 
Channel actress and singer, became the center of 
a controversy when Fashion Police host Giuliana 
Rancic joked that her dreadlocked hair looked like it 
“smelled like patchouli oil” or “weed.” Zendaya called 
Rancic out for her racist comments on her Instagram; 
Rancic soon apologized and did what all TV hosts do 
best: blamed a writer for the misfired joke.
Academy Awards host Neil Patrick Harris opened 
his monologue by welcoming the Academy’s “best 
and whitest … I mean brightest,” aiming at the 
2015 nominees’ blatant lack of diversity. Although 
it’s good that everyone’s aware of the problem, a 
throwaway joke doesn’t do much toward fixing it.
Lady Gaga also performed at the Oscars, keeping 
up her publicity high after recent engagement to 
B-list Chicago Fire star Taylor Kinney. Gaga’s Sound 
of Music medley impressed many, making the world 
wonder if she’s finally ready to recover from ARTPOP. 
Gaga capitalized on her Oscar performance when 
she announced mid-last week that she will star 
in American Horror Story: Hotel, the show’s fifth 
season.
Among the actual awards, there were few real 
surprises. Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of 
Ignorance) won Best Picture, much to my chagrin 
after I made Boyhood my top pick. It’s still not 
too surprising that Birdman, a film that grittily 
portrays what it feels like to be a faded Hollywood 
elite (something many Academy members are all 
too familiar with) won Best Picture. Birdman also 
rightfully took home Best Cinematography and Best 
Directing.
Best Actor went to Eddie Redmayne for his stirring 
portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of 
Everything; he did a good job of capturing Hawking’s 
chronic motor neuron disorder. Best Supporting 
Actress went to Patricia Arquette for her role in 
Boyhood; Arquette was lauded further after she 
called in her acceptance speech for wage equality for 
women.
Big Hero 6 won best animated feature, a surprise to 
me — truthfully, I think that the award still rightfully 
belongs to the snubbed The Lego Movie, which was 
tossed a scrap of glory when it won Best Original 
Song for the indestructible earworm “Everything Is 
Awesome.”
Julianne Moore won Best Actress for Still Alice, a 
movie that’s been on my watch list for a month, but 
I haven’t had a chance to see yet. J.K. Simmons 
won Best Supporting Actor for Whiplash, in which 
he played a terrifying director of an elite New York 
music school’s jazz band and gave me nightmare 
flashbacks to experiences with my high school 
marching band director.
The Academy Awards are a cyclone of culture, 
media, and fashion, and this year’s Awards ceremony 
was as interesting as any other’s. This year, however, 
it felt a little bit like many of the winners themselves 
were less important than the conversation on race 
and gender equality that played into the event.

Faces of Work preview engages audience
CMU International Film Festival screens fascinating Song from the Forest in McConomy
One of Carnegie Mellon University’s best-kept secrets 
is its annual International Film Festival. The festival, 
this year titled Faces of Work, is the only student-run 
International Film Festival in the country. Most ?lms are 
shown in McConomy Auditorium, but there are some 
other venues around Pittsburgh that will show a few 
of the 18 ?lms being screened. The Festival of?cially 
begins on March 19, but on Friday night in McConomy, 
captivated audiences received with a “sneak preview.”
The main event of the preview was the ?lm Song from 
the Forest. Additionally, the evening consisted of a 
percussion performance led by ethnomusicologist 
and native Congolese Anicet Mundundu, a video 
introduction by director Michael Obert, and a panel 
and reception with distinguished scholars and David 
Rothenberg, the ?lm’s Music Supervisor.
Song from the Forest follows the journey of Louis Sarno, 
an American musicologist, who moved to the Central 
African rainforest after listening to the music of the 
native groups in the region. Sarno has lived among the 
Bayaka, a speci?c tribe of Baka people, for the past 25 
years. The ?lm is essentially an in-depth portrait of the 
Bayaka people, their music, and the man who fell in love 
with their way of life. In the ?lm, Sarno takes his 13-year-
old son Samedi back with him to America for a visit, and 
viewers are able to view the dichotomy between the two 
lifestyles through his eyes.
The ?lm is chock-a-block full of juxtapositions: The 
landscapes of the Central African rainforest and the 
towering skyscrapers of New York City are shocking 
and switched between abruptly; the chaotic-sounding 
polyphonic music of the Bayaka and the synchronized 
polyphony of Renaissance choral music pair in an 
interesting soundtrack; Sarno himself explores the ideas 
of solitude versus community, noise versus silence, and 
black versus white. Song from the Forest raises a lot of 
important questions about society and the meaning of 
life, as audiences are forced to question what makes an 
individual feel at peace.
Sarno came to live with the Bayaka because of their 
music, and thus the ?lm is ?lled with the noises and 
sounds from his home in the Central African forest. 
The ?lm doesn’t just capture the musical traditions 
and performances of the people; it emphasizes the 
music that is present in the everyday lives of these 
hunter gatherers. Children gathering water from the 
river do not hesitate to slap the water in a complex and 
playful rhythm; men taking a break from hunting listen 
and respond to an old man’s song; young boys dance 
naked in a mud puddle as older children around them 
laugh and clap. Even the sounds of the forest, and the 
deafening rain, ?ll audience’s ears as they watch Sarno 
live and work among these people.
Sarno is a complex man whose life is “paradoxical,” as 
panelist David Cronenberg described it after the ?lm. For 
instance, Cronenberg further explained, no one is totally 
sure whether or not Sarno has any money. In the ?lm 
Sarno talks about feeling stressed about the amount of 
debt he has accrued helping the Bayaka build a school  
and get medical attention. He feels guilty because the 
Bayaka always assume that he is able to buy and give 
them things because he is a Westerner, and he isn’t sure 
how to convince them otherwise. However, he ?ies back 
to New York City and buys toys for his son, so his true 
?nancial situation is a little unclear. His brother is very 
wealthy, but the ?nancial relationship between the two 
is never discussed and this lack of dialogue is hugely 
apparent.
At one point toward the end of the ?lm, Sarno and 
Samedi walk down the streets of New York City after 
leaving a toy store, and Samedi is heckling his father 
to buy him a gun. In the moment it seems like any 
young boy asking his father for a gun, which his father 
then denies him. The ?lm’s poignancy comes up a 
few minutes later, as Samedi sits on the edge of a bed 
musing over his toys. He openly expresses annoyance 
with his father, who has little-to-no interest in buying 
Samedi things that will be useful back home. Samedi 
lists some items, like “underwear, shirts, shoes,” as 
well as guns, which would have a major effect on the 
ef?ciency of the Bayaka hunting style. But Sarno is 
disinterested in bringing back such items, and instead 
he buys Samedi a water gun and other toys.
Why is Sarno hesitant to bring back items to aid 
the Bayaka? Why is he so uninterested in any of his 
American family and friends visiting him in the forest? 
These questions delve deep into Sarno’s thinking 
and natural behavior. Sarno’s life in Africa has clearly 
inspired him, and many clips from the movie are 
Sarno’s troubled face, thinking, as well as his occasional 
musings about the Bayaka. He’s self-effacing and self-
absorbed in turn, dismissing Western culture, acting 
somewhat cold toward others, and lavishing praise with 
regularity.
The panelists touched on many of these themes 
throughout the discussion following the ?lm. Sarno’s life 
is an enigma that even the ?lmmakers are still trying to 
understand. After the panel, audience members enjoyed 
a reception in CUC Connan, where they were able to 
snack on delicious Congolese treats.
Many of the movies being screened during the Festival 
have special guest speakers or audience members and 
will be followed by a reception. The 18 ?lms featured 
come from 12 countries around the globe, and will 
introduce a multitude of perspectives. Not only is Song 
from the Forest an excellent ?lm that everyone should 
see, it indicates perfectly that the rest of Carnegie 
Mellon’s International Film Festival will be superb.

On Friday night, The Frame Gallery glowed with the 
words and stories of Carnegie Mellon students. Small, 
square screens and projections stood out against the 
dark night, the only source of light within the gallery. 
The installation show is titled “My Heart Is In The 
Work,” recalling the university’s motto, famously 
penned by Andrew Carnegie. The show explores the 
stress culture perpetuated throughout the Carnegie 
Mellon community. As told by senior communication 
design major Sam Ahmed, who created the show, 
stress culture can be de?ned as “a culture where two 
consecutive all-nighters merits a badge of honor, rather 
than concern.”
Mounted on each wall are grids of screens reminiscent 
of the digital screens many students encounter on a 
daily basis. Columns of square light boxes showed 
social media posts from members of the Carnegie 
Mellon community. While names and faces are 
censored, each post re?ects a student’s struggles or 
successes related to their experience at this university. 
Some student visitors pointed to pieces and chuckled, 
remarking “Look it’s me!” or “I know who posted this.”
“Some of these [posts] are jokes, and some of these are 
legitimately harmless, funny jokes,” Ahmed said. “Some 
of them are maybe more coping mechanisms to hide a 
deeper problem.”
Interspersed throughout the Facebook and Twitter 
posts are quotes printed in large, black letters. The 
quotes are taken from the article, “The happy mask: 
Carnegie Mellon must address stress culture,” written 
by Katie Chironis (DC `12) for The Tartan in 2012.
“[Chironis] wrote the article when I was a sophomore,” 
Ahmed said. “That was the year Henry Armero died, 
and stress culture was a really big issue, and it wasn’t 
talked about as much. And she wrote this amazing 
article that went viral and everybody was posting it. I 
wanted to incorporate that, and I think everyone should 
read it.”
Between the grids of screens are slideshows that 
project unattributed quotes onto the university’s spring 
2014 dean’s lists, which used to adorn the walls of the 
Cohon University Center, statements such as “I’d rather 
stick needles in my eyeballs than come back here,” 
“this isn’t even worth it,” and “I’ve never felt more 
dumb in my life.” Every few minutes, the slideshows 
would turn black and ?ash “are you okay” before 
repeating their cycles.
In the middle of the room is a collection of notes written 
by students. On index cards, many detailed times when 
their stress wasn’t worth it, or times when stress was 
overwhelming yet they felt inclined to continue with 
their work. Others wrote why they felt their struggles 
with stress were worth it in the end.
Introduced to stress culture in high school before 
enrolling at Carnegie Mellon, Ahmed didn’t see that it 
was a problem until he watched his friends struggle. “I 
didn’t realize how bad of an issue it was for me until my 
friends told me that this isn’t how it’s supposed to be,” 
he said. Since enrolling, Ahmed has worked on several 
different projects focusing on stress culture and the 
different ways students express their stress.
Ahmed said that his installation focuses on 
microaggressions: subtle actions that in isolation 
are not too damaging, but when added up 
represent a larger problem in a community. 
“‘[Microaggression]’ is a term that traditionally used to 
describe situations that involve racism, and I’ve taken 
that term to be applicable in a lot of different situations. 
I think in this one, it’s very applicable,” he said.
“I want people to take a closer look at the way they 
communicate with each other, whether that be learning 
to reach out for help or the more subtle things,” Ahmed 
said. “Looking at microaggressions, and seeing 
how when you say something like, ‘Did you do your 
homework?’ and maybe someone’ll reply, ‘No,’ and you 
say, ‘Oh come on, you only have four classes.’ Things 
like that are sometimes okay, but sometimes the person 
really is having a hard time with a reputably easy class, 
or less units, or is just having a hard time. Trying to do 
less of that in our culture would be a good way to start 
addressing the problem.”
“My Heart Is In The Work” will be on display at The 
Frame through March 7.

speaker
pillbox 03.02.157
This past week, students on campus were #blessed with 
the rare opportunity to receive wisdom of all sorts from 
rapper, motivational speaker, and social media legend 
Lil B.
His lecture covered a wide span of topics, ranging from 
awareness (listen to your “spider senses”), identity 
(“a mouse raised by pigeons”), and ambitions (“Goals, 
dedication, meditation”).
Lil B’s lecture was focused on three quotes that he 
prepared especially for the Carnegie Mellon community. 
The ?rst tied in well with his introduction. He started out 
his lecture by welcoming “you guys,” but then corrected 
himself to add women, and then people who may not 
identify with either categorization. His ?rst quote goes, 
“You are what you choose to identify with. You have the 
choice. A mouse raised by pigeons.”
While the metaphor is perhaps a little bit strange, the 
takeaway was worthwhile. He emphasized that who we 
are as individuals doesn’t come from labels, especially 
those imposed by others onto us. Who we are comes 
from who or what we want to be. Lil B also encouraged 
audience members to learn the power of empathy — 
since everybody has a past and their own individual 
struggles, it is important to lift each other up and be 
understanding no matter what. He gestured out to all the 
students in McConomy auditorium, imploring everyone 
to support each other. “We’re not alone,” he said.
His second quote ushered the lecture into its next phase. 
This also coincided with the dramatic climax of his 
speech. His other quotes were more verbose, but in this 
one, he favored concision while showing off his lyrical 
know-how. Pausing for emphasis between each word, 
Lil B had the audience in silent anticipation. “Goals. 
Dedication. Meditation,” he announced. The takeaway 
from this quote was one that Carnegie Mellon students 
especially need to be reminded of. Lil B told us to set 
goals and stay dedicated to them, which most Tartans 
are very good at, but the meditation is key. We need to 
re?ect on the progress we’ve made, understand and 
learn from mistakes, reward ourselves for successes, 
and allow ourselves to recharge. While Carnegie Mellon 
students are constantly setting and working toward 
goals, they often forget to meditate and re?ect. Lil B 
emphasized this part over the others, and hopefully 
students will take it to heart.
Lil B’s third and ?nal quote dealt with change: “Symbols 
of hate have now become beacons of hope and love. We 
have to accept the new to understand what’s coming 
ahead and continue to be inquisitive with the status 
quo.” While he never exactly de?ned which symbols 
he was referring to, the bottom line is still meaningful. 
Nothing in this world is concrete, and things will always 
change. We must continue to accept the changes that 
life will inevitably bring and adapt. Lil B also used this 
as an opportunity to warn placing too much value in 
material things. The most important thing is that we’re 
alive, and we can’t forget that.
While many of the lessons Lil B brought to Carnegie 
Mellon are ones that we’ve probably heard before, his 
delivery is what made them unique. It felt as though Lil 
B showed up as Brandon McCartney, a real person, and 
not Lil B the Based God, a persona. Aside from remarks 
like “We’re all stars, not just me” and “All of my work is 
great,” Lil B addressed the audience on a very human 
level. He offered up lessons that are meaningful to him. 
The sincerity that persisted throughout the evening was 
really what made his lessons special.

Frank Underwood is back
House of Cards fans in for another thrilling and tense season
I thought it impossible to best last year's shocking opening 
episode to season two of House of Cards. I was wrong. Even 
before the credits and the absurdly long theme song opened 
season three, Frank Underwood had already shocked and 
scandalized, urinating on his father's gravestone. Seriously, 
is there anything that's holy to this monster?
But I settled in to watch anyway, because like any other 
addict to this Netflix original blockbuster, I love to hate 
these characters. And hate them I do, especially after epi-
sode one (or, as Netflix snootily calls it, chapter 27). Instead 
of picking up literally seconds after the end of the previous 
season as it did last year, season three plunges us deep into 
a world where Underwood has been president for months 
and is in the middle of a standoff against Congress. (Hmm, 
why does that sound familiar?).
The show helps us to catch up through the life of 
Underwood's loyal aide Doug, who disappointingly did not 
bite the dust deep in the Maryland woods and is working on 
healing wounds both inside and out. We find that Claire is 
batting cleanup for her husband Francis (what else is new?) 
and she's getting tired of it, ready to make a go of her own 
at the political world (finally). Things don't seem good any-
where, from the bedrooms of the West Wing, where conten-
tion brews, to Doug's house — where he self-medicates 
with drugs, alcohol, and prostitutes — to the fictionalized 
Middle East, where the U.S. is busy killing opposition lead-
ers while they should be negotiating.
The first episode was confusing: Well over half of it focused 
on Doug and his depression following the accident at the 
end of season two. In fairness, director John Coles had a lot 
to remind us about after the whirlwind of computer hack-
ing, lesbian ex-prostitutes, lawsuits, and betrayals in which 
season two ended. Why choose to hook us in with Doug, a 
character who, at least in my eyes, has nary a redeeming 
quality to speak of?
As usual, the show is a masterpiece that's beautifully 
planned, if stressful, to watch. The music, composed by 
genius Jeff Beal, is one of the most attractive parts of the 
show. It's the icing on the cake that sets the scene for 
the rest of the show tonally — a beautiful complement to 
the breathtaking cinematography. The first episode was 
a strong and quiet start to a season that promises more 
drama, backstabbing, game-playing, life-ruining, and plot-
twisting. This trend brings to mind one important question: 
Is this a sustainable model for such a drama-fueled story-
line?
While the writers of the show have yet to disappoint us, the 
intense satisfaction of the show doesn't feel like it can go 
on forever. Just how many kind-of-main-characters can you 
kill before we start predicting the deaths? And when will it 
end? The first two seasons showed Francis’s and Claire's 
fast-paced, cutthroat rise to power, but now that he's presi-
dent, many fans, myself included, are wondering where we 
have to go from here. There are only so many positions that 
would be more exciting than leader of the free world, and 
let's be honest: Dictator of the world involves a little too 
much suspension of disbelief.
The world will certainly be watching as Netflix decides 
where to take the award-winning show next. Regardless of 
their other successful franchises, House of Cards remains a 
focal point. Where the show goes and how it gets there will 
set a precedent for Netflix-exclusive content, as well as for 
just how far a political drama can go.

women
pillbox 03.02.159
Mindy Kaling (top left), creator of The Mindy Project, 
stars in her show as Mindy Lahiri, an obstetrician who 
faces tough decisions about life, love, career, and fam-
ily in a ridiculous and absurd comedy.
Everyone searches to find a little bit of themselves in a 
television character. Historically, women have struggled 
with this, because there have been few types of female 
characters on screen. The roles of women on television 
have lacked racial and religious diversity. They have 
lacked diversity of lifestyle interests, sexual orientation, 
physical appearance, and diversity in the ways in which 
they think and feel. Even characters who have been 
hailed as breaths of fresh air have been overshadowed 
by the homogeneity of their industry counterparts. This 
is not to say that there haven’t been terrific characters 
played by talented actresses over the years, but we now 
live in a time where some audiences are cognizant of 
the lack of diversity. There have been significant steps 
to improve representation on television. While there are 
still tons of women who are not represented on screen, 
there are a few current characters that are inspirational to 
women for being honest, complex, and relatable.
Coming off an awards season that featured controver-
sial statements from Patricia Arquette about the issues 
women face in America, as well as statements from other 
stars about the increasing representation of women on 
screen, it is important to take a moment to reflect on the 
state of women in television and the increasing diversity 
of their characters.
One of the most eloquent explanations of the positive 
female-character trend in TV was spoken by actress 
Maggie Gyllenhaal upon receiving the Golden Globe 
for Best Actress in a Miniseries or TV Movie. She said, 
“when I look around the room at the women who are here 
and think about the performances that I’ve watched this 
year, what I see actually are women who are sometimes 
powerful and sometimes not, sometimes sexy, sometimes 
not, sometimes honorable, sometimes not, and what I 
think is new is the wealth of roles for actual women in 
television and in film. That’s what I think is revolutionary 
and evolutionary and it’s what’s turning me on.” That is 
the kind of progress that has been made in television over 
the past couple of years.
Oftentimes, people search for the evidence of diversifica-
tion of roles by lauding roles where women have positions 
of power. But as Gyllenhaal stated, true character diver-
sity stems from the depiction of women with real flaws, 
and diverse priorities and lifestyles.
The rise of female characters in leadership, however, 
should not be downplayed. It is vital to see career-minded 
women on screen. Notable characters that demonstrate 
women in leadership include Parks and Recreation’s 
Leslie Knope, Mindy from The Mindy Project, Olivia Pope 
from Scandal, Liz Lemon from 30 Rock, and Annalise 
Keating from How to Get Away with Murder. All of these 
shows have created characters with whom other women 
identify.
As a college student, it has been interesting for me to see 
shows that explore the complexities of life after gradu-
ationtrying to find a path that doesn’t necessarily require 
marriage or children. It is interesting to watch women as 
successful leaders and mothers, but it is hugely illustra-
tive to watch a young woman navigate her path, making 
mistakes and great choices in life and love as she tries 
to determine what her dreams are. A show that does 
just this is Lena Dunham’s Girls on HBO. Now a couple 
of seasons in, Dunham’s characters continue to struggle 
and find their passions. Comedy Central’s Broad City also 
follows the lives of its two protagonists as they try to live 
out their dream in New York City, encountering obstacles 
and triumphing over them.
Netflix’s Orange is the New Black is another show that 
has been commended for the diversity of its female char-
acters. One of few shows to examine women’s sexuality 
in depth, Orange is the New Black allows audiences to 
see the vulnerabilities and strengths of flawed, and in this 
case incarcerated, women. How to Get Away with Murder 
also explores themes wherein female characters have to 
walk a morally ambiguous line and make the best choice 
of the options presented. These shows represent the mul-
tifaceted nature of all women and the messy choices that 
everyone has to make.
The women in all of these programs are aspirational, 
instructive, and fascinating figures, but are also still rela-
tively limited in their demographic representations. They 
are mostly college-educated women from supportive, mid-
dle- to upper-class families who interact with other highly 
educated people. A huge majority are heterosexual. Very 
few shows delve into the religious quandaries and beliefs 
of the characters.
This is not to say that female representation on television 
is waning. It has grown and improved significantly, even 
in the last decade. In the past year, shows such as Orphan 
Black have portrayed transgender and homosexual female 
characters. Television shows continue to bring more racial 
diversity to screen. However there is a long way to go to 
success. There are significant gaps and experiences that 
are not yet shown on screen. But as society aims to right 
this, let’s not forget that television has been introducing 
us to more nuanced, developed characters. We hope to see 
more shows move in this direction.

10a cappella
pillbox 03.02.15
On Friday night, a cappella enthusiasts from around 
Carnegie Mellon, around Pittsburgh, and even a handful from 
Michigan gathered in McConomy Auditorium to watch their 
favorite groups compete in the Great Lakes International 
Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) quarter?nals. 
McConomy was full to bursting, with individuals standing 
in the back and lining the stairs. Completely unintentionally, 
I managed to ?nd a seat in the row where all the judges, 
scorekeepers, and timekeepers sat. Under their book lights, 
the judges scribbled furiously on clipboards during the 
performances, analyzing each of the ten groups’ strengths 
and weaknesses in a variety of categories.
The evening of a cappella craziness was hosted by 
Carnegie Mellon’s very own Brad Plaxen, a senior electrical 
and computer engineering and English double major. 
Having been an MC for other events on campus, Plaxen 
seemed comfortable addressing the huge audience. While 
introducing the show, Plaxen got the audience guffawing 
after preparing them to hear “a lot of top 40 songs from the 
last three months that you’re tired of. A lot of Taylor Swift. 
Actually that’s uncon?rmed, but she’s actually here tonight, 
here in McConomy. Taylor Swift just loves a cappella.” 
Ridiculous quips like this had the audience giggling and 
kept the energy light throughout the over-three-hour-long 
show.
Each group was limited to 12 minutes’ worth of a cappella 
glory. Plaxen made numerous comments about keeping the 
clapping between songs to a minimum in order to expedite 
each set. The ?rst group of the evening — and the only 
group from out of state — speci?cally asked for no applause 
until the end, as their set was timed to ?ll the 12 minutes 
almost exactly. The Gold Vibrations, a co-ed a cappella 
group from Oakland University in Rochester Hills, Michigan, 
performed a lively set including the current toe-tapping 
favorite, Mark Ronson’s “Uptown Funk” featuring Bruno 
Mars.
With charming choreography and sets that seemed to be 
pulled off seamlessly, even the littlest mistakes could ruin a 
group’s chances to take home a coveted prize or advance 
to the semi?nals. The second group, the University of 
Pittsburgh’s C Flat Run, included the ?rst soloist of the 
evening who sent chills up my spine. His rendition of 
“Supremacy” by Muse sent his voice soaring to incredible 
high notes.
The evening was full of knock-your-socks-off talent, as well 
as plenty of funny moments and numbers. The University of 
Pittsburgh’s Pitt Pendulums arranged Miley Cyrus’s “Party in 
the USA” to merge into other numbers such as “New York” 
and “Oops I Did it Again” before each chorus. I always ?nd 
men giving their all while singing vintage Britney Spears to 
be enjoyable and highly entertaining.
The ?rst Carnegie Mellon group of the evening stunned 
with another inspired arrangement. Counterpoint, the only 
all-female a cappella group at Carnegie Mellon, had the 
genius idea of pairing Beyonce’s “Crazy in Love” with Gnarls 
Barkley’s “Crazy.” Their performance also included a rousing 
“Summertime Sadness” by Lana del Rey and a wonderful 
version of Katy Perry’s “Dark Horse” (replete with Jessie J’s 
rap).
Pittch Please, an all-male a cappella group from University 
of Pittsburgh — and the ?rst-place winners of the evening 
— earned the audience’s respect and admiration with a 
variety of ?awlessly arranged and executed songs. The 
soloist who sang Jessie J’s part in Bang Bang performed tons 
of animation and impressive intonation as his voice slipped 
and slid over the runs and performed vocal gymnastics. 
Pittch Please’s staging was also perfect: entertaining, but 
not at the expense of the vocals. At one point the members 
pretended to be various instruments.
The other two Carnegie Mellon groups to perform took 
the stage by storm. The Originals, an all-male ensemble, 
delivered a complex and majestic performance. One of the 
most enjoyable moments of the evening was the mash-up of 
jazzy-blues ballad “Cry Me a River” with Justin Timberlake’s 
popular song of the same name. Freshman musical theatre 
major Kyle Pitts performed the ballad — famously covered 
by jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald — soulfully, as the rest of 
the group backed him up with spunky lines from Justin 
Timberlake’s version.
Carnegie Mellon’s co-ed group The Treblemakers performed 
a set that showed off their ability to perform melodic and 
fast-paced number with ease. Senior BXA student Bridget 
McCoy delivered a beautiful version of Rihanna’s “Stay” 
and sophomore psychology major Reagan Henke sang 
Calvin Harris’ “Sweet Nothing” with an amazing amount of 
power and emotion. Entertaining and impressive dancing 
accompanied the vocals, so it was no surprise that The 
Treblemakers took home the award for best choreography.
The evening was certainly long, but it was hard to complain 
when there was the opportunity to watch so many talented 
people doing what they love. If you didn’t feel sorry for 
yourself regarding your personal singing talent, the funny 
bios of each group in the program de?nitely made you feel 
substantially less cool. During the period before the winners 
were announced, the audience was entertained with 
performances from Infra Dance Company and improv troupe 
No Parking Players.
Carnegie Mellon groups won all of the prizes except ?rst 
prize. Second prize went to The Originals, and third prize 
went to the Treblemakers. In addition to winning best 
choreography, Bridget McCoy of the Treblemakers won Best 
Soloist. Junior global studies major Diana Pacilio won Best 
Vocal Percussion for Counterpoint, and composition major 
Stephen Murphy won Best Arrangement for The Originals.
All in all, the ICCA quarter?nals once again blew the 
audience away with their whirlwind of vocal majesty.
