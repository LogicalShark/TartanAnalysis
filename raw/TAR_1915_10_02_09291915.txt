The resignation this summer of 
Fred E. Foster, ’08, graduate manager 
of athletic and non-athletic activities, 
has left matters in a rather chaotic 
state, especially as far as the athletic 
affairs go. The constitution of the 
Athletic Association requires the O. K. 
of that official for every important ac­
tion and decision of the managers of 
the various teams, so that the vacancy 
in the position makes orderly pro­
cedure difficult and almost impossible.
The election of anyone to fill the 
position will be impossible before Oc­
tober 15th, due to the rule regulating 
the make-up of the Athletic Board of 
Control. A representative from each 
school, day and night, is to be elected 
as well as a member from each alumni 
association. Since night school does 
not begin until October 2nd, action 
before the above date will be impos­
sible.
There will be three different solu­
tions to the difficulty. One is to elect 
a full time man as before to manage 
both kinds of activities, or a part time 
man may be elected to manage ath­
letics only, or, thirdly, the old sys­
tem of no graduate manager may be 
reverted to. This last is certainly to 
be avoided, as it throws too much 
work and responsibility on the student 
managers and leaves no one to con­
tinue any set policy from year to year. 
All progressive institutions of any size 
recognized this fact long ago and pro­
vided such a position as graduate man­
ager to direct the policy and business 
of the Athletic Association. In the 
event of a part time man being elect­
ed, the Student Activities Committee 
would probably elect another man to 
manage their affairs.
It will be difficult to obtain anyone 
who will fill the position as Foster 
filled it. Founder of the Tartan and 
Thistle and captain of the football 
team when in school, he filled the job 
with the same push and vim that he

The boss of the building bureau, 
commonly and universally known as 
“Scotty” has prophesied that the In­
dustry Building extension will be 
ready for occupancy in four weeks 
and the wings in the Design School 
by Thanksgiving. Since Mr. Scott’s 
reputation as a prophet.has never been 
impeached, nay, hasn’t even the slight­
est taint, those interested can rest 
easy and consider the matter settled.
As soon as the roof is completely on 
the Industry wing, the glass will be 
put in and the plasterers will go to 
work. Work on this building has 
been held up due to lack of granite, 
the contractors not living up to speci­
fications as to shipment. However, 
one of the draughting rooms is nearly 
ready for occupancy now and the 
others soon will be. The brick shop 
in the basement will also soon be in 
a condition to permit work by the 
students.
The Design wings are waiting on 
terra cotta which was to be shipped 
the twentieth of this month. Trouble 
has also been had over the specifica­
tions of this material and has caused 
much delay. The tile roof will be fin­
ished as soon as the skylights arrive. 
This will permit the plasterers to go 
to work and the floors to be laid when 
the interior rooms will be ready for

The Morewood avenue dormitory 
was a scene of much hilarity last Sat­
urday night when the "old girls” en­
tertained the Plebes at a “Backwards” 
party. Everybody came dressed as a 
little girl or a little boy and wore their 
costumes backwards. Being a “back­
wards party” the eats were served 
first with the last course first and a 
napkin at the end. This was followed 
by several selected pieces by the or­
chestra, consisting of the Misses 
Wright, Sanford, McClelland, Thomp­
son, W. Irwin, and S. Smith, who 
played with their backs to the leader, 
Miss Florence Burgham.
Next Miss Dorothy Davis was pre­
sented with a beautifully wiggly alli­
gator for winning the suit case race— 
after which the race took place. Miss 
Ruth Congrove received a handsome 
pastry set for winning the pie-eating 
contest and Miss Betty Johnson won 
the peanut race.
Dancing followed. Finally each 
“old girl” was introduced by a Plebe 
to the receiving line—Miss Colling- 
wTood, Mrs. Seigle, and Miss Sanford— 
and then still eating lollypops each 
“tired but happy little girl” told each 
“tired but happy little boy” goodnight 
at the foot of the stairs and everybody 
promised everybody else that they’d 
have another one just like it some 
time again.

A new tradition, in Design School, 
was inaugurated last night when the 
Design faculty and upperclassmen 
welcomed the new men and women to 
Carnegie. The reception took place 
in the exhibition room at 8:00 o’clock. 
A joyous time was indulged in.
Henry Hornbostel introduced the 
faculty and short talks followed by 
each. Each class gave a short sketch 
which was extremely interesting. The 
drama students gave an exhibition in 
dancing which was indeed excellent. 
The music students also rendered 
quite a number of selections.
Refreshments were served and gen 
eral dancing on the corridor in which 
all participated. The student recep­
tion committee was on hand all even­

Membership Increased To Nearly 
Fifty. Proposed Trip To Cleve­

Assured.
The prospects for.a most successful 
band look brighter than ever this 
year. The call for candidates has 
met with such response as far ex­
ceeds the most sanguine hopes of the 
management and leader. The artists 
of the various brass instruments who 
have reported to date are of. a calibre 
which would make Sousa envious, not 
to mention Director Sullivan himself.
We are more than glad to receive 
such encouraging news from the band 
management, inasmuch as a first class 
band is of inestimable value to the 
success of any football season. Few 
of us probably appreciate just to what 
a measure the spirit and enthusiasm 
evidenced at a football game are due

Last Saturday Thiel College of 
Greenville, Pa., under the tutelage of 
Coach Rowley, an old Dickinson man, 
went down in defeat before the Tech 
warriors in a game devoid of any 
startling or thrilling features. The 
character of play was all straight, old- 
fashioned football with the exception 
of a few shifts and attempts at for­
ward passes. The most brilliant work 
of the game was the blocking of two 
punts that resulted in two touchdowns 
for the home team. We believe 
Fletcher perpetrated these deeds, al­
though Hellstrom and McFeaters 
were so close and at this particular 
time everybody was moving so fast 
it was difficult to ascertain just where 
to place the credit. McFeaters re­
covered both of the blocked kicks over 
the enemy’s goal line, scoring two of 
our four touchdowns, an unusual per­
formance for a tackle. We hope he 
will continue throughout the season. 
The work of these boys in the line 
assisted by the flawdess defensive play 
of Captain Lauer on the end should 
tend to unify the play of the whole 
line which at times was erratic and in­
consistent and appeared to be the 
greatest weakness of the team as well 
as it’s strong feature at a few particu­
lar points of the game.
Finley, Altdorfer and Marshal in 
the backfield under the sometimes 
doubtful “generalship” of Mcoorlev— 
our quarterback on short notice—show 
all the desirable features of a strong 
offensive and defensive backfield— 
speed, weight, strength and skill and 
above all, judgment. Finley and 
Marshal do some excellent gaining 
around the ends and strong and de­
cided interference which is a most im­
portant feature in the modern game. 
Altdorfer plunges through the line 
with speed and strength and is a sure 
ground-gainer at critical times—a good

FACULTY ARTICLES.
One of the features of the Tartan 
during the present year will be the 
publication of articles of importance 
and interest dealing with various 
phases of college life and student ac­
tivities, to be written by members of 
our faculty. We have at present se­
cured a number of articles for this fea­
ture, and the publication of this series 
of articles will be commenced at an 
early date, possibly beginning with the 
next issue. An announcement will be 
made the previous week regarding the 
author and the subject to be discussed 
in the next issue. We feel very proud 
of this feature and trust that these ar­
ticles will receive due attention from 
the student body. We do not need to 
fear that they will meet with utmost 
approval, for each article contains 
thoughts and ideas which will be of 
great value to plebe and senior alike.
We have members in our faculty 
whose training and experience puts 
them in a position to give to the stu­
dent such thought and ideals, and to 
point out such causes of action in 
everyday life as will be of the utmoat 
value to him.
These articles will be one of the 
opportunities presented during your 
stay at Tech, which you cannot af­
ford to miss, and if you do not read 
them vou may justly say that you are 
deaf to the “knocking of opportun­
ity.” Such articles as these have 
formed the subject matter for im­
portant lectures which have been de­
livered and gratefully received by 
other audiences than Tech students. 
Others of these articles embody the 
principles and very kernel of the 
qualities which have made for suc­
cess in the respective lives followed 
by the particular faculty member. Re­
member too, that there are big men 
and women in our faculty. Tech has 
not made its phenomenal growth in 
ten years without the aid of a fac­
ulty whose standard is only of the 
highest.
We therefore recommend to every 
Tech student that these articles shall 
be thoroughly read and digested. This 
series of articles is alone worth far 
more than the entire cost of your sub­
scription.
TO THE PLEBES.
You are now away from home and 
have taken upon yourself a responsi­
bility which heretofore you have not 
found the need of. It is a good time 
to establish certain fundamental prin­
ciples to guide you through your new 
life, to cast out the qualities which 
you have found to be a hindrance and 
to form habits which you know would 
be an asset.
You should not make promises has­
tily, but observe sacredly even the 
smallest one, for if you mean to keep 
your promises you can not afford to 
make many.
Be very careful of every statement 
you make. Let accuracy and frank­
ness be your guide.
When doing work in the interest of 
your alma mater, make yourself ob­
scure, but by industry and fidelity 
make yourself a necessity. Above all, 
avoid selfishness.
Keep your own standard high. Be 
strict with yourself but lenient with 
others.
Cultivate the power of concentra­
tion and be constant and persevering 
with your own business.
Be interested in all your undertak­
ings. Interest in your work, seasoned 
with enthusiasm, is the key to effi­
ciency.
There are two more factors which 
go a long way toward making your 
career a successful one. These are 
politeness and tact. The possession 
of these qualities not only makes life 
more comfortable for yourself but for 
all with whom you come in contact.
WHY YOU SHOULD SUBSCRIBE 
TO AND SUPPORT THE 
TARTAN.
First—The publication keeps you 
posted on current school events; sec­
ond, creates school spirit; third, boosts 
Carnegie Tech; fourth, one means of 
aiding your activities; fifth, gets new 
men and women acquainted with 
school traditions; sixth, keeps our 
alumni posted on present develop­
ments, news and kindles a new “Car­
negie spirit” on their part.
The Tartan is not a “money-mak- 
ing” scheme, it “breaks even.” No 
department, school or faction dic­
tates its policy. Our aim is to give 
you your school news as early and 
complete as possible. Each depart­
ment will be well covered by an en­
larged staff. Special attention will be 
given to athletics, fraternity and sor­
ority news, clubs, society doings and 
alumni news. A calendar of remind­
ers of school events appears in every 
issue, letters from your faculty on the 
school and rts government.
We beg the alumni to support us. 
“A college is measured by the calibre 
of its alumni.” Carnegie will pros­
per like other colleges if the alumni 
will continue their interest. The Tar­
tan aims to help you do the same. 
Alumni notes will be thankfully re­
ceived.
Contribution boxes are to be placed 
as soon as possible in all buildings. 
News items especially, jokes, class­
room sayings, announcements and 
criticisms are solicited.
Today is “Tartan Day!” Get tag­
ged and show that you believe in a 
better Tech and better activities. A 
banner will be given to the person 
holding the lucky number in each 
school and a cushion to the Margaret 
Morrison girl. Watch for the lucky 
number, it may be the same as the 
one on your subscription card.
Buy your subscription now. With­
out your aid and support the paper 
will be a failure. Make it the best 
ever. See what your support will do!
COLLEGE MAN’S FRANCHISE.
“The season of class and club elec­
tions is at hand and once more we are 
reminded of the lack of interest of 
some men. Just like party elections 
there is a large class of men who do 
not exercise the privilege of their 
franchise. Class meeting after class 
meeting, election after election, a 
large portion of the class, usually 
fifty to sixty per cent, are content to 
attend the amusements in the city 
without approaching the scene of the 
meeting. The interest that a man 
takes in his class may be as a means 
for determining his interest in the 
school as a whole.”
“If some men were deprived of this 
privilege they would feel that they 
were terribly mistreated, yet having 
the privilege they fail to use it. An 
election to office carries with it the 
confidence of the class in the man. 
But the confidence, if measured by 
the percentage of those who vote, is 
very small.”
“Every man in school will be called 
upon shortly to make his choice for 
class officers. In spite of this edi­
torial a large number will go on in 
their same uninterested way, but re­
member if you are one of them you 
are building up a habit which is re­
sponsible for the existence of our ma­
chine-ridden politics.”
AT LAST!
The grandstand on Tech Field has 
been slightly repaired by the admin­
istration. These have been in bad re­
pair for some time and should be 
taken better care of by all concern­
ed. It is hoped in the very near fu­
ture we shall have a grandstand and 
bleachers that shall not rot and be 
of a more permanent nature.
CLUB NEWS.
The clubs of Carnegie are re­
quested to have their secretaries put 
advance notices of their meetings in 
The Tartan. Let everyone know what 
you are doing. Help boost Tech by 
showing your activity.
WAYNESBURG NEXT SATURDAY
Continued from Page 1 
not mean, however, that Waynesburg 
is an easy opponent, for we were held 
to a 0-0 score in 1910, and at no time 
until last year have we ever won by 
more than three touchdowns. Last 
season they were our opponents in the 
opening game of the season and Coach 
Steffen’s men rolled up a score of 
55-0. This year, however, they are an 
uncertain quantity as nothing can be 
learned as to the strength of their 
team.
Our team should be hitting its stride 
much better by next Saturday. The 
most embarrassing position is that of 
quarter. Undoubtedly our score in 
Saturday’s game would have been 
much larger had better generalship 
been shown. McSorley, a former E. 
L. A. man, who played quarter for the 
Penn Freshmen last year, was rather 
inexperienced as he had not directed 
the first squad to any great extent last 
week and was evidently rather excited 
and rattled. This, of course, slowed 
up the whole team and caused much 
evident confusion. Let everyone pray 
that someone will see light and that 
Kesner will be in next Saturday’s 
game.
The end positions will be well taken 
care of. Both did very well Saturday, 
especially in getting down under 
punts. Levy and Beatty from Stetson 
University will both be in uniform this 
week. The line needs strengthening 
on the right side, as Thiel continually 
ran tackle plays for gains of five yards 
or more. From the stand it looked as 
though the tackle was playing a little 
too high and was waiting too long 
before running in. As to the charging 
when Thiel punted, the work was ex­
cellent. Kutz played a strong game 
at tackle during part of the second 
half.
As to the back field, no comment 
is necessary, their excellent work be­
ing too evident. Given a few more 
chances at line plunging and the re­
sults would have been much better. 
Altdoefer’s first punt which measured 
fifty-six yards, created a great im­
pression in the stands. It was high 
and forced the opposing quarterback 
to his goal line, where our ends 
pounced on him at once.
So it will be with eagerness that 
everyone will turn out Saturday to see 
the result of this week's practice. The 
team should be wonderfully improved 
and should also begin to acquire much 
speed as well as strength.
West Virginia, who will be our op­
ponents in two weeks, plays W. & J. 
next Saturday. Coach Folwell’s ag­
gregation will have to look to their 
laurels as the Panhandlers held Penn 
to 7-0, while Geneva, with almost the 
same team as last year, held W. & J. 
to 6-0. Both games were won on a 
forward pass, in which department we 
did not shine last week.

FUTURE EXTENSION PLANS.
Head House on Science Building and 
Gymnasium.
The latest developments in the ex­
tension plans of our group are the 
head house for the Science building, 
gymnasium and stadium. The plans 
for the above are now being studied in 
the building bureau and a definite 
understanding will be formulated at 
an early date.
As it stands the studies call for a 
complete unit at the east end of the 
Science building. It shall have direct 
connection to the Morewood avenue 
bridge and gymnasium. It shall house 
the administrative officers of that 
school. At present the studies have 
an auditorium seating approximately 
one thousand to fifteen hundred. The 
entrance to the above will be on 
street level. A balcony and roomp 
stage are to be provided. The idea 
is not entirely settled at this date.
In a previous issue we explained the 
plans for gymnasium and stadium. 
Another wing is to be placed on the 
Margaret Morrison School in the rear. 
The stadium will be extended entirely 
around the field, connecting with the 
girls’ schools. At the opposite end 
from the girls’ school the gymnasium 
will be placed on the bridge connect­
ing Forbes street and Tech Parkway 
(Woodlawn Avenue).
The above bridge is an extension 
of Morewood avenue. At the south 
end Mr. Hornbostel has the idea of a 
huge triumphal arch surmounted by 
a tower. This tower would take the 
place of the administration building 
planned to be placed on the present 
tennis court. It would house exactly 
what the other was planned to do, 
possibly an auditorium, offices of the 
administration, restaurant, teachers’ 
college, etc. The telescope would be 
placed on an observatory on the top.
Such plans are not quite definite 
but are to be worked out in a short 
time. By the time our present build­
ing operations are finished the plans 
for our new will be in operation.
DORM. NOTES.
Director Hamerschlag is anxious to 
secure appropriate names for the two 
dormitory buildings. Any students 
having suggestions might notify the 
Tartan of the same.
Every bed in the East Dorm, is now 
occupied, but several students have 
not as yet moved into their rooms in 
the other building. The football men 
moved into the training quarters on 
the third floor last week.
Furniture for the club rooms is due 
to arrive this week. This will be after 
the style of that in the Carnegie Un­
ion, though not quit» as luxurious.
Everyone is anxiously awaiting the 
desk lamps, the ceiling light being 
hardly bright enough to allow study­
ing without an accompanying strain 
on the eyes.
Representatives from each floor in 
the two buildings have been elected to 
draw up a form of government for the 
dorm, occupants. J. Guter, '16, is 
chairman of the committee.
SOUTHERN CLUB HOLDS 
SMOKER.
Housewarming for New Home.
The members of the Southern Club 
held an “open house” on last Friday 
evening at their new club house, 5072 
Forbes street.
All Southern men were invited, 
many responding to their cordial in­
vitation. Including Professor Mc- 
Goodwin of the Design School and 
Mr. McCorkle of the Science School, 
both of whom have been loyal mem­
bers of that organization since its in­
ception. The club’s intention is to 
promote a better scholastic and social 
welfare of the members of this re­
gional club. And every effort is being 
made by those interested to accom­
plish a practical end.
An invitation is extended to all 
Southern men themselves and those 
whose efforts stand for a better rela­
tionship between Southern men and 
Carnegie Tech. The club proposes in 
the near future to have an “open 
house” for all the clubs, fraternities 
and faculty of Carnegie, and assure a 
hearty Southern welcome to all.
STUDENT FIRMS PUT OUT OF 
BUSINESS.
No Candy or Tobacco To Be Sold in 
Buildings.
August 27, 1915.
Dr. A. A. Hamerschlag,
Director, Carnegie Institute 
of Technology,
Pittsburgh, Penna.
Dear Sir:—
Your committee entrusted with the 
duty of inquiring into the advisability 
of allowing or prohibiting the sale, by 
students, in the different buildings of 
the Institute, of candies or tobacco or 
both, begs to report that it unanimous­
ly stands against the practice which 
obtained last year and recommends 
that the sale of candies or tobacco be 
absolutely prohibited in any part of 
the buildings of the Carnegie Insti­
tute of Technology, for the following 
reasons:
1. Because of the undoubted detri­
mental effect that indiscriminate in­
gestion of foodstuffs has on health.
2. Because the sale of smoking ar­
ticles to minors is prohibited by law 
in the State of Pennsylvania, a fine 
or imprisonment or both being the 
penalty for offense. The Anti-cigar­
ette Law is only a few years old but 
we have been told on authority which 
is reliable that a law seventeen years 
old is on the statutes prohibiting the 
sale of any smoking article to a minor. 
As it would be next to impossible for 
the school authorities to see that only 
students twenty-one years old were 
sold tobacco, cigars or cigarettes for 
their own consumption we believe 
that a rigid enforcement of the regu­
lation which we recommend is the 
only safe means at our disposal.

RADIO CLUB EXPANDING.
Plans To Complete Station by the 
First of the Year.
The first meeting of the Radio Club, 
Tech’s organization of wireless en­
thusiasts, resulted in nine new men 
being added to the club’s roster. The 
get-together meeting which was held 
in the club’s Machinery Hall tower 
room on Wednesday, September 23, 
at 7:30 in the evening consisted prin­
cipally in the president, D. L. Traut- 
man, welcoming the new men.
The additional members, L. Eisen- 
state and H. Goldberg, Soph. Elec.,
F. M. Reynolds, Soph. Irreg., H. Da­
vis, R. W. Culverhouse, R. L. Bunker, 
L. Castonquay, A. H. Krieger, and C. 
K. Little, Plebes, were all from the 
Science School, although the mem­
bership of the club is open to men 
from all the schools. About twelve 
old men are back in school.
The big thing for the club this year 
will be their January meeting at which 
in connection with the C. I. T. branch 
of the A. I. E. E., they will entertain 
the Pittsburgh section of this national 
engineer’s association at their regular 
monthly meeting. Plans are being 
formed so that the occasion may be a 
memorable one for all concerned.
At this time, also they expect that 
their full station will be completed. 
Now there lies at Shadyside station, 
the important parts of their powerful 
sending set which has been purchased 
from the G. E. people of Schenectady. 
As soon as the school authorities 
bring the power up to their club room 
the sending set can be completed. 
The receiving set has been designed 
by Dr. Van Dyck of the electrical en­
gineering staff, and all will be made 
by club members working from the 
crude materials with the exception of 
the audions which will be purchased 
complete. What the club now needs 
is men who will work on winding 
these coils.
This year the club is working under 
their new constitution which provides 
for an initiation fee of one dollar, and 
monthly dues of twenty-five cents with 
penalties of fines, suspension, and ex­
pulsion for non-payment, misuse of 
club property, and conduct unbecom­
ing a member. The full constitution 
will appear later in these columns.
The present officers of the club are:
D. L. Trautman, President.
C. T. Fletcher, Vice President.
W. W. Troutman, Secretary.
G. G. Greulich, Treasurer.
Directors: G. A. Kaufman, E. G. 
Hamilton, W. L. Handly.
The regular meetings of the club 
are held on the second Thursday even­
ing of each month at 7:30 in the 
Machinery Hall tower room and all 
men interested are cordially invited to 
be present at these meetings.

RECEPTION FOR NEW FAC­
ULTY MEMBERS.
On Thursday afternoon, the first 
meeting for the year 1915-16 of the 
faculty of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology was held in the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School. Because
oi the increased registration of new 
students and the opening of several 
new courses in the school, the addi­
tion of thirty-five members was nec­
essary. The directors and deans of 
the schools made short addresses in 
which a hearty welcome was given 
and a general program of the year 
outlined. After the business of the 
afternoon had been discussed, an in­
formal reception followed. Dahlias 
were used as a centerpiece on the ta­
ble where the tea and chocolate were 
poured. It was a splendid opportunity 
for getting acquainted and all voted 
it the most successful socially ever 
given. Mrs. Elizabeth Vermocken, 
chairman of the Committee on Public 
Occasions, deserves special mention 
for the manner in which the details 
were arranged.
REGULAR STUDENT ASSEMBLY.
An assembly of all the students was 
held Monday. Miss Mary Ride, pres­
ident of the Self-government Associa­
tion, presided. For the benefit of the 
plebes parts of the constitution of the 
Association were read concerning 
membership, dues and meetings. It is 
hoped that all girls of the school will 
join, for the proceeds taken in will be 
used to send two delegates to the Na­
tional Conference of Self-government 
Associations. Because of the resigna­
tion of Miss Constance Stout from the 
vice-presidencv, it was necessary to 
elect a new officer. Miss Mary Louise 
Irwin was unanimously chosen. Miss 
Irwin is a senior, a member of the 
Delta Theta Sonority and one who is 
well fitted to take the place of the pres­
ident if her absence is necessary. It 
was also voted to have each class pres­
ident appoint a girl from her particu­
lar class to serve on a committee which 
should be responsible for an interest­
ing program for the general assembly 
to be held at least once a month. The 
rest of the time was spent in singing.
PARTY FOR THE PLEBES.
Friday afternoon in the Recreation 
Hall, the faculty advisors of the 
Plebes gave the entering class a party. 
The chief end and aim of this party 
was to get acquainted and to have a 
good time while doing so, which was 
surely achieved, for all the girls had 
a lively and interesting afternoon. The 
advisors this year for the Plebes are: 
Miss Belleville, chairman, Miss Davis, 
Miss Speer, Miss Collet, Miss Dixon, 
Miss Mason, Miss Hewitt, Miss Sibley 
and Miss Hyde.
The first thing to be done on enter­
ing the room was to pin one’s name 
on in plain view, so everyone might 
know each other by name. Dancing
was started and continued till all ar­
rived. Then the girls were divided 
into groups with their own advisor 
at their head, and competed against 
each other in many different kinds of 
races. First was the potato race, 
which was most exciting and very 
close, each group being heartily 
cheered on to victory. The bean and 
three-legged races followed, each pro­
ducing many laughs and cheers.
After a brief rest, girls were chosen 
for the cracker and water race. In 
this, two girls stood opposite each 
other, one with a hard, dry, thick 
cracker in her hand, the other with a 
glass of water and a teaspoon. The 
object was to see whether the girl 
with the cracker could eat it before 
the girl with the water succeeded in 
drinking the water one teaspoonful 
after the other. The ludicrous re­
marks of the lookers-on prevented 
any great speed records being made 
and the race went to those who could 
attend strictly to cracker or water (as 
the case might be) and ignore the au­
dience. Another race, quite exciting, 
was the so-called suit case race. Each 
girl was provided with a closed um­
brella and a suit case containing a 
skirt, a coat, a hat and a pair of gloves. 
The person who could touch the wall, 
put on the clothes, raise the umbrella, 
pick up the suit case and walk down 
the hall first, was the Avinner. The 
points won were counted together un­
der the advisors’ names. Miss Sib­
ley’s girls succeeded in acquiring the 
largest number and so to them was 
awarded the Silver Cup. Ice cream 
cones were passed and the rest of the 
time was spent in dancing. The host­
esses wish to thank those Juniors who 
helped keep score and otherwise aided 
in making the affair a success.
SOPHOMORE CLASS ELECTION.
THE GUILD.
The Guild of the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School is the only charitable 
organization in the school. Last year, 
during the first semester, about 75 
night gowns were made for the Pitts­
burgh Home for Babies, and during 
the second semester a Carnival was 
held in which over a hundred dollars 
was realized, which was given to the 
Lillian Home at Valencia. This year 
woolen socks wTill be made by the 
girls in response to a request made by 
our Major Day from Canada, where he 
is now getting recruits for the army, 
after which he expects to lead them 
to the front. Mr. Day was Professor 
of English in our school last year and 
as a special request asked in his letter 
that each girl contribute a pair of 
woolen socks for his soldiers. The 
Guild also expects to have a dance, 
the proceeds of which will be used for 
charity. If for no other reason than 
the good it will do someone else, aside 
from the pleasure the giver will derive 
from it, it behooves every girl in the 
school to join the Guild. Everyone 
knows there are different types of 
girls, some may be dramatically in­
clined, other athletically, etc., but all 
girls have somewhere in their hearts 
the desire to help others less fortunate 
than themselves, and it is to those 
girls we make the plea, “Join the 
Guild.”
This seems to be the popular time 
for holding elections and so the 
Sophomore class fell in line and held 
theirs last Wednesday. The following 
girls were elected to office: President, 
Mi ss Janet Mandell; Vice President, 
Miss Helen Senn; Secretary, Miss 
Grace Crawford; Treasurer, Miss Ida 
Richter; and Class Representative, 
Miss Bearnice Thompson. Having 
left behind forever the frivolities of 
their Plebe year, the Sophomores 
could have no better leader than Miss 
Mandell. in the absoibing business of 
learning how to become successful 
Juniors. Althoug'h a hard worker in 
the Athletic Association, and a mem­
ber of the M. M. C.,S. basketball team 
yet all the girls feel the new president 
will find time to attend to her class 
duties in an efficient manner.
JUNIOR CLASS ELECTION.
Last Thursday the Junior class held 
its election of officers for the coming 
year. The following girls were elect­
ed: President, Miss Margaret Worth; 
Vice President, Miss Sue Smith; Sec­
retary, Miss Agnes Wright; Treas­
urer, Miss Isabel Smith; and Social 
Chairman, Miss Regina Jacobs. The 
class is to be congratulated upon the 
splendid judgment it showed in select­
ing these girls. Many problems will 
have to be solved, not the least by any 
means, being, the Junior Prom, an 
event looked forward to with great 
eagerness by the two upper classes. 
Especially in the choice of a presi­
dent was the Junior class fortunate, 
for Miss Worth is an able girl, not 
only willing to work herself, but also 
possessing the valuable faculty of 
making others help her.
SENIOR CLASS ELECTION.
The Senior class held its election of 
officers last Friday. As a result, the 
following girls were elected: Presi­
dent, Miss Grace Searight; Vice Presi­
dent, Miss Golda McClelland; Secre- 
tary-Treasurer, Miss Katherine Haag; 
Social Chairman, Miss Lila Gilmore. 
The Senior class can consider itself 
fortunate in being able to retain for 
two years the same president, for Miss 
Searight served the class in the same 
capacity last year. Through all the 
trials and troubles of the Junior year 
of college, the class of 1916 was safe­
ly taken and came this far in their 
history with the desire for the same 
leader. The president is a very cap­
able girl, and one who will, with the 
aid of the class, do her best to make 
this last year at Tech the most suc­
cessful in its history.

INDUSTRY NOTES.
At a meeting of the middle class it 
was decided after a discussion that 
students from the other schools en­
tering the Industry Plebe class would 
not be required to wear the regulation 
hat. This rule was deemed only fair 
inasmuch as the hat had already been 
worn by these students when Plebes 
in their former school. A committee 
was appointed to confer with the 
classes of the other schools in order 
to obtain a general ruling to this ef­
fect. However, the result of this ac­
tion on the part of the other schools 
will in no way affect the policy of the 
middlemen.
Contributions will soon be asked 
from each member of the Plebe class 
towards the upkeep of the club room. 
It is the regular policy that each in­
coming class showld contribute 
towards the maintenance of this room. 
Due to the new location, various new 
articles of furniture will be necessary.
NATIONAL SECURITY SPEAKER 
ADDRESSES STUDENT 
ASSEMBLY.
At the first meeting of the Assem­
bly, School of Applied Industries, on 
Wednesday, September 22nd, Mr. 
Frederick H. Chase, of New York, re­
lated to the students some very inter­
esting experiences, which he encoun­
tered a few years ago in the gold 
mines of Alaska where he spent con­
siderable time as a practical miner.
Mr. Chase is at present the Field 
Secretary of The National Security 
League of New York, whose slogan 
is, “In time of peace prepare for war.” 
He is visiting the larger cities of our 
country for the purpose of organizing 
chapters of this League, thereby hop­
ing to inspire the people toward the 
building up and maintenance of a 
more substantial national defense and 
at the same time be intends visiting 
the various colleges throughout the 
country, placing the purpose of The 
National Security League before the 
men of these colleges.

TECH BAND DESERVES CREDIT
Continued from Page 1 
to the efforts of the band. This was 
most evident even last Saturday at 
the first game of the season.
It has been proposed that the ex­
penses of the band be paid to Cleve­
land at the time of the Case game. It 
would seem that this would be a prop­
osition deserving of the efforts of the 
entire student body and ^especially 
those under whose jurisdiction such 
a plan would come. Not only would 
this be a great advertisement for 
Tech at Cleveland, but it would do 
much to create that most desirable 
quality—Tech spirit. Incidentally it 
is not to be overlooked that such a 
trip would, in a measure, be a recom­
pense to the members of the band 
for their untiring efforts during the 
season.
The band is under the able leader­
ship of Director Sullivan, and the 
management consists of the following 
officers: A. J. Hanks ’18, manager;
O. C. Brenot ’19, secretary; C. A. An­
drews ’18, librarian.
A partial list of the members of. the 
band at present is as follows: C. A.
Andrews, Pic.; O. U. Brady, Corn.; 
O. C. Brenot, Alto; C. C. Britsch, Bar.;
B. Boccie, Clar.; C. H. Gross, Clar.;
A. Feirnen, Cor. 2; A. L. Hank?, 
Clar.; C. F. Hines, Valve F.; R. C. 
Lear, Clar.; E. H. Loeff, Cor.; \V. 
Loh, Clar.; Geo. Mayer, Corn.; M. E. 
Molner, Tenor; H. B. McMillan, Cor.;
F.. V. Smith, Cor.; G. C. Smith, Cor.; 
T. C. Weidert, Clar.; C. F. Sheakley, 
Cor.; M. V. Reed, Trornb.; F. W. 
Hammil, Cor.; Ed. Kinney, Cor.; L. B. 
Christman, Flute; Vannan, Cor.; Gill, 
Clar.; P. R. Wuking, Clar.; Golden- 
sen, Cor.; Smith, Cor.; S. A. Smith,

B flat Kass; Huyeth McKean, Clar.;
O. M. Olsen, Slide; Headdings, Bass 
drum; Dclavan, Snare; Porter, Snare; 
Olmsted, Clar.
Only six of last year’s men have 
not returned and about twenty new 
applications have been made. The 
management requests that all men 
who can play any sort of an instru­
ment report at the next meeting, a 
special need is felt for two men to 
play E flat base horns. These instru­
ments will be. furnished.
We must have 500 
students in Cleveland, 
Nov. 7th.
GRADUATE MANAGER ELECTED
Continued from Page 1
had in 1908 and made an excellent and 
untiring manager. He is now district 
manager for the Pittsburgh Testing 
Laboratories at Dallas, Texas.
Three names have been suggested 
for the full time position, all being 
prominent workers in the Alumni As­
sociation. They are, Bill Miller, ’14, 
Senior president and track manager 
when in school; Boots, ’12, also Senior 
President and track captain; and Al­
lan Bright, ’11, of football fame. The 
main difficulty in securing any of these 
men would be that each has at present 
a very good job of his own.
Burt Colmery, ’08, and Guy Hal- 
ferty, ’08, have both been mentioned 
for the part time position if this is de­
cided on. The former at present is 
an instructor in this institution and 
Guy is a member of a local contracting 
firm. Both are ardent Alumni and 
athletic enthusiasts.
Meanwhile, Director of Athletics 
McCulloch has taken the burden upon 
his shoulders and is directing the var­
ious financial matters and the make­
up of the schedules. The various 
questions pertaining to football in the 
way of policy, equipment and expenses 
and the make-up of the basketball, 
track and baseball schedules all come 
up at this time and cause enough work 
to well fill up his time without con­
sidering the many other affairs which 
by virtue of his position require at­
tention. Mr. McCulloch will call a 
meeting of the board at the earliest 
possible time in order to settle the 
difficulty.
PAN-HELLENIC.
Pan-Hellenic is a society composed 
of two representatives from each of 
the six sororities—Alpha Delta, Delta 
Delta, Delta Theta, Theta Sigma, Al­
pha Psi, and Alpha Sigma Pi—which 
are the only ones recognized by the 
school. The purpose is to govern 
rushing rules which at present limit 
the time to the second semester of 
the first year. However, it is being 
considered waiting till the beginning 
of the Sophomore year. The repre­
sentatives are: Ruth Pontius, Gladys 
Wakefield, Katherin Haag, Marjorie 
Carmichael, Golda McClelland, Flor­
ence Burgham, Ruth Keiser, Margaret 
Wirth, Lila Gilmore, Imelda Chitten- 
don, Hazel Thomas, Regina Jacobs.

Industry School and also night elec­
trician for the buildings. The motor­

some eighty feet. Mr. Orbin suffered 
a badly bruised leg and Walker was 
removed to the hospital unconscious, 
with serious injuries about the head 
and body. The latter is however do­
ing very well now and will probably 
be around again by Sunday.

The Class A. charette which finished 
on Saturday proved a most difficult 
charette as well as a most interesting 
one. Few problems were in evidence 
as the esquisse was given out in the 
middle of the summer, “Pink” Spigel 
being the only one to take the Class 
A Archeology which consisted of the 
Plan and Elevation of a Roman Pleas­
ure Gallery of about the time of Au­
gustus I.
The Plebe class held temporary 
elections this last week, electing Wil­
loughby as temporary president. They 
have already formed a committee 
which is at work on the Annual De­
sign Plebe Smoker to be given by the 
Plebes to all upper classmen.
Edward F. Kelly, of last year’s foot­
ball team, is back at work in the draft­
ing room again and is out on the foot­
ball field every night. Another De­
sign man to be on the team this year.
McCaughey, last year’s football 
captain, reported for practice on 
Thursday night. Here is hoping that 
he stays out.
It might be said that “Red” Trent 
is just as noisy as he was last year.
The Sophomore class elections were 
held with the following results: Ed­
win Green, president; Robert Orr, vice 
president; Sarah Allewelt, second vice 
president; Harry Bremmer, secrtary; 
Oliver Wilkins, treasurer. We under­
stand that the policy that this class 
will follow will be slightly different 
than that of the past. Plebe regula­
tions are to be strictly enforced, and 
Plebes are supposed to show due re­
spect to all upper classmen, but differ­
ing from last year, there will be no 
unnecessary horse play unless some 
Plebe’s head gets entirely too big for 
the school. We can say that we 
heartily endorse this policy, and al­
though a Plebe is nothing, we believe 
in giving him a chance to prove him­
self a man by the time Moving-up Day 
arrives.
The esquisse-esquisse held in the 
Lodge on Friday afternoon proved to 
be a most interesting problem, being 
a “Pool in a Garden.” Most of the 
men participated in taking it, and 
some very fine sketches were in evi­
dence.
Who said that “Calculus” was easy? 
Bring forth the man so that the Soph­
omore class may pay him their usual 
respects.
It may be of interest to some read­
ers to make them acquainted with the 
fact that M. C. Adams holds the very 
honorable position in the Design 
School as Keeper of the Royal Shears.
There have been many inquiries of 
late as to if William will ever become 
sedate. We pass our judgment. Nega­
tive side wins.
Did you notice Greulich’s eye? It 
must have been an awful fight. Won­
der what the other fellow looks like,
Have you seen the new Fall Display 
of Infant Moustaches? It’s worth 
your while. Notice, then!
DESIGN SCHOOL MEETING 
TODAY.
Design School meeting will be held 
this afternoon at 3:30 sharp in the 
large exhibition hall. Introduction of 
business pertaining to the Mediaeval
Ball to be given in this school either 
the middle of November or February. 
Establishment of a Financial Board 
to be discussed and voted upon. Elec­
tion of officers of the School of Ap­
plied Design for this semester will 
take place also. Other important busi­
ness. Everyone urged to be present.
GENERAL LECTURES 
IN DESIGN SCHOOL.
It has been so arranged that all de­
partments have the 11:30 hour Friday 
open for a general lecture. Such a 
movement is due to Mr. Hornbostel. 
Arrangements are to be made to have 
various speakers on the allied arts at 
times. The idea seems to be, at the 
bottom, to create imagination and 
spirit in our school.
Henry Hornbostel stated in brief 
that the Design School is at present 
the only place in this universe where 
the allied arts, music, drama, painting, 
architecture, and sculpture are housed 
in one building, being one big family. 
It has the envy of all schools in that 
respect. “Our new house has been 
designed especially for jolification.” 
“We have been criticized with a won­
derful result, lending a reputation 
abroad.”
He advised the new students to get 
into the atmosphere of the surround­
ings, urged the hearty co-operation of 
all departments. “With the present 
faculty, which is claimed to be a most 
democratic one, we are to be congrat­
ulated.”
“The new building is near its com­
pletion and plans to handle the on­
coming students is a problem. Either 
expansion or elimination must take 
place. The department of sculpture 
is to enlarge and inaugurate an indus­
trial branch in sculpturing and model­
ing.”
Note:—It would be an excellent idea 
if every student of the Design School 
would turn out for this “General Lec­
ture.” One hour a week is not much 
and you will derive great benefit.
NOTICE.
Our critic of drama and music will 
prepare a number of criticisms for an 
early issue. Watch for them. Let the 
editor know how you like them. Cor­
rect us if we make any mistakes.
SENIOR CLASS ELECTIONS.
At a meeting Thursday afternoon 
the Senior class of Design School

man president; Carl C. Britsch was 
elected vice president; H. B. Pearce,

SCIENCE MEN WIN HONORS.
Awards Made In Engineers’ Society 
Competition.
SIGMA RHO WINS SCHOLASTIC 
CUP.
Announcement was made during the 
summer of the award of the Inter-Fra­
ternity Scholarship Cup to Sigma Rho. 
This prize is a beautiful silver loving 
cup standing some twenty-four inches 
high. It was donated by members of 
the Science faculty and others inter­
ested in the fraternities to be award­
ed each year to that organization 
which maintains for the year the 
highest scholastic standing in the 
School of Applied Science. Any fra­
ternity winning the cup three out of 
four consecutive years will obtain per­
manent possession of the trophy.
The standing for the past year was 
as follows:
Sigma Rho .................................... 79.2
Beta Theta Epsilon .................... 78.6
Sigma Tau...................................... 76.7
Zeta Lambda Epsilon................ 61.8
Theta Xi ........................................ 58.8
Xi Sigma Upsilon ...................... 58.9
Woodlawn Club .......................... 44.9
As a result of the annual competi­
tion of the Engineers’ Society of 
Western Pennsylvania, which was 
held during the last school year, eight 
men from the Science School re­
ceived awards for the best solution of 
given engineering problems. Eight 
awards out of twenty-one gives Car­
negie Tech an average of thirty-eight 
per cent, which is indeed an accom­
plishment to be proud of. Not only 
that but the awards were first, second, 
and third in Mechanical and Electrical 
Engineering. Henry Levy, ’15, came 
first in Electrical Engineering, with 
L. K. Wildberg and H. E. Gumbart, 
both of 1915, second and third, re­
spectively. In Mechanical Engineer­
ing A. R. Brock, ’15, received first 
award, with W. N. Espey, ’16, second 
and D. C. Christianson, ’16, third. W.
B. Hamilton, ’15, received third award 
in Civil Engineering and E. W. Kram- 
pert, ’15, was given honorable men­
tion.
This year’s problems have already 
been given out, thus allowing the stu­
dent a whole school year to work on 
them. In Hydraulic and Sanitary En­
gineering the competitors are expect­
ed to install a system for supplying 
water to a rapidly growing town of 
eight thousand people. The Civil En­
gineers are to submit designs and 
prices for the construction of a new 
mill building. The building is to be 
covered with galvanized corrugated 
steel with three lines of windows and 
is to be provided with a runway for a 
forty-ton crane.
Right here it might not be out of 
the way to add a few interesting facts 
about the Engineers' Society. At 
present it is in its thirty-sixth year 
and has an enrollment of between 
eleven and twelve hundred members. 
Discussions are held at various times 
on engineering papers and probelms 
presented by prominent engineers 
from all over the country. Medals 
are awarded to members who intro­
duce papers of unusual worth. In ad­
dition, smokers are held by which the 
members are able to get together 
socially.
SCHOLARSHIPS.
At the present time the money is on 
hand for the scholarships presented 
to the school by the classes of 1914 
and 1915. In addition a member of 
last year’s class has generously pre­
sented a scholarship. Such a gift is 
indeed worthy of praise as it shows an 
exceptional loyalty of the donor and 
his great interest in the welfare of 
Carnegie Tech students.
All of these scholarships will be 
awarded in the General Lecture which 
comes one week before the Christmas 
holidays.
Another project, hitherto untried, is 
being given serious consideration. A 
project which will further inspire a 
high standard in scholarship. That is 
the forming of an honorary society. 
The society would include a man from 
each of the following engineering 
groups:
Chemical Engineering 
Metallurgical and Mining combined 
Civil and Sanitary Engineering com­
bined
Commercial Engineering 
Electrical Engineering 
Mechanical Engineering 
This society will be the nucleus of 
a chapter of a national honorary fra­
ternity.
AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF 
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS.
At the last regular meeting of the 
C. I. T. student branch of the Ameri­
can Institute of Electrical Engineers 
on June 9, 1915, the following officers 
for 1915-16 were chosen:
Chairman, D. L. Trautman.
Secretary, H. F. Gibson.
Treasurer, L. E. Schiffman.
Executive Committee: Prof. Denni­
son, A. M. Stevenson, R. Selquist.
Complete arrangements have been 
made for the establishment of the 
branch and all the Electricals should 
make an effort to become student 
members of the Institute so that we 
may have a strong organization.
NATIONAL FRATERNITY MEN 
TO MEET.
There will be a meeting of all na­
tional fraternity now at Tech at the 
Woodlawn Club next Friday night at 
eight o’clock. There has been a long 
felt need for some organization of 
stray Greeks at Tech for several years 
and :t is with this idea that through 
the iourtesy of E. Baker, of the 
Woodlawn Club, a meeting has been 
arranged for at the end of this week. 
There ai° a great many national fra­
ternity m6n here who are members of 
Delta Kappa Epsilon, Sigma Rho, Phi 
Gamma Delia, Sigma Xi, Phi Delta

only the idea of bringing together the 
students at Tech, but it is also hoped 
that members of the faculty who are 
members of national fraternities will 
be present at this meeting. Plans will 
be proposed to form a Pan-Hellenic 
organization with the idea of, at least 
in a measure, supplying the stray 
Greek with some common interest 
which will make his stay at Tech a 
more pleasant one. All members of 
national fraternities are strongly 
urged and courteously invited to at­
tend this meeting.
GLEE CLUB TRYOUT.
The first tryout for the Glee and 
Mandolin Clubs was held in Sunday 
afternoon in Room 104, A. I., at 1:30. 
Owing to the wet weather only a few 
of the old men turned out. Spencer, 
Weber, Einstein, Tiffany, Newman, 
Schütz, McNulty, Vierheller and Pan- 
nabaker were there, however, and 
more of the old men promise to be on 
hand at the next meeting.
Fifty new men tried out for posi­
tions. From this squad of promising 
material vacancies in the Club will be 
easily filled.
Very few of the old men in the 
Mandolin Club were out. There was 
some very promising talent among 
the new men which assures us of a 
first class club.
Under President Shutz, new pol­
icy all of the meetings must begin on 
time as a five-minute tardiness counts 
an absence against a man in getting 
his insignia.
Fifteen new men are needed in each 
club and from this wealth of material 
both organizations should have a very 
successful year.
The last year’s insignia were given 
to the old members by Publicity Man­
ager Newman.
Regular rehearsals start next Sun­
day at sharp 2 o’clock for the Glee 
Club and 3 o’clock for the Mandolin 
Club. Be there at 1:45 and get ac­
quainted with your clubmate.

The New England Club will hold 
their first smoker of the year at the

thing for a quarterback to remember. 
Altdorfer did some beautiful punting, 
his first punt being close to sixty 
yards and the others following close­
ly. The real “football” of these men 
will undoubtedly result in many vic­
tories for “Tech” and the glory and 
standing that is the sure result of 
clean and sportsmanlike and victor­
ious play.
The biggest disappointment of the 
game was the absence of “Sonny” 
Kesner, our star quarterbeck. “Sonny” 
is a little back in something, some­
where, but we have hopes of his re­
covery before the next onslaught. 
Should he be unable to return to the 
game a huge problem will confront 
Coach Steffens to develop a man that 
will even approximate the work of the 
“Little General.” McSorley, who 
played on Saturday, deserves credit 
for jumping into the position on short 
notice and preparation. His chief 
fault is the lack of training for this 
position and experience in its execu­
tion, which fault can only be reme­
died by applying large doses of the 
above and giving them time to work. 
He has lots of snap and the necessary 
physical qualities but lacks the gen­
eralship at present that he gives prom­
ise of developing with more experi­
ence.
The weather conditions were most 
favorable to the spectators but a little 
too warm for the men in the game, 
which may be somewhat responsible 
for the lack of interesting attack and 
game defense.
Little of interest occurred in the 
first quarter, the ball being mostly in 
Thiel’s territory and only once dan­
gerously so, but a penalty of fifteen 
yards against Tech soon removed the 
danger. The kicking of Altdorfer and 
his all-around work, although he was 
seemingly neglected by the quarter, 
came up to the highest expectations 
of the Tech supporters and causes us 
all to tend him a rousing welcome and 
wish him the best of fortune. Finley 
also showed his calber by his clever 
running and brilliant interference. We 
know Marshal and were pleased to 
see him even improved from last year 
and right in the game. Nothing went 
past Lauer and the only weakness ap­
peared to be in the line, which we are 
glad to say bolstered up at critical 
times.
The second quarter opened with 
more spirit and after an incompleted 
forward pass by Thiel and a kick to 
Finley Tech started down the field, 
using old close formations and a de­
layed pass, making three first downs 
and bringing the ball to Thiel’s thir­
teen yard line, where Finley fought 
his way for the remaining distance 
through left tackle to the first touch­
down of the game. Altdorfer punted 
out to Finley as the ball was too 
far to the side and failed to kick goal. 
The score is now six to nothing in our 
favor and it begins to look like an 
interesting game.
Altdorfer kicked off to Thie1 and the 
game was resumed on their ten-yard 
mark. Kishler, for the visitors, made 
first down in two off-tackle plays pre­
ceded by a little shift that proved
troublesome to the Techites. Two in­
completed forward passes and a fif­
teen-yard penalty against the visitors 
put them back to their five-yard line, 
where Snyder called for a punt. Here 
the line began to assume life and as 
soon as the ball had been passed three 
Tech men were through and bearing 
down on Patterson, who was trying to 
get the ball away as quickly as pos­
sible, but Fletcher was “ in his way” 
and the kick was blocked. The pig­
skin evaded the first several attempts 
at capture but was finally covered by 
big McFeaters and a touchdown 
checked off to his credit. Altdorfer 
failed at goal and the score stood at 
twelve to nothing as the first half 
ended.
In the intermission the old Tech 
spirit was in evidence as the loyal 
students jumped out on the field and 
formed the big “C” and sent the 
echoes of their spirited yells resound­
ing out through East Liberty. This 
spirit, especially of the lower class­
men, with the excellent promise of the 
warriors, makes us certain that this is 
going to be the best season of football 
this this institution has ever known. 
Much of this credit goes to the best 
coach we have ever known—Walter 
Steffens—a gentleman, a sportsman, 
and a man through and through. All 
we’ve got to do is to help Mr. Stef­
fens as much as we can and then keep 
on helping him some more by appre­
ciating his work and that of the team, 
and what they both are doing for the 
school.
The third tally was registered in the 
third quarter by Marshal, who inter­
cepted a forward pass and dodged his 
way over the line after the line had 
been in greater danger on two pre­
vious occasions, but was saved, once 
by a fifteen-yard penalty against Tech 
and then by an incompleted forward 
pass that fell over the enemy’s line. 
The offense showed decided strength 
and gains wTere easily made but some­
thing chanced at the critical moment 
that deferred the scoring. Altdorfer 
failed again at goal, and the score was 
eighteen to nothing.
The last touchdown was made with 
but two minutes to play in the last 
quarter. With the ball on Thiel’s five- 
yard line Lynch again attempted to 
punt and the same thing occurred that 
gained the second touchdown for the 
home team. McFeaters again recov­
ered a blocked kick and was credited 
with a second touchdown. Altdorfer 
kicked out to Finley on the fifteen- 
yard line and then kicked the season’s 
first goal, making the score twenty- 
five to nothing, making Tech the vic­
tor in the initial game of the season 
and the initial engagement with Thiel.
For Thiel, Callahan, Lynch, Kishler 
and Trumpeter made things interest­
ing by clever running and defensive 
work. For Tech we will mention Alt­
dorfer, Finley, Marshal, Lauer and 
Hellstrom, all of whom played “foot­
ball.” Line-up:

COLLEGE MILITARY 
TRAINING.
Many of the alumni of Johns Hop­
kins Universitay favor the introduc­
tion of a course of military instruc­
tion as a part of the regular work of 
the institution. It is not proposed 
that this shall mitigate in any way 
the warlike game of football or the 
somewhat gentler rigors of baseball. 
These games might be called almost 
a preparatory course for fine preci­
sion of military evolutions and disci­
pline, though the footballists would 
doubtless argue that they spring full 
panoplied from the brow of Mars, and 
that if called on at any time to fight 
they would promptly send a flying 
wedge through the enemy’s lines.
A fraction of the alumni, however, 
is opposed to this innovation of belli­
cose training, as it might invite a di­
version from more important and vio­
lent assaults on Virgil and Cicero and 
the differential calculus; but what are 
those effete provocatives of mental ac­
tivity compared to the modern mili­
tary drill, evolutions to the music of 
the spirit-stirring drum and ear pierc­
ing fife, with a possibility of gaining 
undying glory at the mouth of a 75- 
centimeter cannon amid the enliven­
ing patter of shrapnel?
Yet why should the lofty alumni 
have anything to say about the mat­
ter? They are practically out of the 
running. They are for the most part 
on the retired list, their laurels green 
or more or less faded. They are the 
carpet knights of the annual banquet. 
At least once a year they play the 
gourmet, are connoisseurs of sauterne 
and champagne, canvas-back and ter­
rapin, soups, entrees, ragouts, des-

serts, with speeches galore before and 
during the cigarets and coffee. Why 
should not the alumni go into military 
training rather than force it upon the 
poor freshies and sophs, the tender 
juniors and the tough seniors of the 
passing day?
“The world has room for the manly 
man, with the spirit of manly cheer; 
The world delights in the man who 
smiles when his eyes keep back the 
tear;
It loves the man, who, when things go 
wrong, can take his place and stand 
With his face to the fight and his eyes 
to the light, and toil with a willing 
hand.
The manly man is the country’s need, 
and the moment’s need, forsooth, 
With a heart that bears to the pulsing 
tread of the lilied leagues of truth; 
The world is his and it waits for him, 
and it leaps to hear the ring 
Of the blow he strikes and the wheels 
he turns and the hammer he dares 
to swing;
It likes the forward look in his face, 
the poise of his noble head,
And the onward lunge of his tireless 
will and the sweep of his dauntless 
tread!
Hurrah for the manly man who comes 
wth sunlight on his face,
And the strength to do and the will to 
dare and the courage to find his 
place!
The world delights in the manly man, 
and the weak and evil flee,
When the manly man goes forth to 
hold his own on land and sea.”
