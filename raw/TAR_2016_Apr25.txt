This summer, Carnegie 
Mellon will of?cially say 
goodbye to TartanTRAK and 
hello to Handshake, a new job 
recruitment website that will 
connect students with poten-
tial employers and the Career 
and Professional Develop-
ment Center (CPDC) staff. 
TartanTRAK has been used by 
the University for many years 
now, and, although it is famil-
iar, the CPDC decided to make 
the change in order to provide 
a better service. Although 
the possibilities presented to 
students through this new 
system have created a buzz of 
excitement, the of?cial transi-
tion will not take place until 
June 1. To understand the 
impact that this change will 
have on the ease of access of 
job recruitment and how to 
prepare for the transition, The 
Tartan spoke with Diane Tay-
lor, Assistant Director/Career 
Consultant for Dietrich Col-
lege, and Marissa Fenwick, 
Assistant Director/Career 
Consultant for the College of 
Engineering at the CPDC.
Handshake is a 21st 
century tool that was de-
signed by students who know 
?rst-hand the struggles of 
the job recruitment process. 
The website aligns with the 
media platforms students are 
accustomed to today, thus 
providing easier access. “CMU 
students are going to ?nd it 
more intuitive to use, easier 
to connect with what they are 
looking for, and enjoy a better 
user experience all around,” 
Fenwick said. Fenwick 
believes that the intuitive-
ness of the website combined 
with its ease of use will give 
students better access to job 
and internship opportunities, 
career events, and programs 
and services offered by the 
CPDC that better re?ect what 
students seek.
Part of Handshake’s 
intuitive use comes from its 
similarity to Facebook, with 
a direct focus on job recruit-
ment. Taylor noted that, when 
users log on to the website, 
they are taken to a news feed, 
similar to Facebook, with 
updates on job and intern-
ship opportunities posted by 
employers.
Students are used to fum-
bling through the search for 
job opportunities on Tartan-
TRAK. On Handshake, howev-
er, job and internship postings 
from potential employers are 
directly presented to students 
on their news feed. Rather 
than seeking out employment 
opportunities one by one, stu-
dents can “follow” employers 
in order to receive updates on 
job postings. Students will be 
able to customize their Hand-
shake accounts to accom-
modate what best ?ts their 
interests.
Taylor pointed out that one 
unique feature of Handshake 
is the ability to customize how 
you receive noti?cations, such 
as text messages, emails, or 
noti?cations on the website.

For the ?rst time ever, the 
Western Pennsylvania Special 
Olympics Spring Sectional will 
come to Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity this Saturday, April 30. 
The event comes at an oppor-
tune time for Carnegie Mellon 
students to de-stress after the 
last day of classes and cheer 
on young adults with intel-
lectual disabilities from across 
the country as they compete 
in basketball, swimming, track 
and ?eld, tennis, golf, and 
more.
In preparation for Satur-
day’s games, The Tartan spoke 
to representatives and athletes 
that will take part in the event 
about the role they played in 
bringing it to Carnegie Mel-
lon and what they are most 
looking forward to.
The Western Pennsylvania 
Special Olympics has his-
torically been held at Clarion 
University, just outside the 
Pittsburgh area. This year, 
however, Special Olympics 
Pennsylvania (SOPA) was on 
the lookout for a new venue for 
the Spring Games. This caught 
the attention of Carnegie Mel-
lon Police Lieutenant Joseph 
Meyers.
Lieutenant Meyers saw this 
as the perfect opportunity for 
SOPA to partner with Carnegie 
Mellon to take this event to a 
new level. “It [gives] SOPA an 
opportunity to bring the event 
to a world class university in 
the heart of Pittsburgh, and 
an opportunity for the CMU 
community (particularly the 
students) to engage with the 
athletes on a personal level, 
and experience ?rst-hand 
the dedication, commitment, 
and sacri?ce of each special 
Olympian — not only to their 
sport, but to their daily strug-
gle for acceptance and inclu-
sion in mainstream society,” 
Lieutenant Meyers said. This 
Carnegie Mellon anticipates the arrivalof the Pennsylvania Special Olympics TartanTRAK to be replaced on June 1

The Sherman and Joyce 
Bowie Scott Hall is the most 
recent addition to the Carn-
egie Mellon campus. The new 
home for the Biomedical En-
gineering Department, Nano 
Fabrication, and Wilton E. 
Scott Institute for Energy In-
novation, set to of?cially open 
on April 30, is by far one of 
the most uniquely designed 
buildings on campus. Nestled 
in the area between Wean 
and Hamerschlag Halls, Scott 
Hall’s glass exterior stands 
out amongst the concrete and 
brick architecture of its neigh-
boring buildings. This building 
serves as a hub for the College 
of Engineering, while also pro-
viding connections between 
integral areas of campus.
One of the main goals of 
Scott Hall is to foster a sense 
of collaboration. “Scott Hall 
?ts like a jigsaw piece into 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus and 
was designed with the univer-
sity’s culture of collaboration 
and sustainability in mind,” 
College of Engineering Dean, 
James Garrett Jr. said. Scott 
Hall consists of two main spac-
es, the North Wing and the 
John Bertucci Nanotechnol-
ogy Laboratory. These spaces 
are connected by the Arthur 
C. Ruge Atrium, which will 
house a café area, and the Col-
laboratory, “a four-story space 
that connects the levels of the 
North Wing of the building,” 
according to Garrett. The Col-
laboratory “connects all four 
?oors of the building [and] it 
has this big beautiful [stair-
case] in it that sort of brings 
people into the building and 
allows them to move between 
?oors,” said Isaac Campbell, 
principal of OFFICE 52 Archi-
tecture. Campbell described 
the space as a “vertical mixer 
for the different disciplines of 
the building.” Campbell also 
explained that true collabora-
tion is not just about sharing 
a building with another dis-
cipline. “[A] lot of the magic 
happens in the social activity,” 
he said. “You run into some-
one in line getting a sandwich 
and then you get talking about 
something and then pretty 
soon you realize that even 
though your work is very differ-
ent, you’re actually working on 
the same thing from different 
perspectives and then next 
thing you know, you’re writing 
a grant proposal.”
There was also a lot of 
thought put into the design 
choices that went into making 
Scott Hall an elevated, four-
story building rather than a 
seven-story building that be-
gan at the base of Junction Hol-
low. “The North Wing is a mul-
ticolored glass structure that 
sits elegantly over Junction 
Hollow on a sculptural compo-
sition of angled white steel col-
umns, which are strategically 
placed in the overall design to 
avoid the utilities below,” Gar-
rett said. Campbell elaborated 
on this, noting that beginning 
the building at the base of 
Junction Hollow “was going 
to force us to be much closer 
to the railroad tracks, which 
was going to be a big problem 
for the labs. By putting the 
building up on the columns we 
were able to leave the utilities 
in the hillside which saved a 
ton of money.” Campbell also 
explained that they “were able 
to take the most sensitive labs 
and were able to put them in 
the courtyard” underneath the 
grassy area in order to “make 
those labs more functional.” 
This idea also opened up the 
area to the rest of campus 
instead of being cut off by 
shrubbery. He explained how 
the courtyard area really made 
the campus feel more opened 
up and connected all the way 
back past the mall and into the 
College of Fine Arts lawn.
Campbell also explained 
the reasoning behind the num-
bering of the ?oors in Scott 
Hall. “The ?oor levels in the 
building had to be staggered 
because of height restric-
tions,” he said. In order for 
the building to be able to con-
nect to Wean Hall on one side 
and Hamerschlag Hall on the 
other side, the ?oors needed 
to be slightly offset. This con-
nectivity also goes to further 
strengthen the idea of bridging 
the gap that existed between 
some of the buildings on cam-
pus. Aside from connecting the 
buildings, Scott Hall also con-
nects people simply by being 
on campus. Campbell said he 
understands that “the univer-
sity is squeezed for space and 
the campus is kind of boxed in 
and has actively been work-
ing to ?nd areas where it can 
grow.” This lack of space has 
forced expansion into Craig 
Street and across Forbes Av-
enue because there isn’t much 
space left on campus to de-
velop. By keeping Scott Hall 
on campus, despite space 
constraints, Campbell was 
able to foster connectivity and 
make accessing Baker Hall and 
Scaife Hall much easier.
Scott Hall is also an inno-
vative hub designed to foster 
interdisciplinary research. 
“The new space enriches the 
campus fabric and strength-
ens connectivity by linking 
four major buildings: Ham-
erschlag, Porter, Roberts and 
Wean Halls,” said Campbell. 
“[It] very much ?ts in with the 
collaborative and interdisci-
plinary culture at the univer-
sity.” Between the open North 
Wing and the Collaboratory, it 
is clear that Scott Hall was de-
signed with the collaborative 
nature of the university in 
mind.
The café will be open for 
business on Wednesday April 
27, and Campus Design and 
Facility Development expect 
the Nano Fabrication facility 
to be operational by fall 2016. 
The campus-wide celebration 
for the opening of the Sher-
man and Joyce Bowie Scott 
Hall will take place in the 
building on Saturday, April 30 
at 11 a.m.

the founding head of the 
Machine Learning Depart-
ment. His research focuses 
on learning algorithms, with 
particular interest in ana-
lyzing MRIs to model brain 
cognition.
In addition to his new 
membership in the AAAS, 
he has also been elected 
fellow of the American 
Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, and served 
for two years as President 
of the Association for the 
Advancement of Arti?cial 
Intelligence.

Student Senate starts CMU Speaks to bring awareness to mental health issues
On Thursday April 21, 
volunteers from Active 
Minds and Senate gathered 
on The Cut from 10 a.m. to 
4 p.m. to read stories about 
student mental health aloud.
The event was the result 
of an initiative from Senate’s 
Academic Affairs Committee 
called CMU Speaks.
In late February, the Aca-
demic Affairs Committee 
hosted Pulse Check: Senate 
Mental Health Week. Mem-
bers tabled in the Merson 
Courtyard each day to raise 
mental health awareness and 
facilitate discussion among 
students. They also hung 
posters around campus ad-
vertising the opportunity to 
anonymously submit person-
al stories about mental health 
at Carnegie Mellon. Senate 
received 41 responses.
The authors of these 
stories granted their permis-
sion to have them published 
on the CMU Speaks website 
(https://cmuspeaks.word-
press.com/) and read aloud 
at the event. Since Thursday, 
the website has received over 
1,000 pageviews.
The CMU Speaks initiative 
is ongoing, and Senate Aca-
demic Affairs (AA) Commit-
tee Chairman Eric Zhu says 
that Active Minds and AA in-
tend to make this an annual 
event. Students can con-
tinue to submit their stories 
to CMU Speaks at https://

goal of acceptance, Meyers 
notes, has not yet been fully 
achieved, but he hopes that 
support from the Carnegie 
Mellon community for the ath-
letes in Saturday’s event will 
bring them one step closer.
Meyers took the reins on 
this project, and procured 
critical support from univer-
sity entities. He reached out 
to Vice President of Campus 
Affairs Michael Murphy, who 
enthusiastically backed the 
project, telling him to “make it 
happen.” Also on board were 
Beth Yazemboski and Monica 
Galmarini from Conferences 
and Event Services and Direc-
tor of Athletics Josh Centor. 
“The effort continues to grow, 
and we’re expecting a great 
event that will become a last-
ing part of the CMU and Spe-
cial Olympics experiences,” 
Meyers said.
In order to raise money 
and awareness for the Spe-
cial Olympics, Meyers, and 
hundreds of other LETR of-
?cers, participated in SOPA’s 
fundraising events including 
the annual Pittsburgh Polar 
Plunge and the Law Enforce-
ment Torch Run. Meyers and 
his colleagues were even seen 
during Spring Carnival near 
Doherty Hall hosting Dunk-a-
Cop. The event was organized 
in part by Carnegie Mellon 
Police Detective Leah Noch in 
order to raise money for the 
games. The University Police 
Union pledged to match the 
amount raised at the event, 
amassing a total of $2,300. 
The of?cers will present a 
check to the Special Olym-
pics at the opening ceremony, 
which kicks off at 9 a.m. on 
Saturday. 
Detective Meyers, along 
with other LETR of?cers, will 
volunteer at Saturday’s games 
as “honor guards” during the 
opening ceremony and will be 
presenting awards throughout 
the games.
Program Director of SOPA 
and Western Competition 
Director for the Special 
Olympics Mike Ermer has been 
involved in the organization 
for seven years. He expressed 
his enthusiasm for bringing 
the games to Carnegie Mel-
lon’s campus, noting that 
moving this event, despite its 
magnitude, has been a goal of 
SOPA’s for a while. Lieutenant 
Meyers reached out to Ermer 
a couple of years ago, which 
allowed this goal to come to 
fruition. Now that the event 
is only days away, Ermer and 
his associates at SOPA are ea-
ger to see this dream become 
reality. “It is a great opportu-
nity to partner Special Olym-
pics with a great university, 
but even a better opportunity 
to have our athletes and the 
CMU population get to know 
each other. The impact each 
will make on the other will be 
life-changing,” Ermer said.
Special Olympics athlete 
Jessica Clayton has been par-
ticipating in the Olympics 
since she was nine years old. 
During Saturday’s games she 
will compete in walking, bowl-
ing, and bocce. She is most 
looking forward to being with 
her friends during the games 
and getting to showcase the 
hard work she has been doing 
during her training. In a mes-
sage to the Carnegie Mellon 
community, she invites us to 
“come and see what we’re go-
ing to be doing. It’s fun when 
people come and support us.”
Also participating in the 
games is Mikey Brecker, a self-
proclaimed “huge Penguins 
fan,” who will compete in bas-
ketball, soccer, and softball. 
Like Clayton, Brecker looks 
forward to hanging out with 
his friends during and after 
the games. He also likes saying 
cheers for his fellow athletes 
while they are competing. 
Brecker wants to wish all the 
athletes good luck at Satur-
day’s games and urges those 
coming out to donate. “I’d like 
us to raise a lot of money,” 
Brecker said.
The Tartan also spoke with 
Robert Mans?eld, who will 
compete in soccer, softball, 
and basketball. Mans?eld ?rst 
started participating in the 
games due to encouragement 
from his friends and family 
members. He is most looking 
forward to the tournament 
and getting to interact with 
the athletes. “It’s going to be 
an awesome experience,” said 
Mans?eld.
Clayton, Brecker, Mans-
?eld, and their fellow athletes 
have dedicated a lot of time 
and effort towards preparing 
for Saturday’s games. Unfor-
tunately, not many athletes 
get the support of friends and 
family members at the com-
petitions. It is important for 
Carnegie Mellon constituents 
to give back to the athletes, 
police of?cers, and faculty 
members who have given the 
community the opportunity to 
experience all the hard work 
and dedication that went in 
to bringing these games to 
campus.
Special Olympics of?cials 
invites all attending to become 
a “Fan in the Stand” by cheer-
ing on the athletes, making 
signs, clapping, whistling, 
making up chants, or anything 
to let them know you’re there 
and are supporting the ath-
letes. It’s a great way to get in-
volved in the games while also 
watching the athletes in ac-
tion. Special Olympics of?cials 
are also looking for volunteers 
to help throughout the day 
with basketball, track, aquat-
ics, tennis, awards, food, and 
other services.
Donations can be made 
and managed online at 
specialolympicspa.org.

tional encourages students to

events at Gesling Stadium this 
Saturday.
students will have better 
access to planning features, 
such as a calendar and com-
munication with advisers. 
Taylor explains that the site 
will also help promote stu-
dents’ relationships with their 
career consultants. “Very 
similar to Facebook, you can 
directly message your career 
consultant and don’t neces-
sarily have to email them. 
You can go back and forth 
with messages pre- or post- 
appointments.”
Another major change 
Taylor noted is the ?ltering 
system for job postings. “Let’s 
say Bank of New York Mellon 
has an internship position and 
they want to post it with Carn-
egie Mellon,” Taylor said. 
“They would have to sign up 
for a speci?c TartanTRAK 
account and post with us.” 
Taylor noted that this requires 
extra time for employers who 
seek Carnegie Mellon employ-
ees. “What Handshake does is 
an employer will just log on to 
their Handshake account and 
they have a list of all schools 
that currently use Handshake 
and can post with all schools 
with one click.” This makes 
the recruitment process not 
only easier for students utiliz-
ing Handshake, but also for 
employers who want to save 
time and effort. Taylor be-
lieves that this two-way ease 
of access will yield more job 
and internship opportunities 
for students. Overall, Taylor 
said that the main goal of 
switching to Handshake is “to 
create a more ef?cient way 
[for students] to ?nd the in-
formation that [they] need to 
be successful.”
The decision to transition 
from TartanTRAK to Hand-
shake was clear-cut. Student 
and CPDC feedback made it 
obvious that it was time for 
a new system. “At the CPDC, 
we always listen to what our 
students tell us. And we do our 
best to offer the top services, 
programs, and technologies 
in the ?eld to best connect 
CMU students with the oppor-
tunities they want most,” said 
Fenwick. “It didn’t take much 
feedback for us to know that 
the system we were on wasn’t 
evolving fast enough to meet 
the growing needs of our stu-
dents.” Fenwick noted that for 
the past four years the CPDC 
has been searching for the 
right tool to connect students 
with employers, job oppor-
tunities, and career building 
services offered by the CPDC. 
“We feel we ?nally found all 
of this when we discovered 
Handshake.”
Students should be 
aware of a couple things in 
preparation for the switch. 
TartanTRAK will be shut down 
at midnight on May 31, and, 
only seconds later on June 1, 
Handshake will be live and 
ready for use. Consequently, 
any and all information on 
TartanTRAK will be wiped out 
of the system. It is important 
that students download and 
save any important ?les that 
are stored on their Tartan-
TRAK accounts, such as re-
sumes and cover letters.
All new job postings will 
immediately be readily avail-
able on Handshake for stu-
dent access. Students can also 
begin to schedule appoint-
ments with their CPDC career 
consultants starting on June 
1. Students will continue to 
receive email reminders prior 
to the launch of the website.

On Thursday, April 21, the 
Academic Affairs Committee 
of the Undergraduate Student 
Senate released a white paper 
authored by sophomore com-
puter science major and Senate 
Academic Affairs (AA) Chair 
Eric Zhu, ?rst-year electrical 
and computer engineering 
and biomedical engineering 
double major Christina Ou, 
and ?rst-year Dietrich student 
Julia Luo. The paper detailed 
a case for creating an of?ce 
of diversity and inclusion at 
Carnegie Mellon University 
using money from the recent 
Marvell settlement.
The paper begins by 
mentioning that there is some 
version of this of?ce at each 
of Carnegie Mellon’s 13 peer 
institutions and that Carnegie 
Mellon is lagging behind them 
on this issue.
The paper made the 
argument that diversity and in-
clusion were key components 
of the Strategic Initiative 2025, 
but the university’s current 
strategy of a “grassroots ap-
proach” was insuf?cient. The 
authors wrote that “the Uni-
versity needs to hire individu-
als skilled in this speci?c area 
to be solely dedicated to mak-
ing sure we are doing the best 
we can. Without this direction, 
the development, implementa-
tion, and optimization of the 
recommended practices seem 
near-impossible.” They argued 
that directing efforts through 
a central of?ce would improve 
the steps taken by the univer-
sity and the public visibility of 
those steps, both improving the 
pursuit of their goals.
Zhu did not completely 
reject the idea of student-
created change; he felt, how-
ever, that it was not a suf?cient 
model to bring about meaning-
ful change at the university. “I 
think students can create some 
measure of change, as we’re 
kind of trying to do, but at the 
end of the day we’re full-time 
students and only doing any-
thing else part-time. And we 
leave after four years, which 
makes anything nearly as long 
term as change in a univer-
sity very dif?cult,” said Zhu in 
an email interview with The 
Tartan.
Students were consulted on 
the initiatives being outlined. 
Senate reached out to “maybe 
12 multicultural and interest 
groups,” according to Zhu, and 
received input from the Spanish 
and Latin Student Association 
(SALSA), the Korean Student 
Association (KSA), Colors@
CMU, and ALLIES. The groups 
expressed frustration because 
the responsibility to publicize 
the university’s diversity ser-
vices must fall to them. The 
authors felt that centralization 
would improve the ease of ac-
cessibility to the options avail-
able to students, writing in the 
white paper “a Google search 
for ‘Carnegie Mellon diversity 
resources’ returns a Diversity 
Resources Guide, the guide 
is outdated with no resources 
that would bene?t a student. 
Buried in the second page of 
results is CMARC’s [Carnegie 
Mellon Advising Resource Cen-
ter] website that then requires 
more searching to locate a 
‘Get Involved!’ page. Most stu-
dents will not go through this 
trouble.”
Zhu said much of this 
dif?culty to access information 
is “a product of the decentral-
ized nature of the university, 
but that’s no excuse. So, many 
students don’t know what 
CMARC is (I didn’t until very 
recently) and they don’t know 
what resources are available 
to them.” He argues that an of-
?ce of diversity and inclusion 
could go a long way towards 
remedying this problem.
The paper also suggested 
Brown University’s Diversity 
and Inclusion Action Plan as 
a potential source for the best 
practices to implement in 
order to make sure the of?ce is 
effective.
The idea to write the paper 
came from a drive for new ini-
tiatives that started over winter 
break. “I decided, along with 
my vice chair [and sophomore 
decision science major], Mi-
chael Gormley, to focus AA on 
policy and long-term solutions 
that we feel Senate is the best 
equipped to solve,” said Zhu.
He continued, saying “…the 
impetus for this really started 
when I attended the MLK ‘Con-
versation’ event in January. 
The student speakers section 
really, really moved me and 
got me thinking about the topic 
ever since. To be completely 
frank, I didn’t even know about 
many of the struggles that peo-
ple all around me have to face.”
The authors also expressed 
dissatisfaction with the current 
state of Carnegie Mellon’s di-
versity efforts. “I’ve always felt 
like CMU says a lot but doesn’t 
put much money or action 
where its mouth is, which re-
ally disappoints me,” said Zhu.
Ou perceives that “even 
within such a diverse campus, 
people stick to what they are 
most familiar with. If Carn-
egie Mellon’s setting were to 
change so that it would be 
easier to intermingle more, 
then that would be a great 
step towards more diversity 
and more interactions between 
students.” Luo agrees, adding 
that “there are a lot of people 
who hurt from not being [able] 
to get the resources they need 
to succeed.”
Zhu felt that an of?ce of 
diversity and inclusion would 
help to publicly shift the uni-
versity’s priorities. “I think that 
this is one of the unique oppor-
tunities for CMU to really show 
with money, not just words, its 
commitment to diversity. It’ll 
be a signal to future donors 
that this is a priority of the 
university,” he said.
The white paper was 
released after being passed 
unanimously by Senate on 
Thursday.

Developing a cure for can-
cer is one of the most dif?cult 
and most necessary initia-
tives in modern medicine. As 
of now, there are numerous 
treatments for various forms 
of cancers, and probably twice 
that amount of experimen-
tal trials attempting to defeat 
one of humanity’s most dan-
gerous diseases. One of the 
latest developments in can-
cer treatment is smart drug 
delivery, or targeting speci?c 
cells with speci?c doses rather 
than ?ooding a person’s whole 
body. Ideally, these treatments 
will be able to discriminate 
between cancer and patient, 
eliminating the disease and 
leaving the patient far healthi-
er than current treatments.
Currently, chemotherapy 
and radiation therapy are the 
two most widespread cancer 
treatment options, apart from 
surgery. Chemotherapy treat-
ments introduce chemicals 
toxic to cells into the blood 
stream, allowing the chemi-
cals to potentially treat cancer 
throughout the body. These 
chemicals affect cell division 
in a number of ways. There 
are cell-cycle-speci?c chemi-
cals, which target cells in the 
process of dividing, and cell-
cycle non-speci?c chemicals, 
which target cells at other 
times. Since the most notable 
property of cancer cells is that 
they divide rapidly, this seems 
like a fairly straight-forward 
treatment. However, this ap-
proach affects not only can-
cerous cells, but cells which 
divide rapidly such as hair; ep-
ithelial tissue,  which lines the 
digestive tract; and bone mar-
row, which produces blood 
cells. Since these cells are af-
fected, this leads to the most 
notable side-effects of chemo-
therapy treatments: hair loss, 
nausea, immunode?ciency, 
and a host of internal issues.
Like chemotherapy, ra-
diation treatments target cells 
undergoing the division pro-
cess. Radiation treatments 
use objects with high-energy 
emissions, such as gamma ra-
diation, x-rays, or charged par-
ticles, to target cells in certain 
cancerous areas. This disrupts 
cell division by breaking holes 
in the DNA of cancerous cells. 
These treatments are more 
targeted than chemotherapy, 
but they cannot speci?cally 
target cancer cells while leav-
ing surrounding healthy tissue 
unaffected.
Another major issue, at 
least with chemical treat-
ments, is that some cancers 
become resistant to the drugs 
used to ?ght them. This 
road block has led research-
ers down a path to discover 
smarter ways to target these 
drug-resistant cancer cells and 
how best to eliminate them. 
This method, called targeted 
drug delivery, involves tar-
geting speci?c cancerous cell 
types with deadly chemicals 
while leaving surrounding 
tissue unaffected. One of the 
most interesting questions this 
concept has posed is what to 
package these cancer-defeat-
ing drugs in. There are many 
questions that must be an-
swered before the perfect cap-
sule can be found. What kind 
of casing can be sturdy enough 
to transport the drug through 
the body without spilling it 
into the body? 
How can we ensure that the 
capsule will be accepted into 
the cancer cells and deliver the 
drug effectively?
The Tartan recently cov-
ered similar research coming 
out of Carnegie Mellon in No-
vember of 2015. This research 
focused on creating a liposo-
mal package out of phospho-
lipids, the same material that 
makes up a cell membrane, to 
deliver the anti-cancer drugs. 
This research was theoretical 
and modeled the concept of 
creating this capsule.
Researchers at The Ohio 
State University are using DNA 
origami structures to perform 
similar tasks. This research 
was conducted by John Byrd 
of The Ohio State University 
Wexner Medical Center, in 
collaboration with a number 
of colleagues. This particular 
study focused on a type of 
leukemia that had grown re-
sistant to a certain anti-cancer 
drug by adapting itself to rec-
ognize the deadly chemical 
and actively pump it out be-
fore it can affect the cell. The 
researchers noted very clearly, 
however, that the DNA capsule 
does nothing more than hold 
and camou?age the drug. One 
of the most interesting facets 
of this transport capsule, how-
ever, is that researchers “can

Has it ever confused you 
how you can convince people 
to pursue a speci?c behavior 
by telling them to do the op-
posite of what you wanted? 
If so, it is advised that you 
stop reading this article on 
how that persuasive tech-
nique, known as reverse 
psychology, works. After all, 
not everyone can handle the 
mental complexity behind a 
seemingly counter-intuitive 
phenomenon.
If your desire to continue 
reading suddenly increased, 
then you can probably under-
stand why reverse psychol-
ogy can, at times, be effective. 
According to howstuffworks.
com, reverse psychology en-
ables people to ful?ll a need 
for independence by doing 
something upon their free 
will, rather than being co-
erced into it. The theory was 
?rst brought to light by Ger-
man psychologists, Theodor 
Wiesengrund Adorno and 
Max Horkheimer, back in 
1970. Today, there are many 
examples of reverse psychol-
ogy that may seem familiar 
to you. For example, you may 
have had that odd temptation 
to put your hand over a red 
button, even though it clearly 
had a “Do not press” sign right 
above it. Reverse psychology 
is a technique that frequently 
shapes the ways people in-
teract with others, as well as 
their environments and even 
themselves.
Reverse psychology is both 
widespread and frequently 
used. In a 2011 survey con-
ducted by researchers from 
Universities of Toronto, Cen-
tral Arkansas (Conway), and 
Western Ontario, the majority 
of a group of college students 
said that they used reverse 
psychology on about a month-
ly basis. Furthermore, they 
found it to be just as effective 
as other in?uence tactics de-
?ned by social psychologists, 
including door-in-the-face, 
foot-in-the-door, and disrupt-
then-reframe.
Besides helping you sur-
reptitiously get what you 
want, reverse psychology 
can also help better people’s 
lives. Psychotherapists use a 
counseling technique involv-
ing a nuanced form of reverse 
psychology, called paradoxi-
cal intervention. During par-
adoxical intervention, the 
therapist prescribes the symp-
tom that a patient is seeking 
to ?x. For example, in 1975, 
two parents came to seek help 
from a University of Dela-
ware psychologist, Rachel T. 
Hare-Mustin, after having is-
sues with their four-year-old 
son’s frequent and capricious 
temper tantrums. The issue 
was corrected when the par-
ents were told to designate a 
time and place in which their 
son was encouraged to have 
a tantrum. To their surprise, 
the son’s tantrums had sig-
ni?cantly diminished within a 
few weeks.
By deliberately having un-
wanted symptoms, patients 
see the absurdity of the situ-
ation and realize that they 
can voluntarily avoid the 
symptom. In turn, paradoxi-
cal intervention reinforces 
the mindset that the patients 
have autonomy over their 
own behavior and experi-
ences. The technique, how-
ever, does raise some ethical 
concerns, including cases 
when the patient is struggling 
to ?x a dangerous or illegal 
behavior.
In fact, reverse psychology 
plays upon a psychological 
phenomenon known as reac-
tance. In 1976, University of 
Texas at Austin researchers 
found that people were more 
likely to write graf?ti when 
a sign on a college bathroom 
wall stated “Do not write on 
these walls under any circum-
stances,” rather when it said 
“Please do not write on the 
walls,” or even when no sign 
was present. Later on, Uni-
versity of Virginia researchers 
found that children formed a 
preference for a toy that they 
initially found unattractive 
and were told not to use. The 
same results were found from 
studies with adults.
The experiments 
serve as instances of 
the reactance theory, 
which was devel-
oped by Jack Brehm, 
a former University 
of Kansas profes-
sor. According to the 
theory, people react 
negatively when their 
freedom is threatened, 
and thus, they develop 
a desire to engage in a 
forbidden behavior. It 
shows the marked difference 
it can make when you politely 
ask someone to do something 
versus when you give your re-
quest in a demanding way.
People who like to be in 
control, from rebels to narcis-
sists, are more likely to be af-
fected by reverse psychology. 
The phenomenon also tends 
to work best when people are 
caught up in an emotional, 
rather than rational, state 
of mind. However, reverse 
psychology is susceptible to 
pitfalls. When you use it on 
someone, you may not always 
receive your intended effect. 
It can also teach others that 
you do not really mean what 
you say, or in some cases, it 
can make you come off as 
manipulative.
Reverse psychology 
can be applied in many 
different situations, 
whether it be when your 
parents were raising you 
during your rebellious 
teenage years, or when 
that salesman was try-
ing to sell you a car that 
you probably did not 
need. 
In more serious mat-
ters, it could be a tool 
you use in preventing 
the release of sensi-
tive information. Just 
reaching the end of this 
article showcases your 
natural dislike of being 
told what to do, as well as 
your innate desire for the 
freedom to decide the ac-
tions you take by yourself.

Researchers make material that can repair itself
An international team 
of researchers has created a 
material that can stretch to 
100 times its original length 
and is capable of self healing 
if punctured, according to 
a study published in Nature 
Chemistry. The material is so 
stretchy that, when originally 
testing it, the researchers did 
not have the proper equip-
ment to stretch it to its fullest 
potential.
“When we designed the 
material, we expected it to 
have high stretchability be-
cause we intentionally incor-
porated energy-dissipation 
sites into the polymers,” said 
Chao Wang, an assistant 
professor of chemistry at the 
University of California, Riv-
erside, and a co-author of the 
study.
The speci?c properties of 
this material make it ideal 
for the development of pros-
thetics and robots, and there 
is potential for the material 
to be linked to neurons and 
be driven by human neuron 
signals.

Supernova ashes rain rare iron isotope onto Earth 
Scientists have recently de-
tected trace elements that in-
dicate a supernova exploded 
in a nearby galaxy millions of 
years ago. 
The element, Fe-60, is a 
very rare, radioactive isotope 
of iron with a half-life of 2.6 
million years that is created 
when stars collapse during a 
supernova.
The Fe-60 was detected 
using the Cosmic Ray Isotope 
Spectrometer (CRIS) aboard 
NASA’s Advanced Composi-
tion Explorer (ACE), which 
is currently orbiting between 
Earth and the Sun. In the past 
17 years, CRIS has only de-
tected 15 Fe-60 nuclei.
“Our detection of radioac-
tive cosmic-ray iron nuclei is 
a smoking gun indicating that 
there has been a supernova 
in the last few million years 
in our neighborhood of the 
galaxy,” said Robert Binns, 
research professor of physics 
in Arts & Sciences at Washing-
ton University in St. Louis and

Fructose alters brain genes, slows problem-solving
Recently, in a study pub-
lished online in EBioMedi-
cine,  scientists at University of 
California, Los Angeles have 
determined that fructose, a 
common sugar in Western di-
ets, alters hundreds of genes 
in the brain and may be linked 
to a number of diseases. How-
ever, they also report that 
consuming docosahexaenoic 
acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty 
acid, reverses the harmful ef-
fects. DHA is naturally pro-
duced in small quantities in 
brain cell membranes, and it 
strengthens synapses and en-
hances learning and memory. 
It can be found in ?sh, nuts, 
vegetables, and fruits.
To compare the effects of 
fructose and DHA, research-
ers trained rats to escape from 
a maze; rats that consumed 
only fructose navigated the 
maze half as fast as the rats 
that consumed only water. 
Rats that consumed both 
fructose and DHA navigated 
the maze with times similar 
to those who consumed only 
water. Rats consuming only 
fructose also had much higher 
blood glucose, triglycerides, 
and insulin levels, which 
can result in diseases such as 
diabetes or obesity.

Solar-fueled plane completed ?ight across the Paci?c
A revolutionary solar-
powered airplane is ?ying 
its way from Hawaii to Cali-
fornia in a three-day ?ight. 
The aircraft, called Solar 
Impulse 2, originally took 
off in March 2015 from Abu 
Dhabi and has made stops in 
Oman, Myanmar, China, and 
Japan.
The carbon-?ber aircraft 
weighs about as much as a 
midsized truck and relies on 
nothing but energy from the 
sun to ?y. 
The ideal ?ight speed is 
28 mph, which can double 
during the day if the sun’s 
rays are strong. 
Its wings are equipped 
with 17,000 solar cells that 
power propellers and charge 
batteries. During the night, 
the plane runs on stored 
energy.
After the battery system 
sustained heat damage on its 
trip to Japan, the aircraft was 
forced to remain in Hawaii 
for nine months. There is a 
live feed documenting the 
entire journey online.

Unfamiliar setting keeps left half of brain awake
In a report published in 
Current Biology, scientists 
reveal that part of the left 
hemisphere of the brain re-
mains active while the brain 
is deeply asleep in unfamiliar 
surroundings. Researchers at 
Brown University monitored 
people’s sleeping patterns 
in their sleep lab to test for 
asymmetry in the brain. Dur-
ing a deep sleep stage called 
slow-wave sleep, a network 
of nerve cells in the left hemi-
sphere of the brain were not 
exhibiting as much sleep-
related bevior as the cor-
responding network on the 
right side, suggesting that the 
left side of the brain sleeps 
lighter than the right side. 
This could mean that one 
half of the brain is on guard 
when sleeping in unfamiliar 
settings. In support of this, 
the researchers’ results 
showed that the left side re-
acted quicker to quiet noises 
on the ?rst night of sleep, and 
the response time on the ?rst 
night was quicker than that 
on the second night.

Baby titanosaur fossil discovered in Madagascar
A fossil of a one- to 
two-month-old dinosaur 
has been discovered in 
Madagascar. 
The dinosaur is of the 
species Rapetosaurus krau-
sei, a member of a group 
of long-necked sauropod 
dinosaurs classified as 
titanosaurs.
The limb proportions of 
the baby dinosaur fossil are 
very similar to their adult 
counterpart, as reported in 
Science. 
This is a sign that baby 
titanosaurs did not require 
much parental supervi-
sion, according to study co-
author Kristi Curry Rogers, 
a vertebrate paleontologist 
at Macalester College in St. 
Paul, Minn.
From microscopic im-
ages and CT scans, the re-
searchers calculated that 
during the growth spurt, 
all of the baby’s limbs grew 
at about the same rate, 
and data from the dino-
saur’s bones suggest that 
it lived an active, indepen-
dent life up until it died of 
starvation.

THATCHER MONTGOMERY
Contributing Editor
At last week’s meeting, 
Pugwash joined Students 
for Science and Technology 
Policy to discuss whether the 
internet is a human right.
The question of what con-
stitutes a right was key to the 
discussion. The United Na-
tions (UN) has a list of hu-
man rights, including rights 
to life, liberty, and security, 
the right not to be discrimi-
nated against, and the rights 
to work, to have an adequate 
standard of living, and to ed-
ucation, to name a few. Does 
the internet belong on such a 
list?
One of the main uses of 
the UN list is as criteria for 
aid. Global organizations like 
the International Monetary 
Fund see the list as a set of 
checkboxes that need to be 
ticked off. If a country doesn’t 
meet the list of rights, they 
either won’t get aid or their 
development projects will 
come with the caveat that 
they have to work on improv-
ing those rights. The internet 
doesn’t seem to be something 
that a country should be re-
quired to have in order to re-
ceive international aid.
This suggested that rights 
are the things necessary to 
live a productive life. In de-
veloped countries, the inter-
net is an extremely important 
tool, both in personal and 
business settings. How can 
someone be expected to ap-
ply for a job without an email 
address? 
The internet is also very 
useful as an educational 
tool. However, these uses are 
context-dependent. Maybe in 
the United States, an email 
address is required to ap-
ply for a job, but it doesn’t 
seem necessary for a farmer 
in rural Africa, for example. 
Whether the internet is nec-
essary to function in society 
depends on the society, and 
a geographically-dependent 
right doesn’t seem like a right 
at all.
This is especially true 
when one considers all the 
other fundamentals needed 
before internet becomes use-
ful. internet access requires 
electricity, and it would be 
nice to have other things too, 
like clean drinking water or 
adequate shelter. If a country 
doesn’t have all those things, 
it doesn’t seem justi?ed for 
them to put in a request for 
internet access before ad-
dressing the other issues.
However, just because the 
internet isn’t required to live, 
doesn’t necessarily mean it 
shouldn’t be a right. 
Rights can be seen as the 
basic necessities needed to 
survive, but humans can live 
without justice, or liberty, or 
love. 
There’s a lot that can 
be taken away, and people 
will make do without. This 
doesn’t mean that those 
things shouldn’t be consid-
ered rights.
With the distinction be-
tween necessities to live and 
other things that would be 
nice to have, maybe rights 
should be ranked or put into 
some sort of hierarchical 
structure. First, basic necessi-
ties like food, water, and shel-
ter should be met. Education, 
religion, and other less tan-
gible rights would come next.
As one Pugwash member 
put it, by splitting up rights to 
live and rights to thrive there 
might be room for the inter-
net without making the very 
idea of the right seem frivo-
lous. There were some ideas 
that didn’t include the inter-
net at a basic human right. 
One was to treat the internet 
as a public utility, instead 
of a right. This would mean 
that while it’s not a required 
aspect of human existence, if 
it is present, it has to be fairly 
distributed and accessible. 
This would prevent monopo-
lies, like Facebook’s internet.
org initiative in developing 
countries, in which Face-
book would provide internet 
access for free but it would 
be limited to select websites 
chosen by Facebook. It would 
also address issues like inter-
net providers in the United 
States giving preferential or 
unfair treatment to certain 
users.
Another idea was that 
while the internet itself isn’t 
intrinsically a human right, 
it could be contextualized as 
such through the extensions 
of other rights. The right to 
education might require ac-
cess to online resources, or 
there might be a right to 
access public information, 
which would make internet 
access a very important way

At the IEEE International 
Conference on Big Data Se-
curity in New York City this 
month, researchers from 
MIT’s Computer Science 
and Arti?cial Intelligence 
Laboratory (CSAIL) and the 
machine-learning start-up 
PatternEx, presented a paper 
about their new security sys-
tem that combines machine 
learning approaches and 
input from human security 
experts. This system, called 
AI2 (named by merging “ar-
ti?cial intelligence” and “an-
alyst intuition”), has an 85 
percent success rate in identi-
fying threats and a false posi-
tive rate of 4.4 percent over 
a raw data set of 3.6 billion 
log lines. According to the 
paper, the three major chal-
lenges faced by the security 
industry are a lack of labelled 
examples to model learning 
models on, constant evolu-
tion of attacker’s methods, 
and limited reliance on se-
curity analysts to determine 
each threat’s risk factor. 
In fact, stand-alone ana-
lyst-driven approaches are 
limited in their effectiveness 
because of the fact that at-
tackers learn the behavior 
used by such systems to pre-
dict possible threats, and 
then work their way around 
that learned behavior in 
order to bypass security 
systems. 
Furthermore, only ma-
chine learning-based ap-
proaches can be inef?cient 
based on the fact that they 
raise a need for human 
investigation every time they 
come across an anomaly. 
The research team’s an-
swer to these hurdles in the 
?eld of security systems is 
to build a supervised model 
using three different unsu-
pervised models (learning 
models that don’t use any 
prior data or ‘labels’), which 
‘continuously re?nes itself.’ 
The paper lists four basic 
features that de?ne the sys-
tem: a big data behavioral 
analytics platform, various 
feature detection methods 
(outlier detection methods), 
a mechanism for obtaining 
feedback from security ana-
lysts, and a supervised learn-
ing module.
Basically, the system ana-
lyzes large-scale raw data 
using three learning models, 
after which it presents the 
analysis with a small portion 
of the data set based on the 
three models to obtain labels 
for each of the sets it wishes 
to identify. 
After collecting an ana-
lyst’s feedback about these 
data sets, it uses a supervised 
learning model (a learning 
model that predicts based on 
some previous training data) 
to further re?ne the process. 
The supervised model, 
used in conjunction with the 
three unsupervised ones, 
helps the system narrow 
down the data presented to 
the analyst in a short period 
of time, thereby cutting costs 
and inef?ciency.
In identi?cation of po-
tential attacks, the system 
uses variables that pinpoint 
to a particular behavior. 
Such variables de?ne the 
behavior that is a signature 
of an attack, which is simply 
a series of all the steps re-
quired to commit the security 
breach. 
Since this study was con-
ducted with data from an 
online enterprise system 
(typically a business organi-
zation), some of the data that 
the learning system stud-
ied included the login suc-
cess and failures over a time 
unit from a given IP address, 
minimum time from login to 
checkout, the different geo-
graphical locations that the 
user has checked into during 
a given time unit.
All of these factors, com-
bined in a unique manner, 
might be used to produce 
the behavioral signature of 
an attack, that the learning 
algorithm ‘learns’ to identify 
suspicious activity. 
Frauds that violate the 
terms of the service agree-
ment often have a distinct 
behavior signature. 
For example, abusive use 
of  promotional codes and 
manipulating web browser 
cookies to take part in a poll 
or draw multiple times. 
Therefore, as the system 
learns to identify previously 
‘unseen’ threats, it becomes 
better, showing 3.41 times 
improvement as compared to 
other unsupervised anomaly 
detectors, and decreasing 
false positives by ?vefold.
Since threats keep evolv-
ing, along with the increas-
ing importance of an infalli-
ble security system, any such 
system will involve human 
presence along with arti?cial 
intelligence to combat possi-
ble threats, as scientists try to 
study ways that would com-
pletely automate the process.

A medical animation of tumor cells metastasizing and encroaching on healthy cells in the same tissue, a prin-
cipal danger of cancer invasion. By stopping cancer cell division, these treatments can decrease this damage.
that researchers “can vary the 
shape or mechanical stiffness 
of a structure very precisely 
and see how that affects entry 
into cells,” according to Carlos 
Castro, director of the Labora-
tory for Nanoengineering and 
Biodesign, who collaborated 
with Byrd on this project. The 
particular anti-cancer drug 
the researchers used for this 
experiment is called daunoru-
bicin, a compound that inhib-
its cell growth by nudging it-
self into the DNA and sticking 
there, preventing proper cell 
division. This drug worked 
well in the DNA capsules be-
cause it naturally adhered 
to the capsule. This research 
showcases the usefulness of 
capsule technology in drug 
delivery, and has proven ef-
fective in both isolated leu-
kemia cells and solid tumors 
alike. The next step is translat-
ing these culture effects into 
animal models, so that the re-
search can be applied. While 
chemical treatments are being 
heavily pursued, the art of re-
searching smart ways to target 
and destroy cancerous tissue 
has multiple lines of inquiry 
within many laboratories 
across the world. Researchers 
at Shef?eld University in the 
United Kingdom have been 
experimenting using viruses, 
rather than drugs, as the 
principal method of cancer 
elimination. 
One of the best facets of 
this approach is that the vi-
ruses are self-replicating, so 
they can target tumors and 
keep up with the cells’ in-
tense growth cycles. They can 
also piggyback on the body’s 
natural immune response to 
chemotherapy. 
The procedure works by 
implanting macrophages, a 
type of white blood cell, with 
viruses and allowing them 
to naturally seek out tumor 
sites. In response to chemo-
therapy, the patient’s blood 
concentration of macrophages 
increases, and they rush to the 
affected tumor sites, respond-
ing to the chemical injuries 
sustained and attempting to 
heal the damage done. This 
treatment had prior success 
in animal models, and it will 
be experimentally tried on 15 
Shef?eld men with prostate 
cancer, the type of cancer with 
which this treatment has been 
tested.
Overall, experimental can-
cer treatments have come a 
long way in the recent past. 
Cancer research requires a 
good amount of innovation, 
considering the savagery of 
the disease and its adaptive 
nature. 
Only time will tell how can-
cer will be conquered, but in 
this era of heavy experimen-
tation, it’s interesting to con-
sider the routes by which this 
victory might be won.

This is your brain on 
drugs! But more importantly 
this is also your brain not on 
drugs. In a series of brightly 
colored collages of “lit-up” 
brains, neuroscientists Robin 
Carhart-Harris, David Nutt, 
et al. released their ?ndings 
on the ?rst modern imaging 
studies of human participants 
on Lysergic Acid Diethylam-
ide (LSD). While there has 
been previous work done on 
the effects of psychedelics 
and the brain, many of these 
studies are limited by meth-
odological concerns, legal is-
sues, and their lack of scope. 
Like many secondary reports 
on psychopharmacological 
research, these reports ignore 
the fact that these brains are 
still a product of their previ-
ous experiences and envi-
ronments. These drugs don’t 
create new neural networks, 
they work with and augment 
systems that exist in the de-
fault brain, which can vary 
drastically. The limitations of 
prior research have led to a 
multitude of current research 
on these substances, includ-
ing a study published by Car-
hart-Harris and Nutt.
LSD was ?rst synthesized 
in 1938 by Alfred Hoffman.It 
is derived from ergotamine, 
a component of ergot fun-
gus, which is a type of mold 
that grows on rye bread. 
Soon after its psychoactive 
(brain-altering) properties 
were discovered in 1943, it 
became a part of psychologi-
cal “research,” which ranged 
from psychoanalysis sessions, 
to marriage counseling, to the 
infamous CIA trials to put sol-
diers through “living hell,” to 
getting dolphins to trip. This, 
and the rise in the recreation-
al use, led to governments 
around the world prohibiting 
the drug and keeping it under 
strict control. Until recently, 
this conversation around 
LSD has remained stuck in 
the world of the 1950’s. Even 
now, as research is expand-
ing in the ?eld of psychedelic 
neuroscience, studies are 
often fettered by the drug’s 
complicated past. 
LSD is an organic mol-
ecule that is able to cross 
the blood-brain-barrier, 
meaning it can 
interact 
with 
neurons and receptors in the 
brain. From there, LSD is able 
to interact with many differ-
ent receptors. On some re-
ceptors, it acts as an agonist, 
activating speci?c cellular 
pathways in neural circuits. 
On others, it is an antagonist, 
blocking these receptors and 
preventing the activation of 
these neural circuit pathways. 
While we know a little about 
how these molecules bind to 
receptors at a biochemical 
level, there is still uncertainty 
about how this affects larger 
sections of the brain. Existing 
research regarding systems 
related to LSD functionality 
centered around the medial 
temporal lobes, which 
are involved in processing 
vision, language, and emo-
tion. Patients with part of 
their medial temporal lobes 
removed showed diminished 
LSD effects, and electrical 
stimulation of these regions 
is known to produce dream-
like “visions” and distortions 
to visual perception similar 
to those associated with LSD. 
However, the effect of this 
substance on the brain can-
not be isolated to a singular 
brain area or receptor type. 
In order to understand the 
effect of any molecule in the 
brain, we must consider how 
that substance interacts with 
the brain as a whole. The 
aforementioned study, led by 
Carhart-Harris and Nutt, not 
only sheds light on how LSD 
interacts with larger scale 
neural systems, but also clari-
?es how certain parts of the 
brain interact.
Carhart-Harris and Nutt’s 
study provides evidence that 
LSD promotes interaction 
between regions of the brain 
that are normally thought to 
have discrete psychological 
functions such as emotion, 
sound, or cognition. This in-
creased interaction between 
traditionally separated parts 
of the brain helps explain 
some of the common traits 
associated with LSD such as 
geometric visual patterns, 
impaired motion perception, 
and auditory synesthesia 
(hearing sounds when oth-
er senses, such as vision, 
are stimulated).
Carhart-Harris and 
Nutt also found a corre-
lation between 
LSD and 
decreased connection in the 
Default Mode Network, a 
network thought to be the 
foundation for a person’s 
understanding of “self.” The 
breakdown of these connec-
tions mirrors the loss of self-
identity that is a part of the 
LSD experience. 
Carhart-Harris and Nutt 
explain that these ?ndings 
could have important impli-
cations in a variety of ?elds 
of study, saying “in the same 
way the neurobiology of psy-
chedelic induced visual hal-
lucinations can inform on the 
neurobiology of visual pro-
cessing, so the neurobiology 
of psychedelic-induced ego 
dissolution can inform on the 
neurobiology of the ‘self’ or 
‘ego.’” While this study made 
signi?cant headway in uncov-
ering correlations between 
states of consciousness and 
brain activity in the presence 
of LSD, it is still uncertain how 
this can be applied to normal 
brain function. Further stud-
ies are needed to really un-
derstand how distinct brain 
regions are connected. LSD 
has been used in trials to help 
treat anxiety disorders and 
cluster headaches and has 
had astoundingly positive re-
sults. LSD has also been fruit-
ful in studying other disease 
states, since some of the same 
regions and neurotransmitter 
receptor systems are impli-
cated in forms of depression 
and schizophrenia. By focus-
ing on what these LSD studies 
can tell us about brain con-
nectivity and normal brain 
function, LSD studies could 
become an important part of 
neuroscience research. While 
headlines of “Your Brain on 
LSD” grab attention, they pro-
vide only a cursory glance at 
the complex and intricate re-
lation between your brain and 
the world around it. Hope-
fully, with further studies of 
this type, we can continue to 
unravel the enigma that is the 
phenomenology of human 
brain, be it on drugs or not.

Research coming out of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Scientific 
Imaging and Brain Research 
Center (SIBR) shows that to 
learn and understand new 
physics concepts, our brain 
repurposes ancient struc-
tures that are used for every-
day purposes such as motion 
and time intervals. 
This concept goes back to 
the idea that when we learn, 
we relate old information 
to new ideas. For example, 
when envisioning gravity 
and potential energy, your 
brain relates the concept to 
an apple falling from a tree. 
When learning periodic 
circular motion, your brain 
may associate it with the re-
peating rhythms of music 
and dance. This research was 
carried out by Marcel Just, 
the D. O. Hebb Professor of 
Psychology at Carnegie Mel-
lon, and senior research psy-
chologist Robert Mason. 
For these experiments, 
nine right-handed students 
(three females and six males 
between the ages of 19 and 
25) from physics and engi-
neering departments partici-
pated in the study. 
They were required to 
think about common physics 
concepts in a way that they 
understood. Researchers 
then set up a machine learn-
ing computer program to 
identify the concepts’ neural 
correlates by analyzing brain 
images. Participants were 
required to think about the 
physics concepts six times. 
Researchers trained the 
computer on five sets of those 
brain images. Then, during 
the sixth presentation, they 
asked the computer to iden-
tify what physics concept 
the participant was thinking 
about from a dataset. The 
program was able to identify 
the concept with a high level 
of accuracy, but that was only 
half of the researchers’ goal. 
They were also curious 
about which neural prop-
erties of the brain allowed 
the program to identify the 
concepts. 
After examining the re-
sults of the experiments, re-
searchers found that humans 
are able to learn new physics 
concepts because our brains 
are programmed to be able 
to understand four main cat-
egories: causal motion, mo-
tion with cause and effect 
relations; periodicity, the 
repetition of the same mo-
tion or phenomenon; energy 
flow, the transport of energy 
from one body to another; 
and algebraic representa-
tion, the ability to retrieve 
a characteristic algebraic 
equation associated with a 
scientific variable. 
Because all new physics 
concepts may fall into one of 
these categories, or at least 
have some correlation with 
the four characteristics, our 
brain is able to encode almost 
all new physics concepts we 
learn about. 
Moreover, the research 
shows that each partici-
pant’s brain shows the same 
activation pattern in certain 
regions when learning the 
same new concept. That is 
to say, we learn things in the 
same way as others do. 
“Even though each stu-
dent may have acquired their 
physics knowledge in 
different classrooms or un-
der different methods, [the 
results] were all predict-
able when the computer was 
trained on the data of the 
students," Mason said. 
"This is why humans have 
been able to move ahead and 
innovate — because we can 
use our brain for new pur-
poses.” 
According to Just, “Hu-
man brains haven’t changed 
much over a few thousand 
years, but new fields like 
aeronautics, genetics, medi-
cine, and computer science 
have been developed and 
continuously change.” 
This experiment consti-
tutes researchers’ first at-
tempt at finding a neural cor-
relate for abstract concepts 
that are typically acquired 
through schooling. This re-
search fits nicely as part of 
an ongoing project to map 
out the neural dimensions of 
semantic knowledge across a 
variety of domains. 
“It will be interesting 
to determine the nature of 
brain representations for 
additional science concepts 
such as genetics, chemistry 
or biology," Mason said. 
"We hope [these] neural 
knowledge representations 
will be useful for educa-
tion research, potentially 
for brain-based instruction 
or evaluation and testing of 
knowledge using brain-based 
assessment.” 
Furthermore, if we could 
understands how the brain 
encodes new scientific con-
cepts, future education 
would be able to utilize this 
and provide better teaching 
and learning experience for 
education.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
At the close of every school year, The 
Tartan reassesses the year’s events. 
We present here a list of the people 
and happenings that are worthy of 
recognition. Thistles go to people and 
events that had a positive effect on the 
campus community and the world at 
large; thorns go to those that have 
negatively impacted the community.
A thistle to the people who or-
ganized or participated in 
Black Lives Matter marches and die-
ins across the country and at 
Carnegie Mellon. There are serious 
systemic issues with policing in this 
country that need to be exposed and 
talked about honestly, and it was 
great to see Carnegie Mellon adding 
its voice to that discussion.
A thorn to Carnegie Mellon’s 
Software Engineering Institute 
(SEI) for handing over research that 
cracked Tor, revealing the identities 
of thousands of internet users who 
were attempting to remain anony-
mous. As an institution on the cut-
ting edge of technological develop-
ment, Carnegie Mellon as a whole 
and SEI speci?cally are helping 
shape the future of the Internet. 
They should be working to preserve 
the freedom of the Internet and de-
fend user privacy.
A thistle to Vaasavi Unnava for 
being elected Student Body 
President with Aaron Gutierrez as 
Student Body Vice President. The 
campus will be relying on them for 
leadership in the upcoming year.
A thorn to Mitch McConnell 
for waiting less than an hour 
after President Obama’s nomination 
of Merrick Garland as a Supreme 
Court Justice to reject him as a candi-
date. He clearly did not even bother 
considering Garland’s quali?cations, 
and instead used this important pro-
cess to win points in petty partisan 
squabbles. Garland is a moderate 
and well-quali?ed candidate that de-
serves the respect of a proper vetting 
process.
A thistle to all of the booth 
building organizations for 
overcoming the challenges of the re-
location of Carnival. The College of 
Fine Arts parking lot is on a slope and 
very unlike the ?at terrain of the 
Morewood Gardens parking lot, but 
the organizations adjusted gracefully 
to bring us the Carnival experience 
we all know and love.
A thorn to the water main un-
der Forbes Avenue for breaking 
and shutting down the road so all the 
cars were funneled onto Fifth Ave-
nue, resulting in such chaotic traf?c 
that a student’s foot got run over. 
The steady stream of pedestrians 
across Fifth deserves better defense 
from motor vehicles in these trying 
times.
A thistle to the water main un-
der Forbes for liberating pedes-
trians from the tyranny of the motor 
vehicle. Forbes was much easier to 
cross for a few blissful weeks as stu-
dents rushed to class.
A thorn to American media 
consumers for thinking Al 
Jazeera was a terrorist organization 
for so long that Al Jazeera America 
was driven of?ine. Our culture of 
fear and Islamophobia has become 
so pervasive that people cannot tell a 
well-respected journalistic organiza-
tion from a terrorist cell. Fueled by 
ignorance, this fear will become self-
perpetuating unless we listen to a 
range of different media outlets and 
perspectives.
A thistle to The International 
Consortium of Investigative 
Journalists for The Panama Papers, a 
global effort of more than 400 jour-
nalists to expose the off-shore hold-
ings of world leaders. In a similar 
vein, a thistle to BuzzFeed for its re-
cent investigative pieces on every-
thing from match ?xing to for-pro?t 
foster care.
A thorn to Overheard at Carn-
egie Mellon, once a place for 
light-hearted Carnegie Mellon 
themed fun, for descending into vit-
riolic comments and petty bickering. 
The page used to be a place to laugh 
together about the silly quirks of our 
community, but it is no longer 
serving its purpose.
A thistle to the Carnegie Mel-
lon construction team for ?n-
ishing the renovations on both the 
Cohon Center and Scott Hall. These 
new additions provide much needed 
facilities to campus and are yet an-
other sign of our university’s rapid 
development in recent years.
A thorn to whoever unlawfully 
removed the beloved card-
board cutout of David Tepper from 
Posner Hall. It’s probably serving as 
excellent nice dorm room decor, 
though.
A thistle to Scott Hall speci?-
cally for providing a home for 
the Biomedical Engineering depart-
ment, along with Nano Fabrication 
and the Wilton E. Scott Institute for 
Energy Innovation. With new labora-
tories and a cleanroom facility, the 
building will help our STEM depart-
ments continue to excel. Not to men-
tion it connects Porter, Roberts, 
Hamerschlag, and Wean Halls, giv-
ing students a way to avoid the rain 
and cold for even longer as they 
rush between classes.
A thorn to Snapchat for mark-
ing 4/20 with a Bob Marley ?l-
ter that reduced an iconic singer to a 
symbol for weed using a lens that 
basically amounted to digital black-
face. The lens showed a stupefying 
lack of historical awareness on the 
part of Snapchat. In a nation with a 
long and painful history surrounding 
blackface, both individuals and com-
panies should do their research 
before making light of it.
A thistle to Hillary Clinton for 
visiting our campus on her 
presidential primary circuit. Her visit 
was a great way for students to en-
gage with politics, be it by cheering 
in the crowd at the rally or chanting 
protest slogans outside with a pa-
pier-mâché Bernie Sanders. It’s in-
credibly important to engage young 
voters in the election process since 
we are the future of America’s 
democracy.
A thorn to the Mississippi and 
North Carolina legislators for 
passing such blatant and aggressive 
anti-LGBT+ legislation that the Brit-
ish government published a travel 
warning to LGBT+ people visiting 
the states. It is troubling to live in a 
country where local governments so 
brazenly approve of discrimination.
A thistle to Governor Tom Wolf 
for making Pennsylvania the 
26th state to legalize medical mara-
juana, and not letting decades of 
stigma get in the way of medical 
research. 
A thorn to Pennsylvania Sena-
tor Pat Toomey for failing to 
uphold his duty to represent his con-
stituents and instead getting en-
snared in petty Washington politics. 
His attempt to block the moderate 
Supreme Court justice candidate 
President Obama nominated from 
being approved represents a betrayal 
of his constituents and his 
constitutional duties.
A thistle to the Market District 
Giant Eagle for extending its 
hours back to midnight. The later 
hours are much more convenient for 
students  who want the comfort or 
cost effectiveness of a home cooked 
meal.
A thorn to the recent construc-
tion for making campus noisy 
and dif?cult to navigate this year. 
While progress is great, the current 
group of students de?nitely got the 
short end of the stick with the reno-
vations. Students will ?nd a beauti-
ful, bulldozer free Mall when they 
return in the fall, but will have to 
keep listening to the jackhammer 
choir in the Morewood parking lot 
for quite some time.
A thistle to The Underground 
for also extending its hours, in 
this case to 2 a.m., to compensate for 
the closure of Skibo. Milkshakes, 
greasy fries, and excessive amounts 
of melted cheese at midnight are a 
staple of the undergraduate college 
experience, and The Underground 
ensured that this year’s ?rst-years 
didn’t miss out on it.
A thorn to Donald Trump, for 
the plethora of reasons that 
have been addressed in these pages 
throughout the year.
A thistle to our readership for 
seeing us through another 
great year at The Tartan.

Pennsylvanians will vote in their 
primary on Tuesday and the focus 
has largely surrounded the races for 
the major party nominations for the 
Presidency, Senate, and House of 
Representatives. 
While these primaries are all very 
important, the state government 
races have a much more direct im-
pact on the lives of Pennsylvanians.
Our votes are also more power-
ful in these races because of the 
smaller voting body.
Pennsylvanians represent a rela-
tively small chunk of all Americans, 
controlling less than 10 percent of 
the Electoral College. We control 
two percent of the Senate, like ev-
ery other state. And even though we 
get our proportionate share of the 
435 representatives in the House, 
that power is disproportionately 
concentrated in House leadership. 
State elections, on the other hand, 
have a smaller electorate and put 
people directly into positions of 
power. Therefore, voters have to 
pay attention to these races and cast 
well-informed votes.
More speci?cally, Pennsylvania 
voters should give special consider-
ation to the Attorney General race 
this Tuesday.
The Attorney General serves as 
the chief legal and law enforcement 
of?cer of the Commonwealth, par-
ticularly charged with prosecuting 
public corruption and organized 
crime. 
The Attorney General also serves 
on seven different state boards and 
committees. These responsibilities 
are essential to a functioning state 
government.
Usually, it is safe to re-elect in-
cumbents who have not done dam-
age in state of?ces because they 
have proven they can do the job. 
This year, however, Pennsylvania 
Attorney General Kathleen Kane 
has exited the race. 
Kane is currently under indict-
ment for perjury and obstruction 
following a leak of con?dential 
information to a local newspaper. 
Regardless of how we feel about 
Kane’s actions and indictment, we 
must take the time and do the re-
search on all candidates in order to 
judge who is the most quali?ed to 
take over for Kane.
Thirty minutes and a critical 
Google search on each of your par-
ty’s candidates are all it takes to turn 
up some distinct differences among 
their intentions for the position. We 
found one important difference — 
some make their platforms clear 
and some don’t talk about it at all.
On the Democratic side, two 
candidates have a realistic shot 
at the nomination. Montgomery 
County Commissioner Josh Shapiro 
and District Attorney of Allegheny 
County Stephen Zappala are in a 
very tight race for the Democratic 
nomination, with John Morganelli 
trailing behind.
Shapiro is currently running 
with President Barack Obama’s en-
dorsement. Environmentalism has 
been a core part of Shapiro’s cam-
paign, which is largely consistent 
with what the Obama administra-
tion has been pushing in recent 
months. Shapiro has said that he 
will pursue legal action against 
companies where there are damag-
es to water and air due to fracking. 
He has also been a proponent of 
cracking down on gun violence, 
advocating for increased policing 
of ?rearms and fewer loopholes for 
gun purchases.
Shapiro currently serves as a 
county commissioner in Mont-
gomery County in southeast 
Pennsylvania near Philadelphia. 
However, county commissioner is 
a largely administrative role that 
heads county government, a sig-
ni?cantly smaller job than attorney 
general.
Stephen Zappala, a Pittsburgh 
native and Allegheny County Dis-
trict Attorney since 1998, is run-
ning his platform on his prosecu-
torial record and his story. He’s a 
hard-working Pennsylvanian from 
an immigrant family with a “pas-
sion for fairness.” Zappala paid for 
his undergraduate degree at the 
University of Pittsburgh by work-
ing as a “card-carrying union Boil-
ermaker.” Then he earned his law 
degree at Duquesne, and, after 14 
years of private practice, he went 
on to serve ?ve terms as District At-
torney. In his years of service, Zap-
pala has been tough on child abuse, 
animal abuse, elder abuse, domes-
tic violence, veteran’s issues, and 
public corruption.
Even though his campaign lacks 
any real platform, Zappala is neck 
and neck with Shapiro in the polls. 
We endorse Shapiro for his dedica-
tion to action over Zappala’s empty 
platform.
The Republican race looks more 
cut and dry. John Rafferty’s cam-
paign has raised more money and 
received more endorsements than 
his competitor Joseph Peters.
Peters began his career as a po-
lice of?cer in Scranton, then moved 
to the White House to manage the 
High Intensity Drug Traf?cking 
Area (HIDTA) program in 26 Amer-
ican cities. He has a tough record on 
drug and terror, and made his name 
by convicting Philadelphia mob 
boss “Little Nicky” Scarfo and his 
entire crew. He claims to be tough 
on drugs and terror, but he is also 
tough on gun reform and women’s 
reproductive rights. In addition, he 
served as Communications Director 
under Kathleen Kane.
Opponent and likely victor John 
Rafferty has served as State Sena-
tor of the 44th district, including 
parts of Montgomery, Chester, and 
Burkes Counties, since 2003, and 
before that worked as a private at-
torney. Like Zappala, Rafferty is 
taking the good guy with a good 
story approach. In a statement fol-
lowing the Pennsylvania Attorney 
General Candidate Forum, Rafferty 
said: “My number one priority is 
to restore integrity and bring solid 
principled leadership to the Of?ce 
of Attorney General. The Of?ce of 
Attorney General has suffered from 
scandals, controversy and most im-
portant a lack of strong leadership.” 
He went on to reinforce Peters’ con-
nection to Kane, still not offering 
any platform items beyond reintro-
ducing integrity.
Despite our feelings on Peters’ 
pro-life and pro-second amendment 
stance, we have more con?dence in 
his strength and his quali?cations 
for the of?ce. Peters’ platform has 
clear vision and direction, but Raf-
ferty’s depends on his past more 
than his future.
Whether you agree that the race 
should come to Shapiro and Peters 
or not, you should research your 
party’s candidates and their plat-
forms so you have an opinion. Show 
up to the polls this week, and cast a 
vote you believe in. 
AG race comes to fore with Kane’s legal woes

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
New experience initiatives sound great, if they happen 
This Wednesday, April 20, Presi-
dent Subra Suresh sent an email to 
the campus community announc-
ing new plans to “[enrich] the CMU 
experience,” inspiring cautious 
optimism.
In the email, Suresh outlined six 
action items: he will form a Presi-
dent’s Advisory Board for the CMU 
Experience; Provost Farnam Ja-
hanian will convene a campus-wide 
task force on the student experience; 
the Eberly Center will create a pilot 
program to enhance student experi-
ence in the classroom; the Univer-
sity will open a new wellness center 
twice the current size; Counseling 
and Psychological Services (CaPS) 
will improve access to care; and the 
Cyert Center for Early Education will 
double its enrollment to accommo-
date graduate students and faculty 
members with children.
Altogether, these steps are a 
promising start. It is important to 
balance long term aims to change 
campus culture with more short 
term improvements to resources like 
CaPS and the Cyert Center for Early 
Education, and these steps seem to 
do that. But they are only a start.
Campus administration likely 
feels pressure to offer a quick re-
sponse to complaints students have 
brought to the President’s Of?ce 
this semester. The suicides in March 
were symptomatic of a dangerous 
culture that we have known exists 
for a long time. The campus com-
munity reacted with the strength of 
its frustration, revitalizing old griev-
ances in face of the inaction from the 
university on a serious, long-term 
public health issue.
Because of the pressure, these 
announcements are coming pre-
maturely. The plans they promise 
are not yet developed enough. Even 
though conversations have begun, 
the announcement came before the 
members of the advisory board or 
the task force could be chosen. Most 
of the more active items still do not 
include timelines.
Students are justi?ably hungry 
for a meaningful change in our CMU 
Experience. We do not want to be 
spoon fed false promises while gen-
tle rhetoric encourages us to open 
wide.
These proposals outlined by 
President Suresh are good ideas that 
could end up bearing fruit in the fu-
ture, once concrete plans have been 
drawn. The Eberly Center’s program 
to analyze classroom culture and the 
Cyert Center enrollment increase are 
appropriate answers to the serious 
problems our campus faces, and on 
the surface, they seem to show prob-
lem-solving initiative.
However, without names of peo-
ple in charge of the planning, spe-
ci?c timelines, and speci?c goals, 
they only show that people intend to 
talk about talking about problems on 
campus. 
The administration has defaulted 
on promised change before. Improv-
ing campus diversity has long been 
a goal touted by the administration, 
but just this week the Student Sen-
ate’s white paper highlighted how 
little tangible progress has been 
made. 
With this recent example of how 
jargon does not necessarily lead to 
results on our minds, it is reasonable 
to be suspicous of the new initiatives.   
The Tartan is eager to see how 
these projects play out and if the Uni-
versity will make good on its prom-
ises. Until then, we remain skeptical.
SYDNEY ROSLIN
On April 6, a senior from the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley took a 
call from his uncle while sitting on 
the tarmac in a Southwest Airlines 
?ight. As he chatted on the phone, 
a woman in the seat in front of him 
got up to get a ?ight attendant. A few 
minutes later, a Southwest employee 
asked the man to leave the plane, and 
escorted him into the company of po-
lice of?cers where he was questioned, 
restrained, and prodded by the of?-
cers, detection dogs, and FBI agents, 
causing the man to miss his ?ight. 
He was eventually released, but told 
that he could not ?y with Southwest 
Although he was able to get a refund 
and book a new ?ight with Delta Air 
Lines, he arrived back in Berkeley 
nine hours after his intended arrival.
The man had not been acting 
abrasively to the staff or passengers, 
he was not carrying anything illegal, 
and was not posing a threat to any-
one on the plane. There was only one 
thing set that him apart from his fel-
low passengers, which lead to his dis-
missal from the ?ight. The student, 
Khairuldeen Makhzoomi, is Iraqi, 
and spoke Arabic over 
the phone.
Islamophobia has 
become a huge issue in 
the U.S in the ?fteen 
years since 9/11, and 
in the wake of acts of 
terrorism lead by ISIS. 
The approximately 
3.3 million Muslims 
living in America are 
constantly being dis-
criminated against, 
stereotyped, and seen 
as an “other.” In the case of Makh-
zoomi, a Southwest employee asked 
him “Why would you speak Arabic 
on a plane? It’s dangerous. You know 
the environment around the air-
port. You understand what’s going 
on in this country.” Just like the way 
words such as “bomb” are taboo in an 
airport, it seems like the Arabic lan-
guage is becoming taboo, despite the 
fact that more than 950,000 people 
in this country speak the language 
?uently. This is characterizing an en-
tire segment of  American citizens by 
the actions of a select few extremists. 
This is turning a language, a religion, 
and a culture into something that is 
seen as a threat to our country.
Islamophobia is not a new thing, 
and, unfortunately, is being perpe-
trated not just by everyday citizens, 
but in our government as well. Under 
the guise of national security, nor-
mal, innocent people are becoming 
the target of hatred and bigotry. After 
9/11, for example, Congress quickly 
passed legislation that granted broad 
new powers to federal law enforce-
ment in the U.S. to gather and inves-
tigate anyone suspected of terrorism. 
The USA Patriot Act, as it was 
named, was extremely detrimental 
to the civil liberties of Muslims and 
Arab Americans, and most of the alle-
gations made under the provisions of 
the Patriot Act were directed at Mus-
lim Americans or Americans of 
Arab descent. In the post-9/11 panic 
and rush to ensure national security, 
many of these people were detained 
without reasonable charge, verbally 
and physically abused, spied on, 
and even blacklisted from ?nancial 
institutions.
Now, 15 years later, this type of 
discrimination is still being perpetrat-
ed. People like Makhzoomi are being 
subjected to racial pro?ling, forced 
to apologize for their religion and 
culture, blatantly targeted by presi-
dential campaigns, and have done 
nothing to deserve this treatment. It’s 
not as if we do not know the conse-
quences of this type of hatred. We 
have seen time and time again 
the destruction that is caused 
when we start judging seg-
ments of the population as a 
group. We only need to turn to 
history to witness tragedies such 
as the Armenian genocide, the Cam-
bodian genocide, and the atrocities 
committed against Native Americans, 
and to understsand the cost in human 
life of discrimination and senseless 
hatred in these situations.
The ISIS extremists that have per-
petrated the acts of terrorism that 
we as a country fear are just that — 
extremists. They do not in any way, 
shape, or form represent all Muslims, 
or all people of Arab descent. Muslims 
and people of Arab descent should 
not be judged as members of ISIS and  
should not be discriminated against 
because they share a religion or an 
ethnicity. The goal of terrorism is to 
strike fear in our 
hearts, and 
we need to 
precent that fear from dictating our 
actions and override our moral com-
passes.
Yes, this is a simple case of a man 
being asked to leave an airplane. But 
it is representative of so much more. 
Because if Makhzoomi had been Cau-
casian, or if he had been speaking 
French, or Spanish, or Chinese, he 
would not have been asked to leave 
the ?ight. He just happened to share 
a language and an 
ethnicity 
with 
members of 
a terrorist organization, but also 
with hundreds of millions of people 
in the world who have the right to 
not be judged based on their culture 
and heritage.

Islamophobia hijacks American values, perpetuates terror
India Price/Online Editor
The university administration 
should ban all future weapons re-
search on the grounds that it vio-
lates the policy on Academic and 
Individual Freedom and is against 
the principles of our founder, An-
drew Carnegie. Research funding 
at the university includes millions 
of dollars in government contracts, 
some of which is used to research 
weapons, or technology that can be 
weaponized for the U.S. military. 
For example, in 2014, the Software 
Engineering Institute contributed 
to research on drones, which have 
been used by the U.S. military to de-
stroy both military and civilian tar-
gets. Nearly 90 percent of the people 
killed in drone attacks in Afghani-
stan were civilians. This is clearly 
contrary to the university’s policy 
on Academic and Individual Free-
dom that states, “Intentional acts 
threatening personal safety ... will 
not be tolerated.” Weapons research 
includes research on technology 
and devices that threaten personal 
safety and clearly violates this com-
munity’s ethics.
Weapons research is also con-
trary to the values of the university’s 
founder, Andrew Carnegie, one of 
the foremost advocates for peace in 
his time. At the dawn of World War I, 
he became the president of the New 
York Peace Society. He also met with 
world leaders and lobbied countries 
— including the U.S., Great Britain, 
Germany, Russia, and France — to 
promise not to go to war with one 
another. In 1910, Andrew Carnegie 
founded the Carnegie Endowment 
for International Peace, which is still 
in operation. It seems likely that he 
would not support any of the uni-
versity’s contracts with the military, 
especially those that aid armed con-
?ict. Any current contracts should 
be allowed to continue, but no con-
tracts should be renewed or created 
if they involve weapons research. 
The university community should 
be critical of the work done in Carn-
egie’s name and hold the university 
to the highest ethical standards.

cision sciences. 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR: END 
CMU MILITARY CONTRACTS  

---------------------------------------------------

DORSA MASSIHPOUR

During this presidential election, 
there has been a lot of debate about 
raising the federal minimum wage. 
From the beginning of his run for 
president, Democratic candidate Ber-
nie Sanders has made it clear that he 
supports raising the minimum wage 
to $15 per hour. On the other hand, 
his opponent Hillary Clinton has 
taken a different approach that many 
?nd dif?cult to understand.
Clinton ?rst gave her opinion on 
minimum wage during the Demo-
cratic debate on April 14. She stated 
that she would sign a bill to increase 
the federal minimum wage to $15, but 
added that she favors a slightly differ-
ent change in federal wages. Recently, 
she has stated that her ideal model is 
based around the changes that have 
been made in New York — initially 
creating a $12.50 minimum wage in 
rural areas and $15 minimum wage in 
the city.
She has received much criticism 
for her opinion on minimum wage, 
mainly because people feel that her 
position is not a straightforward one. 
Contrary to her statements during 
this Democratic debate, Clinton sup-
ported changing minimum wage to 
$12 per hour at the beginning of her 
campaign. If she only claims that 
she wants a more gradual change in 
wages, voters cannot be sure that she 
would actually sign off on a $15 mini-
mum wage bill if it was presented to 
her.
Another issue is that many peo-
ple do not believe that incremental 
change will bene?t them more than 
a doubling of the federal minimum 
wage, from the current $7.25 to 
$15. Clinton reasons that in rural 
areas, doubling wages would have 
suboptimal effects on the economy 
and could lead to fewer jobs. It is not 
certain this will occur, but Clinton 
believes that the safe approach is to 
monitor gradual increases to make 
sure that the economy as a whole does 
not suffer.
Nevertheless, much economic re-
search has shown that increasing wag-
es would not cause a signi?cant de-
cline in the number of jobs. Last year, 
the Congressional Budget Of?ce pub-
lished a report ?nding that increasing 
wages would give higher earnings to 
at least 16.5 million workers. Accord-
ing to Statista, there are currently 144 
million people in the U.S. workforce, 
so around 10 percent of the workers 
with low wages would bene?t. 
Regardless of whether increasing 
wages will affect job growth, Clinton 
should be more clear about her intent, 
since many perceive that she has been 
unclear at times.

With the end of the year fast approaching, The Tartan’s thoughts are skipping ahead to break. So we asked,
What are you excited about this summer?
Compiled by Sinead Foley and Joshua BrownTARTANS TALK

Few people can deny that this has 
been one of the most interesting and 
confusing election seasons in recent 
history. Anti-establishment rhetoric 
is ?nding a larger audience than ever 
before in both parties. While Bernie 
Sanders rails against Wall Street on 
the left, Donald Trump engages in 
open rebellion and threatens violence 
against the political elite on the right.
This puts Paul Ryan, Speaker of the 
House and effective leader of the Re-
publican Party, in a very dif?cult posi-
tion. In a campaign so dominated by 
anti-establishment sentiment, Ryan 
happens to be the most prominent 
face of the establishment. Consider-
ing the target that this paints on his 
back, he has conducted himself with 
dignity and poise. If there’s anything 
that the past year has demonstrated, 
it’s that Ryan has one of the sharpest 
political minds in the country. He has 
demonstrated an uncanny ability to 
smoothly maneuver through ugly sit-
uations and shape the conversation in 
such a way that he might just emerge 
from this mess stronger than he was 
going in.
Consider how Ryan got the job. 
Late last year, John Boehner abruptly 
announced his resignation and de-
cision to step down within the next 
month. Boehner’s pick, Kevin Mc-
Carthy, was seen as the successor 
and received wide support, includ-
ing from Ryan himself. When Mc-
Carthy abruptly withdrew his name 
from consideration, the attention fell 
on Ryan. Initially, he refused as well. 
It was only after a multitude of en-
dorsements from across the Repub-
lican spectrum, including the ever-
rebellious Freedom Caucus, that Ryan 
reconsidered and took the job. He 
managed to land the most respected 
position in the establishment, without 
any sort of campaign, all while man-
aging to paint himself as the reluctant 
white knight.
As Speaker, Ryan has been brazen-
ly assertive this election season, even 
going so far as to directly rebuke his 
own party’s candidates. When Trump 
suggested a blanket ban on Muslims 
entering America, Ryan didn’t mince 
his words — he made it clear that 
such ideas weren’t what the Republi-
can Party, or conservatism in general, 
stood for. Later in the campaign, when 
Trump failed to disavow an endorse-
ment from Ku Klux Klan leader David 
Duke, Ryan went so far as to say that 
Trump would not be the Republican 
nominee if he didn’t unequivocally re-
ject the bigotry and racism that Duke 
stood for. Such standoffs have cre-
ated a sharp line in the sand between 
Trump and Ryan.
Never in the modern era has there 
existed such animosity between a 
party leader and the party’s front run-
ner this late in the primaries. If Trump 
successfully gets to 1,237 delegates, 
he will be the Republican nominee for 
President. How would he approach 
not being supported by the party 
leader? One can never be sure with 
Trump, but if his statements are to be 
taken at face value — very confronta-
tionally. How would Ryan approach 
a situation like this? He’d like us to 
believe that he would support the 
nominee, even if that happened to be 
Trump. That said, make no mistake, 
Ryan will do everything in his power 
to prevent Trump from getting the 
nomination.
What Ryan is probably hoping for, 
and what seems increasingly likely, is 
that Trump falls just short of secur-
ing 1,237 delegates. In this scenario, 
Ryan becomes surprisingly power-
ful and his options become far more 
interesting. The ensuing brokered 
convention would essentially allow 
the party elders, led by Ryan, to play 
kingmakers and choose the next Re-
publican presidential nominee. Given 
this choice, Ryan would likely make 
sure that anyone but Trump gets the 
nomination; a Trump candidacy is so 
polarizing that the general election 
would be lost at the starting line. Fur-
ther, making Trump the spokesman of 
the party alienates everyone besides 
his core base away from the GOP for 
a generation.
What does Trump do in a situation 
like this? Nobody expects him to go 
quietly into the night. He might either 
try and sabotage the campaign of the 
chosen Republican nominee or, more 
likely, launch a third party bid for 
President. Trump supporters aren’t 
the traditional Republican voter base 
— some of his positions, such as those 
on trade and healthcare, are decid-
edly un-Republican. In a theoretical 
three-way general election, Trump’s 
votes could eat into both Democrat 
and Republican shares. 
This would result in a very inter-
esting and potentially disastrous gen-
eral election if no party gets a majori-
ty. Although Ryan wouldn’t want this, 
his bigger priorities are in the more 
distant future.
In any situation where Trump 
doesn’t get to 1,237 delegates, the 
chosen Republican nominee would 
enjoy a small to negligible chance of 
winning a general election. Going up 
against Trump and Hillary Clinton in 
a brutal three person race is also likely 
to end the political career of whoever 
takes up that mantle. Keeping that in 
mind, Ryan has just the candidate he’d 
want for the nominee — Ted Cruz. He 
is a ?rm second to Trump in the pri-
maries, making him a legitimate con-
tender that doesn’t have to be para-
chuted in at the last minute. He also 
happens to be a subject of derision for 
the establishment. Republican sena-
tor Lindsey Graham once joked that if 
you killed Ted Cruz on the ?oor and 
the trial was in the Senate, nobody 
would convict you. The vast major-
ity of the Republican establishment 
wouldn’t be too sad to see Cruz go. 
With Cruz gone and a good four years 
till the next presidential nominee, 
Ryan suddenly has breathing room to 
shape the party in his image as its sole 
remaining strong leader.
A surprising amount of ink has 
been spilled on speculation that Ryan 
might attempt to engineer a situation 
where he himself becomes the nomi-
nee. He has repeatedly, in increasingly 
strong language, denied any interest 
in being the nominee. And yet, fairly 
enough, people point to how he rose 
to become the Speaker of the House 
as evidence of the trustworthiness 
of his denials. His predecessor, John 
Boehner, has openly called for him to 
be given the nomination. 
Yet, this time, it’d be very surpris-
ing if he tried the same reluctant ac-
ceptance tactic that worked so beau-
tifully last year. Simply put, being the 
Republican nominee in this election 
is political suicide, and Ryan under-
stands this. He lacks the support of 
the base. He’d be ripped to shreds by 
Clinton and Trump. In a campaign 
so dominated by anti-establishment 
rhetoric, how can he expect the people 
to accept the Speaker of the House?
Paul Ryan is not running for Presi-
dent. He has, for all intents and pur-
poses, written off the 2016 election 
for the GOP. That said, he is running 
a campaign — a campaign that likely 
leads to his emerging as the only re-
maining strong voice within the GOP 
with the ability to “save” his party 
from extremists like Trump.

Recently, in light of the deaths of 
two students, our campus decided 
to reopen the discussion of mental 
health and stress culture at Carnegie 
Mellon. Unfortunately, our campus 
has the memory of a gold?sh, and 
one aspect that remains under-dis-
cussed is the fact that some of us take 
our stress out with alcohol and other 
drugs.
Carnegie Mellon has an alcohol 
problem. This may seem surprising 
to most people as we are supposedly 
stereotyped as a campus of anti-social 
nerds living in Gates. This, evidently, 
is not true. In terms of undergradu-
ates who do participate in the drink-
ing culture here (around two-thirds, 
as speci?ed in the 2014 Healthy U 
Survey), we are in line with the na-
tional average. Carnegie Mellon does 
have the normal college drinking ex-
perience. However, students don’t 
feel validated in this, which adds to 
the problem — in order to convince 
ourselves that we do party here, we 
go too hard.
It was also reported in the 2014 
Healthy U survey that 19 percent of 
undergraduates and 17 percent of 
graduate students reported drinking 
to relieve stress. This number may 
seem small, but it’s still a good num-
ber of students who use alcohol to 
deal with stress. It’s not that our drug 
and alcohol behavior is abnormal, it 
just has an extra layer — while most 
college students can take a breath 
and enjoy their life soberly, here stu-
dents go from working to drinking 
and back and forth, without a break 
to just breathe. Had three exams this 
week? Get wasted the second you get 
done. That one notoriously hard CS 
class? Work till 11 p.m. and get drunk 
afterwards. Repeat every weekend. 
The reality is we don’t leave time for 
sober interaction without drinking 
and without studying. This creates an 
environment where we take out the 
worst things that have happened to us 
in the worst ways possible, leaving this 
unhealthy culture, eventually causing 
some people to have dependencies.
Then there’s Carnival. We all love 
Carnival, as it is sadly the one time a 
year everyone on this campus seems to 
drop all responsibilities and leave the 
libraries, which turns into a drinking 
fest at the end of day. When do we get 
a break? When do we get to breathe 
without being drunk? What’s even 
worse is that I’ve even heard some 
instances of people having homework 
due over Carnival, just adding to this 
stressed-get-drunk culture. The fact 
that Carnival is marketed as the only 
time that we behave like a normal 
campus means that how we behave 
during it says a lot. Because it’s the 
“only” time it can end up in disaster, 
as students once again push their lim-
its a bit too hard.
This stress-drinking culture, in ad-
dition to our need to feel validated 
in our party culture here, also stems 
from the fact that there is this image 
of the ideal Carnegie Mellon student 
who works hard in their respective 
STEM ?eld, has a decent social life, 
does well in school, is involved in 
leadership positions, and on top of 
all of this gets at least seven hours of 
sleep. But is this possible? The motto 
of Carnegie Mellon is to put “our 
heart in the work,” but where do you 
get time to be yourself when you are 
in the work and then just get drunk?
We are expected to live up to this 
ideal standard of human, and put our 
hearts and souls into the work. But the 
reality is that doesn’t actually make 
for a well-balanced human being; we 
put our hearts into the work before we 
put our hearts into ourselves. That’s 
messed up because that’s when we 
de?ne ourselves by our accomplish-
ments and grades rather that just ex-
isting and valuing our own existence. 
Putting our heart into the work is es-
sentially a capitalist idea, that we try 
to humanize and make apply to us. 
The idea that we are our work, and 
our grades are accomplishments, 
is one of the largest contributors to 
stress culture here at Carnegie Mel-
lon, and if we don’t live up to that we 
crash. On top of all of that, some of us 
crash into drinking, drugs, and harder 
drugs until we can escape everything 
that is our work, which makes up who 
we are, and results in the culture we 
have right now.
So I propose this: let’s put our 
hearts in ourselves before our work. 
Self care, which is a very simple con-
cept that seems to escape people 
(especially with ?nals upcoming) is 
necessary. 
If you’re constantly going from 
working to drinking there is not time 
for you to breathe or to be who you 
are. Human beings are much more 
and greater than the work they do — 
and however much we say otherwise, 
so are the students here.

“Boots on the ground” a good decision in ?ght against ISIS 
Carnegie Mellon students lose their hearts and sanity to work
Sandra Kang/Staff Artist
ZEKE ROSENBERG
On Monday, Secretary of De-
fense Ash Carter announced that the 
United States will be sending 217 
ground troops to battle ISIS in Iraq. 
The ground troops will be joining the 
special operations forces that arrived 
in October.
Evaluating whether or not this is a 
good idea is a very complicated pro-
cess, but there are three basic things 
that need to be true for a ground in-
vasion to be a good idea. There needs 
to be some sort of value, strategic 
or otherwise, that justi?es the loss 
of life in pursuit of a goal; It must 
be likely that the ground troops will 
make victory substantially easier; 
and there must be a viable exit strat-
egy. In this particular case, all these 
requirements are met. While there 
are a thousand moving parts to a 
complete evaluation of the decision 
to send ground troops to Iraq, this 
very basic checklist (which has been 
ignored before) would lead you to 
approve the decision by Carter.
The ?rst and most obvious litmus 
test of whether or not to send ground 
troops is whether or not it is worth the 
loss of life. Since this is a value judg-
ment, it is the part of warfare subject 
to public political discourse and the 
one that is hardest to evaluate.
Given recent history, this litmus 
test is also commonly used to reject 
any military action. People felt that 
the Iraq War from 2003-2007 was 
completely without purpose. While 
this isn’t an accurate representation, 
the Iraq War turned out to be a colos-
sal strategic blunder in hindsight.
Former president George W. Bush 
was under the impression that Iraq 
was developing weapons of mass 
destruction (WMDs) from both an 
imfamous National Intelligence Es-
timate report and statements from 
former Iraqi president Saddam Hus-
sein. Bush himself was not privy to 
just how porous the case made in 
that intelligence brie?ng was. The 
rest is history. The United States mili-
tary toppled the Iraqi government, 
removing a primary enemy from 
the radars of both Al Qaida in Iraq 
(now ISIS) and Iran and achieving 
virtually nothing. Presently, eastern 
Iraq is doing okay, but western Iraq 
is controlled by ISIS, hardly a prefer-
able alternative to Hussein. No evi-
dence of WMDs was found.
This experience leads many peo-
ple to be strongly averse to a renewed 
ground campaign in Iraq. They see 
no positive incentive for military en-
gagement or doubt the veracity of 
any justi?cation given. However, in 
this case, there are clear and impact-
ful reasons for the United States to be 
?ghting to destroy ISIS.
The ?rst is a moral argument. Peo-
ple across the Middle East are dying 
due to the brutality of ISIS. There is 
even an argument that strategic blun-
ders by the United States led to the 
rise of ISIS, which makes us respon-
sible. From there, it seems suf?cient 
that ISIS must be destroyed or they 
will continue to kill people in stag-
gering numbers.
Second, ISIS is having noticeably 
negative effects on the American 
economy. The devastating effect on 
the economy of the Levant from the 
death of people who could otherwise 
be positive contributors and the ef-
fects of globalization mean that this 
is a signi?cant problem for America 
as well. Furthermore, ISIS’s illegal 
oil sales are helping to drive down 
the cost of oil which is damaging the 
American economy in ways ranging 
from the stock market to Medicare.
Third, a stable Iraq is an important 
goal, and ISIS makes it impossible for 
Iraq to be stable since the group’s 
primary goal is to occupy Iraqi land. 
A stable Iraq could help counterbal-
ance Iran’s military ambition, as 
it did before the Iraq War. This, in 
addition to Obama’s Iran Deal, could 
help stabilize the Middle East in the 
long run by laying the groundwork 
for peaceful diplomatic negotiations 
when the region’s powers are less 
trigger-happy.
The second benchmark in pursu-
ing a con?ict is whether or not the 
con?ict can be won. It seems easy to 
just say America has the most power-
ful military in the world and will win 
everything, but that is a silly mistake 
to make. History is littered with over-
con?dent powers taking ill-advised 
steps into con?icts they never had 
a chance at winning. American sol-
diers had no knowledge of Vietnam-
ese jungles and could not get into 
pitched battles with the Viet Cong, 
making the Americans susceptible 
to ambushes and making strategic 
gains incredibly hard. America also 
has trouble in rural, mountainous 
regions like Afghanistan because it 
is hard to train soldiers for that ter-
rain in America. This is why the war 
in Afghanistan yielded nothing for so 
long; the American military was ill-
equipped for the con?ict and had no 
reasonable expectation of victory.
This con?ict is different. ISIS 
is present mostly in or near cities, 
which provides several avenues 
for ground troops to help the U.S. 
achieve victory.
The ?rst way U.S. ground troops 
have an advantage is that since cities 
are concentrated, they are easier to 
police and patrol, making it easier for 
forces to ?ght there.
The second is that America has 
had the world’s best military night 
vision for a very long time. This may 
seem like a silly advantage for the 
world’s most well-funded ?ghting 
force, but seeing in the dark means 
there are fewer temporal boundaries 
to Americans ?ghting. Cities are busy 
during the day, allowing for tactical 
operations to happen in secret, while 
battles can occur at night. When they 
happen, American soldiers will have 
a signi?cant edge in battle.
The third is that ISIS is largely 
made up of foreign ?ghters, making 
it dif?cult for the group to ?ght in ru-
ral areas they are less familiar with. 
Fighting against ISIS in the Middle 
East gives the Americans quite a few 
local allies. This means they can form 
a coalition similar to the Chindits, a 
coalition of Burmese, Nepalese, and 
British troops that fought in Burma 
during World War II. Japanese sol-
diers, who were largely con?ned 
to cities and the pathways between 
them, could not protect their supply 
lines as they moved from city to city 
when attacked by the coalition. They 
were eventually forced to abandon 
Burma entirely despite their initial 
campaign being one of the most suc-
cessful invasions by any power dur-
ing World War II. ISIS is con?ned in 
the same way the Japanese soldiers 
were and they are much worse in 
terms of training and equipment. 
Adding American equipment and 
the ability to call in air strikes to skir-
mishes between cities could choke 
off ISIS’s ability to get goods to its 
military bases, quickly cutting off any 
ability to ?ght.
The fourth is that airstrikes be-
come much more effective when 
there are military personnel on the 
ground. Soldiers on the ground can 
learn local customs and more easily 
tell civilian gatherings from ISIS 
meetings. When airstrikes hit things 
like parties and weddings, it right-
fully makes people angry towards 
the West and more willing to join 
ISIS or other similar groups. Having 
someone who knows the cultural dif-
ferences call in the attack is a much 
more effective way to be attacking 
from the air.
Finally, before embarking on a 
ground invasion there must be a way 
to exit the war so that Americans are 
not paying for this for decades like we 
do with con?icts such as the Korean 
War or the Afghan War. It seems the 
Obama administration thought of 
this problem months in advance. The 
special operations forces have been 
training local police groups, which 
shows in Iraq’s ability to hold Tikrit 
and Ramadi, two cities that were 
once held by ISIS, largely on their 
own. These cities now experience rel-
ative peace due to the Iraqi govern-
ment’s ability to keep them secure. If 
the 217 soldiers are gearing up to take 
a larger ISIS-held city such as Mosul, 
the largest city by population in west-
ern Iraq before the con?ict, the train-
ing operations by special forces could 
make it so that Iraqi forces could hold 
Mosul, and America could move to 
a different objective instead of hold-
ing the city forever. This would allow 
America to systematically shrink ISIS 
territory until local forces could ?n-
ish it off without having to act as a co-
lonial power, giving America the abil-
ity to exit in the short term instead of 
the very long term.
Even with all of the death and de-
struction ISIS causes, it is important 
to be careful in our response. By send-
ing a small team, the Department of 
Defense has made it clear that these 
soldiers have a speci?c objective and 
the groundwork is laid for this to be 
a successful intervention. There are 
plenty of other factors such as strat-
egy and the situation on the ground 
that can be impossible to know with-
out the right security clearances, but 
it seems the Obama administration is 
not playing tiddlywinks with ISIS as 
the Republicans might have you be-
lieve. Instead, Obama has very delib-
erately made his moves and has put 
the U.S. in a position to defeat ISIS 
with minimal long term damage.

Men’s Tennis
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
tennis team ?ew south on Sat-
urday to play in the Univer-
sity Athletic Association (UAA) 
championships in Altamonte 
Springs, Florida. Ninth-ranked 
Carnegie Mellon took on ?fth-
ranked University of Chicago 
in an intense back and forth 
match that ended with Carne-
gie Mellon winning 5–4, giving 
them a third place ?nish in the 
championship.
Despite their eventual vic-
tory, the Tartans found them-
selves with a de?cit after 
doubles play. The Tartans only 
managed to earn one of three 
possible points from doubles 
play, coming from the duo 
of ?rst-year students Vayum 
Arora and Daniel Levine. 
The pair won their set 8–6 
in the ?rst position, and the 
Tartans moved into singles play 
down 2–1. The Tartans were 
forced to make a comeback in 
singles play if they wanted to 
win, and they did. After drop-
ping another point and fall-
ing even further to 3–1, senior 
Abhishek Alla stepped up and 
got the Tartans rolling again in 
?rst singles. Alla won 6–3, 6–2 
and rekindled the ?re that the 
Tartans had for victory. First-
year Chaz Downing evened 
out the score for the Tartans at 
3–3; winning third singles 6–4, 
6–4. Arora followed Downing’s 
lead, but he had a much great-
er challenge. After a long, 
grueling set, Arora won 7–5, 
6–2 in ?fth singles to give the 
Tartans the lead. Chicago won 
fourth singles to even the score 
once again, but Levine would 
not give the victory away. He 
earned the ?nal game–winning 
point in three sets, scoring 6–4, 
2–6, 6–1.
The third place victory near-
ly guarantees the Tartans  a 
place in the National Collegiate 
Athletics Association (NCAA) 
tournament because ?ve of 
the nation’s top ten teams are 
a part of the UAA and Carnegie 
Mellon is third in that group. 
The bids for that tournament 
are released on May 9 and the 
tournament takes place May 
12–15. The Tartans are 16–6 
on the year.
Women’s Tennis
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s tennis team competed in 
the University Athletic Asso-
ciation (UAA) championships 
on Sunday. Carnegie Mellon 
faced off against the University 
of Chicago and fell 6–3, earn-
ing them a fourth place ?nish 
in the tournament. The loss 
moves the ninth–ranked Tar-
tans to a 15–7 record on the 
season.
Doubles play was intense, 
and many of the sets were back 
and forth with no clear winner 
until the very end. However, 
Carnegie Mellon could not 
seem to ?nish a set strongly 
and ended up dropping all 
three doubles matches with a 
score of 8–6.
The Tartans did however 
manage to earn some consola-
tion points in singles, though. 
Sophomore Cori Sidell won 
third singles 5–7, 6–2, 10–3. 
Right behind her was ?rst-
year Jamie Vizelman, taking 
fourth singles 5–7, 6–4, 10–2. 
The ?nal point for the Tartans 
came from ?rst–year Mariana 
Selenica in ?fth singles, win-
ning 7–6 (8–6), 6–3.
The Tartans must now wait 
to ?nd out if they have been 
selected to compete in the up-
coming National Collegiate 
Athletics Association (NCAA) 
tournament. The bids are re-
leased on May 9, and the tour-
nament begins on May 12.
Track and Field
The Carnegie Mellon track 
and ?eld teams competed in 
the University Athletic Asso-
ciation (UAA) championships 
on Sunday. The men’s team 
scored a total of 137 points and 
took second place overall in the 
competition. 
Sophomore Jacob Schofel 
won the hammer toss with 
a distance of 49.38 meters. 
Along with Schofel, ?rst-year 
Rai Walters was crowned a 
UAA champion by jumping 
6.28 meters in the long jump 
event, a season best for him. 
Schofel also threw the discus 
a distance of 42.46 meters to 
place third in the event.
Juniors Don Boyer and 
Owen Norley, along with senior 
Marc-Daniel Julien posted ca-
reer best times in the 110-me-
ter hurdles, the 1,500-meter 
run and the 800-meter run 
respectively.
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s track team placed ?fth 
in the UAA championships, 
and posted two ?rst place ?n-
ishes along with three school 
records. 
First-year Tessa Allen broke 
the school record for the high 
jump, clearing 1.6 meters. Ju-
nior Grace Yee broke the school 
record for pole vaulting that 
she set herself last year, vault-
ing over a bar set at 3.51 meters 
to win the event. Sophomore 
Sarah Cook also broke a school 
record, running the 400-meter 
dash with a time of 56.67 sec-
onds, taking fourth place in the 
event.
The track and ?eld teams 
will head to Allegheny College 
in Meadville, Pennsylvania on 
May 13 at 10 a.m. to compete 
in the Gator Invitational.

Kevin Durant is not a champion yet, but he’s near the top
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Senior Staff
Monday night saw the 
Dallas Mavericks slip by 
with an 85-84 victory over 
the Oklahoma City Thunder 
to steal the home court ad-
vantage for the series. The 
Thunder promptly regained 
their home court advantage 
with a win on Thursday, but 
it did little to calm an increas-
ingly prominent narrative 
that Thunder forward Kevin 
Durant is a choker.
The narrative began after 
the Thunder were stomped 
on in the 2012 National 
Basketball Association (NBA) 
?nals by the Miami Heat. The 
Thunder have found little suc-
cess in the postseasons since 
then.
In 2013, Thunder point 
guard Russell Westbrook suf-
fered a knee injury during the 
?rst round of the playoffs and, 
despite still having Durant 
and forward Serge Ibaka, the 
Thunder were barely able to 
handle the Houston Rockets, 
a mediocre eight seed, before 
being mercifully dispatched 
by the Memphis Grizzlies in 
?ve games.
In 2014, the Thunder got 
pushed to the brink in round 
one by a Memphis team that 
was signi?cantly worse than 
they were the year before due 
to personnel changes and in-
juries. This series prompted 
an infamous headline from 
The Daily Oklahoman call-
ing Durant “Mr. Unreliable.” 
The Thunder then beat the 
Clippers after a very contro-
versial series of calls changed 
the outcome of one of the 
games in that series. 
The Thunder were then  
overmatched by the eventual 
champion Spurs, who beat 
them by 25 or more points on 
two different occasions.
After Westbrook and 
Durant both spent time out 
of action last season, the 
Thunder missed the 2015 
playoffs entirely.
The Thunder have continu-
ously blown large third quar-
ter leads this season as well.
These playoff failures and 
Durant’s  time in the NBA with-
out a title play a signi?cant 
role in the star player’s legacy 
for many fans. The scene from 
Monday night’s game — fea-
turing Durant badly missing 
two three-point shots while 
the Thunder were down four 
points, before missing a game 
winning layup in heavy traf?c 
— did not help Durant satisfy 
his detractors.
However, this reputation 
is unfair. In between those 
two plays, Durant hit a three-
pointer that brought the 
Thunder within one point and 
put them in a position where 
they could have won the 
game. The layup he missed at 
the end went through two dif-
ferent Mavericks and would 
have been nearly impossible 
to score.
His previous performances 
during the season and in the 
playoffs show that Durant 
performs well in high leverage 
situations.
It’s hard to remember 
now that the Thunder have 
been consistent contenders in 
the Western Conference for 
so long, but Durant’s amaz-
ing performance in the 2010 
playoffs snagged an upstart, 
young Thunder team two wins 
against a juggernaut iteration 
of the Los Angeles Lakers that 
steamrolled their way to a title 
after the Thunder gave them 
?ts by defeating them.
The 2012 trip to the Finals 
saw the Thunder overpower 
three good teams, includ-
ing a Spurs team that won 75 
percent of its regular season 
games. The talk of these play-
offs was that Westbrook was 
hurting the team with poor 
decision making and Durant 
had saved them.
The 2014 Clippers were a 
very good team and, even if 
the game with controversial 
calls was overturned, it would 
have forced a game seven 
in that playoff series. The 
Thunder still won three games 
very convincingly. Durant not 
only made his usual immense 
scoring contributions, but he 
also had some notable defen-
sive games that helped the 
Thunder come out on top.
Durant may not have won 
an NBA title yet, but that’s 
not a fair way to judge an in-
dividual’s legacy. Durant has 
seen bad personnel decisions 
hurt his teams while he consis-
tently sees juggernauts on the 
other side of the court.
The infamous James 
Harden trade that saw the 
shooting guard move from the 
Thunder to the Rockets for a 
number of players who were 
never nearly as good, had little 
?nancial justi?cation, and per-
manently damaged the Thun-
der’s trajectory by jettisoning 
a legitimate star. The Thunder 
consistently surround their 
stars with subpar players like 
shooting guards Dion Waiters 
and Andre Roberson. It’s hard 
to win basketball games when 
the whole team is lacking in 
performance on the court.
Further, the Thunder have 
had incredibly bad luck with 
the rest of the league. Their 
?rst ?nals appearance came 
against a Miami Heat team 
that featured the best player 
in the world, forward LeBron 
James, and two other super-
stars. The Spurs machine 
won a title in 2014 and no one 
was particularly competitive 
with them. The Golden State 
Warriors just won the most 
games in a single season by 
a team in the history of the 
league after FiveThirtyEight 
ranked last season’s version as 
the fourth-best team ever by 
one measure. 
The Thunder, meanwhile, 
seem to sustain injuries to 
key players consistently and 
because of this have trouble 
maintaining year-to-year con-
sistency with rotations.
The “choker” narrative 
has followed just about every 
great player in history until 
they win. James was labeled a 
choke until he won two ?nals. 
Former Bulls shooting guard 
Michael Jordan was consid-
ered a choke until he won 
separate three-peats later in 
his career. 
So were former 
Philadelphia 76ers, Phoenix 
Suns and Rockets forward 
Charles Barkley and for-
mer Philadelphia Warriors, 
76ers, and Lakers center Wilt 
Chamberlain despite being 
some of the greatest players 
to ever play their positions. 
It’s an attempt to try to add 
human features to superhu-
man feats and it only serves 
to tarnish legacies of people 
who were nothing short of 
extraordinary.
Despite missing most of last 
year due to injury, Durant has 
spent every other year being 
an undisputed top three player 
in the league. Durant may not 
have an NBA Finals victory, 
and he may never have one, 
but he’s consistently among 
the league’s best players and 
has been since he was drafted 
by the Seattle Supersonics in 
2007. 
It’s silly to let incompetent 
management and bad luck 
distract from the incredible 
things we get to see Durant do 
on a daily basis. 
League of Legends takes to international stage after LCS
NHL hockey gets heated as Stanley Cup playoffs begin
ALEX WOOD
Sports Editor
The 2016 spring split for 
League of Legends has con-
cluded, and the season is half-
way over. League of Legends is 
a video game played by teams 
of ?ve players that each con-
trols a character, known as a 
champion. These champions 
duke it out on a fantasy battle-
?eld known as Summoner’s 
Rift, using magical abilities 
and attacks to defeat their op-
ponents. The Rift has three 
lanes: bottom, middle, and top 
along with a jungle in between. 
Teams all over the world play 
this game professionally, prac-
ticing for multiple hours every 
day to hone their skills. The 
best of these teams face off in 
season-style format called the 
League Championship Series 
(LCS) to determine the best of 
the best over three months. 
 Now that the ?rst three 
months, called the spring split, 
is over, the best teams from 
each region will come togeth-
er to play in one large interna-
tional tournament, called the 
Mid-Season Invitation (MSI). 
Six teams, the spring split 
champions from each region, 
will meet at the Shanghai 
Oriental Sports Center in Chi-
na to determine the best team 
in the world at this halfway 
point in the season. While it 
is not the of?cial world cham-
pionship, MSI is seen as a use-
ful benchmark to determine 
a region’s relative strength 
going into the summer split. 
The tournament consists of a 
group stage in a double round-
robin format, where four of 
the six teams will advance into 
the bracket stage. The bracket 
stage is single elimination, and 
each match is a best-of-?ve 
series.
The competition at this 
year’s MSI will be ?erce. 
South Korea’s representative, 
SK Telecom T1 (better known 
simply as SKT), has won the 
world championship twice 
in the last three years and is 
considered the heavy favorite 
to win the tournament. Their 
star mid laner, Lee “Faker” 
Sang-hyeok is the captain of 
the team and is considered 
the best player to ever play 
League of Legends — some 
call him the god of gods when 
it comes to the game. His only 
loss at an international tour-
nament came at last year’s 
MSI, where Chinese team Ed-
ward Gaming (EDG) drafted 
a team composition designed 
to completely counter Faker 
and nothing else. It worked 
and SKT lost their ?rst inter-
national event, but it seems 
that only made Faker angry. 
Although EDG did not qualify 
for this year’s MSI, Faker and 
SKT will surely be back with a 
?ery vengeance.
The most heated matchup 
will be between the North 
American and European 
teams, because the League 
of Legends community loves 
the rivalry across the pond. 
Europe’s G2 Esports is a new 
team, entering the LCS at the 
beginning of this split. They 
took no time to establish their 
dominance, however. Behind 
the prodigal performance 
of mid laner Luka “Perkz” 
Perkovic and the consistent 
play of support Glenn “Hybrid” 
Doornenbal, G2 took the Euro-
pean LCS by storm and easily 
took the spring split champi-
onship over the defenders, 
FNATIC. The North American 
LCS is represented by Counter 
Logic Gaming (CLG), a 
well-established organization 
that has competed for a top 
spot in North America since 
its inception, and was at one 
point considered the best team 
in the world. CLG has under-
gone some major changes in 
recent months, however. They 
lost their star carry player to 
rival Team SoloMid, who has 
battled with CLG every year for 
the top spot in North America. 
That didn’t faze CLG though, 
because they rode the veteran 
leadership of support player 
Zaqueri “Aphromoo” Black 
all the way to the spring split 
championship. Aphromoo 
took a rookie from the lower 
levels of play, brought him into 
the LCS and has helped turn 
him into one of the best carry 
players in North America. That 
player, Trevor “Stixxay” Hayes, 
won the MVP award for the 
spring split ?nals against TSM 
and has shown just how ef-
fective a good teacher can be 
in this game. The Taiwanese 
Flash Wolves and the Chinese 
team Royal Never Give Up are 
also set to provide challenges 
for the top teams, but there 
is no clear favorite among 
the non-Korean regions. This 
year’s MSI will prove to be an 
exciting one. The competition 
takes place from May 4 to May 
15 and can be watched online 
at na.lolesports.com. Will we 
see SKT dominate as expected, 
or will a dark horse emerge to 
take down the Goliath? Tune 
in to ?nd out.

Sports Editor
There exists only one major 
professional sport that ac-
cepts physical brawling as a 
valid way to settle a dispute: 
ice hockey. Some consider it 
a barbaric and outdated way 
of problem solving, but ?ght-
ing has de?nitely given hockey 
the identity of one of the most 
brutal and physically enduring 
sports in the world. Hockey 
teams in the United States and 
Canada spend the winter and 
spring facing off against each 
other in a season style format, 
where wins earn points toward 
a team’s seeding in the post-
season playoffs. The National 
Hockey League (NHL) playoffs 
are the pinnacle of competi-
tion in ice hockey. 16 teams are 
admitted to the playoffs, and 
they play in a best-of-seven 
series format to determine the 
winner of each matchup. The 
ultimate reward is the Stanley 
Cup, a massive trophy that has 
the names of winning players 
and coaches engraved into its 
chalice. This is the epitome of 
accomplishments in ice hock-
ey, next to winning the gold 
medal in the Olympics.
This year’s Stanley Cup 
playoffs have already proven 
to be unusual, even after just 
one round of play. For just the 
second time in NHL history, 
none of the seven Canadian 
teams quali?ed for the post-
season. Also, both Florida-
based teams made the Stanley 
Cup playoffs for only the sec-
ond time ever. While these 
are both unusual situations, 
there are some staple teams 
that have maintained their 
spot as consistent postseason 
contenders. The Detroit Red 
Wings have quali?ed for the 
playoffs for 25 consecutive 
years, although they’ve been 
knocked out already in the 
?rst round by the Tampa Bay 
Lightning. Also, each of the 
three California-based teams 
have made the playoffs in the 
same season for the fourth 
time in six years. Unusual con-
tenders like the Tampa Bay 
Lightning and the Florida Pan-
thers are sure to shake things 
up in the Stanley Cup playoffs 
this year.
The NHL is divided into 
two conferences, the east 
and the west. Each confer-
ence brings eight teams to 
the playoffs, two of which are 
wild card teams that had to 
play matches to ?ght for their 
spot in the tournament. In 
the eastern conference, the 
Washington Capitals look like 
the team to beat after winning 
the conference championship 
for the regular season. The 
Capitals’ star forward Evgeny 
Kuznetsov along with veteran 
winger and captain Alexander 
Ovechkin are sure to put up a 
formidable challenge for any 
team looking to make a run 
for the Stanley Cup. With the 
Red Wings knocked out, the 
Pittsburgh Penguins and each 
of the Florida teams are look-
ing right at Washington to see 
if they will slip up. 
Pittsburgh will look to 
young superstar Sidney 
Crosby along with seasoned 
goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury 
to try and sti?e their oppo-
nents. Fleury will not have an 
easy job against the explosive 
offenses of the Florida teams. 
The Lightning’s dynamic trio 
of Nikita Kucherov, Steven 
Stamkos, and Victor Hedman 
have been picking apart de-
fenses all season and they’ll 
look to do the same against 
their next opponent.
The western conference 
has less obvious favorites. The 
Dallas Stars are the immediate 
contenders to make the ?nals 
because they won the western 
conference championship for 
the regular season. The Stars 
are led by captain and for-
ward Jamie Benn, who poses 
a massive offensive threat to 
any team looking to get past 
the ?rst seed in the west. The 
Anaheim Ducks are the Stars’ 
biggest challenge, and as 
champions of the Paci?c di-
vision in the western confer-
ence, they’re hungry for more.  
Winger Corey Perry and for-
ward Andrew Cogliano will 
spearhead the offense for the 
Ducks, and their experience 
will make for some interesting 
games.
No matter what team you’re 
rooting for, or even if you’re 
not rooting for a team, the 
2016 Stanley Cup playoffs will 
undoubtedly be one the most 
intense sporting events of the 
year. The games can be seen 
on major sports networks, and 
the fourth and ?nal round will 
be held in early June. These 
modern-day gladiators are 
going to pour their hearts out 
onto the ice for their teams, 
and you don’t want to miss it.

Purnell hosts The Plague in Venice
Guest-director-led comedy has stunning set and costume design
Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama is a 
playground of old styles and fresh experiments, 
and The Plague in Venice was a bit of both. 
Directed by guest Sasha Iliev, and based on a 
story by Flaminio Scalia, The Plague in Venice 
premiered on the Chosky stage this month as a 
spectacular reimagining of a 400-year-old form of 
Italian theatre. 
The Plague in Venice, a comedy about a plague 
that killed a quarter of Venice’s population in the 
late 16th century, has everything characteristic 
of Commedia dell’arte: exaggerated archetypal 
characters, improvisation, and satire on politics 
and human nature. But this background 
information, while useful in retrospect, was 
hardly necessary for me to enjoy this bizarre, yet 
wonderful, show.
The set and costume designers behind the 
scenes deserve the loudest shout-out. Everything 
in this fictionalized Venice was visually stunning, 
from dreamy wrought iron bridges over canals, 
to an enormous, black lace-bordered moon that 
really did hit my eye like a big pizza pie. Fixed 
throughout the show with few moving parts, the 
set was not complicated, but elegant.
The costumes were far more extravagant, often 
wearing the actors more than vice-versa. They 
perfectly emphasized character types like the 
Alchemist, with his galoshes and large clusters 
of boils, the greedy Pantalone, with his gold-
trimmed hammer pants, and the Lover, with a 
tulip-bud skirt reminiscent of a particular part of 
the female anatomy. 
The play’s two most threateningly named 
characters — Plague and Death — got two of 
the coolest outfits. Plague, played by senior 
drama major Caroline Pluta, was queenly in her 
hot lava-like flowing body suit, while Death, 
played by junior drama major Clay Singer, was 
more towering puppet than costume, floating 
menacingly across the stage and grasping up 
victims with its skeletal metal hands. 
Even Plague’s squad of rats was alluring, with 
fur like gossamer rags and red glowing eyes. I 
could’ve sat through two hours of The Plague in 
Venice with my hearing turned off, and the sight 
of it alone would have conquered my attention.
Admittedly, the play packed more of a visual 
than a comedic punch. Its crude slapstick and 
stock cast of over-the-top characters, classic to 
a style of theatre several centuries old, is not too 
compatible with your average millennial’s ironic, 
postmodern brand of humor. The lines that won 
the most laughs were oddly placed yet refreshing 
references to the contemporary, such as the song 
lyrics each character would quote when Death 
asked for their “last words” — everything from 
“Bohemian Rhapsody” to “Highway to Hell.” 
I was also tickled by the running joke that one 
of Plague’s rats — Mickey — is a troublemaker 
with a big mouth and a high-pitched jolly laugh. 
But even if this comedy didn’t exactly put the 
audience in hysterics, I often found myself 
grinning at the sheer absurdity of the spectacle.
The spectacle would not have been nearly as 
effective without the talents of its cast. Pluta 
dominated the stage as Plague, whose poise and 
malicious delight never let the show’s premise — 
and its title — become lost in the chaos. 
Franceschina, played by senior drama 
major Kelsey Tarantino, was an interesting, 
stereotypically masculine twist on a very trope-y 
role. Instead of sighing and weeping in the 
name of love, this Lover weaponizes her own 
stench and dodges marriage to seek the amorous 
activity she really wants. 
The show’s most entertaining character was 
the Alchemist, played by senior drama major 
Colin Whitney, perhaps because he strayed most 
often into contemporary territory, fumbling with 
“spill-proof” flasks and reading off a laundry list 
of side-effects for a plague antidote that include 
erectile hyper-function. 
As an ensemble, the cast effectively highlighted 
human silliness in continuing to seek out sex 
and material wealth even during a time when 
everyone around you is literally dropping like 
flies.
It’s impossible to know how much of the 
show I saw on Friday night was improvised, 
as one of the tenets of commedia dell’arte is 
unpredictability. Paired with outstanding — and 
obviously professional — visual design, the 
show’s comparatively less polished performances 
gave off an impression of charm and balance.
The Plague in Venice wasn’t intimidating, 
despite its brilliant artistry, because the 
performers did not take themselves or the satire 
too seriously. When the bows came and the cast 
broke into a final cheerful song, I found myself 
wishing I knew the words to sing along, so we 
could better revel in the ridiculousness together.

Adele for awkward people
Hello. It’s me.
I was wondering if you 
could help me out. I mean, 
I hate to turn up out of 
the blue uninvited, but 
rumor has it that you’re 
the number one Dr. Feel 
Good in town. Deep down 
I must have always known 
that I’d have to bear my 
soul at some point, but I 
never thought that it would 
be in a reputable and 
prestigious newspaper, 
with a circulation of 
several thousand. So I 
mean it’s not a huge deal, 
but like it’s a pretty big 
deal to me, ya know? So 
like I was talking with my 
friend Madge, and she 
was telling me how my 
singing voice is exactly 
like a Sia-Adele-power-
ballad love-child, and 
I was like “Yeah, no, I 
totally see it.” And she 
was going on about how 
famous I could totally be 
if I only tried harder to let 
my life fall apart artistically 
rather than letting my life 
go to shambles and not 
capitalizing on it.
So now I’m wondering, 
right, how do I go about 
having my life artistically 
fall into shambles? Should 
I take up some kinda illicit 
behaviors like stealing 
candy or walking around 
town with my top off? I 
really don’t wanna go so 
far as to start smoking 
the crack or injecting 
the marijuanas, but like, 
I might do it if there’s no 
other option. And like 
what do I have to write 
about, ya know? I’ve got 
my family, we’re as well-
adjusted as it gets; I’ve got 
no addictions, awkward 
habits, outstanding 
warrants, or felony 
charges. So like yeah, 
what do I do? I’ve got 
the singing voice and the 
outrageous talent and the 
femme-fatal beehive down 
pat, but I don’t know how 
to go about ruining my life 
right. Help a sistah out?
Sincerely,
Amazing Damsel Exploring 
Live-ruining Escapades
Dear ADELE,
You’re correct; I do have 
much experience with 
artistically ruining my own 
life for the sake of art. I think 
it’s important to distinguish 
between art for art’s sake and 
art for fame’s sake. I think 
you’re seeking fame, and 
really that’s the one where a 
ruined life is more detrimental 
than advantageous. When 
you’re just an artist doing your 
little art thing, there’s art in 
like everything. Like the sky is 
art, and the moon is art, and 
the lint you find between your 
big and second toes is like 
hella art.
But when you’re famous, 
it’s all about the glitz and the 
glamour and the hookers 
and blow. You can ruin your 
life for fame, in which case 
you’ll be regarded as a very 
talented weirdo, or you can 
ruin your life for art’s sake 
and be worshipped by a 
small but manic group of 
art-children. In order to ruin 
your life for art, you must first 
know which genre of art you 
are willing to sacrifice for; 
consider the possibilities and 
the potential (dis)advantages 
for each genre. Only then 
will you be able to reach 
the transcendent status of 
a desolate and despairing 
artiste.
Love, 
Joshua “Feel-Good” 
Brown

[ Apeksha Atal  |  Assistant Pillbox Editor ]
As the clock on my phone creeped towards 9:30 p.m., the 13 members of The 
Originals’ team trickled into Peter-Wright-McKenna. The guys jumped around, 
humming to themselves and catching up with each other until their Artistic 
Director, senior electrical and computer engineering major Nitsan Shai, walked 
over to stand towards the middle of the ?oor.
Like clockwork, the rest of the guys, still chatty, began to form a circle around 
where Shai stood, with ?rst-year business administration major, president, 
and choreographer of The Originals, Leopoldo Galvan, signaling them to quiet 
down. As chatting turned to murmuring, which turned to hushed whispers, all 
the members turned their attention towards Shai, who took their quieting down 
as a signal to begin practice for the day, saying, “Okay guys, let’s sing.”
Earlier this month, The Originals won the semi-?nals for the Central Region 
Division at the University of Buffalo Center for the Arts, a category that includes 
38 groups from Ohio, upstate New York, Western Pennsylvania, and parts of 
Canada. Now they’ll be heading off to the Beacon Theatre in New York City for 
the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) ?nals.
“It’s such an honor to be selected for the ?nals,” Galvan said.
“Until this happened, this was literally somewhat of a dream for us,” said 
Originals member, choreographer, and senior industrial design major Gene Hua. 
“My freshman year was the ?rst time that we made the semi-?nals, and even 
that was crazy.”
As The Originals, or The O’s as they commonly say, get ready to attend the 
ICCA ?nals, their usual nine hours of practice a week are being pushed towards 
perfecting everything from vocals and choreography to synchronization and 
expressions. Leading up to the competition, each member has easily put in 
at least 100 hours of time working on their vocals — both on their own, and 
with the group. Occasionally the group goes through what they call marathon 
weekends, where they put around 10 hours into ?ne-tuning their arrangement 
in a single weekend.
“One weekend, thanks to Senate funding, we were able to travel to SoJam in 
Atlanta, where we saw tons of groups that we admire perform,” Galvan said. 
It was through their trip to SoJam that the O’s were not only able to see Lark, 
an incredible all-female a cappella group from Colorado University at Denver, 
perform, but were also able to meet their coach Erin Hackel.
“One thing that we’ve de?nitely done more of this year, which has helped us 
improve a lot, is taking feedback from other people, and Erin was a huge help in 
that respect, as were our friends and just people from different backgrounds,” 
said senior BXA mathematics and music technology major Erik Fredriksen, who 
works on arrangements for the group. “We’ve tried to keep our sets secret in the 
past, but we’ve realized that more than having a great reveal, it helps to have as 
many eyes on an arrangement as possible.”
Last Tuesday, I had the opportunity to be one of these eyes, and learn about 
some of the things that make The Originals the outstanding group that they are.

a cappella
pillbox 04.25.165
On Attire:
Dressing up is a pretty important part of any a cappella 
group, and The Originals have had a long and evolving 
relationship with a dark color palette and the mixing 
and matching of style techniques. The Original uniform 
per se, back in 1996 when the group was conceived, 
was a suit jacket, vest, and slacks with a plain shirt of 
any color. Over time, this changed to become a white 
shirt, blue jeans, black shoes, and a 3” wide “clown tie,” 
as Shai described it. In 2014, the black shirts came in, 
both the ties and the jeans got slimmer, and the color 
palette of dark blue and black was strongly established. 
“It’s a sexier look,” Shai laughed. 
This year the team is striving to embody a theme of 
innovation, and is letting the out?ts bring out the 
individuality that each member brings to the table, 
while still adhering to a color scheme that brings 
coherence to the look. “We let people experiment more 
with what they’re wearing, so that they’re comfortable 
on stage, and just give them suggestions at practice,” 
Shai said. “There are always, however, like two guys in 
blue ties, as a sort of homage to the original Originals.”
On Preparing Arrangements:
While Shai and Fredrikson are mostly responsible for 
putting the actual notes for arrangements down on 
the page, The O’s follow a very holistic method while 
putting sets together.
Around October and November, members have plenty 
of opportunities to submit songs, which are discussed 
as a group. The O’s collectively decide on what they 
like, don’t like, and slowly eliminate songs until they 
?nd songs that work well together, that have some 
individual uniqueness or ?avor, and that everyone 
enjoys.
“People won’t sound good if they don’t love what 
they’re singing,” Fredrikson said, “so we make sure 
that the set makes sense and that every member 
can get into it.” Once the songs are picked, Shai and 
Fredrikson meet with one another to pen down notes 
and host open sessions where any member can come 
and provide suggestions and contribute to the process. 
The aim of Shai and Fredrikson, in terms of putting 
these sets together, is to bring a pop appeal to their 
arrangement, while staying true to both the artists’ and 
their own artistic integrity. The end result in this case 
is a three-song masterpiece.
The set that The Originals have been working with 
for the ICCAs begins with a jazzy and infectiously 
enjoyable rendition of Nick Jonas’ “Levels.” The next 
song in the sequence is Lorde’s “Everybody Wants to 
Rule the World,” which alters the lively atmosphere to a 
much creepier, post-apocalyptic one. Finally, with the 
mood mellowed out, The O’s end with Demi Lovato’s 
soulful “Stone Cold,” for which ?rst-year musical 
theatre major Ramsey Pack took home the award for 
Outstanding Soloist at the Central Quarter?nals and the 
Central Semi?nals.
“The sign of a great arrangement is when you can 
practice it for dozens of hours and still not get sick of it, 
and I’m still not sick of ours,” Hua said, with his fellow 
members smiling and nodding in agreement.
On Choreography and Coherence:
If you went to Almost Midnight A Cappella last 
semester, then you’ll de?nitely remember the O’s 
performing Vampire Weekends’ “I Think Ur a Contra” 
and the very intricate choreography that they brought 
to the event. Well, turns out that was one of their least 
choreographed performances of the year.
“It was very experimental,” Galvan chuckled, “Basically 
the choreography was that there was no choreography 
except that when you’re singing you step and when 
you’re not you stay still.” Since then, both Galvan 
and Hua have worked hard to keep the energy from 
experimental performances such as that, but to have a 
set choreography established so that the singers can 
focus on their voices.
“We listen to these songs hundreds of times and try 
to ?gure out what we want to do with it, like with 
“Everybody Wants to Rule the World” we have Gene 
largely separated from the group, with the rest of the 
guys acting like his evil minions or something, just to 
bring out that dystopian vibe,” said Galvan.
The coherence that arose out of such a performance 
comes a lot from the familiarity the guys have with 
one another and hours and hours of practice. During 
practice, Galvan steps out of the group and watches 
the rest of the members perform, stopping them and 
readjusting wherever he sees an error, so that the ?nal 
result is polished, coordinated, and smooth.
On What’s Coming:
The Originals are planning to host a fall concert inviting 
a cappella groups that inspire them from outside 
Pittsburgh to come and perform in Rangos Ballroom 
on November 11. This will be the ?rst time that such 
an event will occur on such a grand scale at Carnegie 
Mellon. With The Nor’easters (2013 ICCA winners) and 
Voices in Your Head (2015 ICCA Runners up) already 
con?rmed, and more groups to come, this is de?nitely a 
show you don’t want to miss. 
“We’ve got new stuff coming out soon too,” Galvan 
hinted, so keep your eyes peeled.

Nina is even worse than expected
The Zoe Saldana led biopic based on singer and 
civil rights activist Nina Simone was the subject of 
controversy long before it came out. The casting of 
Saldana, speci?cally, has been regarded with derision. 
Saldana is a relatively light-skinned African-Latino 
woman. Simone was a de?antly African-American 
woman with far less delicate features. When reports 
emerged that Saldana was using dark makeup and a 
prosthetic nose to compensate for the differences, the 
chorus of criticism only intensi?ed.
Now that reviews for Nina have ?nally started rolling 
in, we know that the casting was symptomatic of 
a much larger problem — the movie is, to put it 
bluntly, really bad. The movie, currently struggling 
to hold up a comically low 3 percent rating on Rotten 
Tomatoes, meanders from act to act as it portrays a 
uni-dimensionally troubled Simone in a manner that 
borders on caricature.
Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said, “The word on this 
Nina Simone biopic has been so toxic for so long — it 
was ?lmed in 2012 but only released now — I was 
really hoping to ?nd something good in it. No luck.”
The Marvel juggernaut rolls on
As is the case with most weeks leading up to the 
summer, Marvel dominated the movie news cycle with 
a ?urry of announcements, rumors, and reviews this 
past week. First, the bad news: the Inhumans movie 
has been pulled from Marvel’s movie calendar. The 
Inhumans are a subspecies of humans that the Kree 
(an alien race) experimented on millennia ago. Now, 
when Inhumans are exposed to the “Terrigen Mist,” 
they suddenly and violently transform into powerful 
beings. 
Marvel’s reasons for pulling Inhumans are easy to 
guess — the parallels with X-Men, another Marvel 
property, are wide ranging. More than anything else 
though, the head honchos at Marvel have their hands 
full right now. New entries to the Marvel Cinematic 
Universe (MCU), from Spiderman: Homecoming, to 
Ant Man and the Wasp, give Marvel little space or 
incentive to launch another brand new franchise. 
Kevin Fiege, President of Marvel Studios, said:
“Since we made our initial phase three 
announcement, we added Spiderman, which was 
a big joyous coup for us. We added Ant Man and 
the Wasp, which was a big fun continuation of that 
story for us. Walt Disney Company has announced an 
Indiana Jones ?lm for right around that same time. So 
I think it will shuf?e off the current date [of Inhumans] 
that it’s on right now. How far down it shuf?es, I’m not 
sure yet.”
On a more positive note, Marvel’s Summer 2016 
juggernaut, Captain America: Civil War has been 
garnering rave reviews. Civil War is currently sitting 
on a 97 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the 
highest of any Marvel movie to date. This is absolutely 
incredible when one considers the monumental 
ambition of Civil War. The movie has to pack in more 
MCU characters than your average Avengers ?lm, 
build a legitimate story that splits these characters 
down the middle and sends them to war, set the 
foundations of the MCU through its critical Phase 
Three, all while being a self contained “popcorn 
movie” with enough quips and spectacular action 
set pieces to wow the average viewer. Consider 
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice as an example 
of everything that can go wrong when a movie tries to 
do too much.
A tale of two Jungle Books
If you haven’t seen the Jon Favreau directed, Disney 
produced The Jungle Book, I’d highly recommend 
checking it out. As a live action retelling of the 
animated classic, The Jungle Book blends spectacular 
visuals with the classic, virtually ?awless original 
story. In particular, the voice cast is absolutely top 
notch. Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, Idris Elba as Shere 
Khan, and Bill Murray as Baloo work together (with 
Scarlett Johannson, Lupita Nyong’o, and Neel Sethi), 
to make for a rollicking and fun retelling.
That said, if you don’t get a chance to catch this 
Jungle Book retelling, worry not! A Warner Brothers 
production, with an arguably even more impressive 
director and cast, is on the near horizon. Jungle 
Book: Origins, directed by Andy Serkis, and starring 
Benedict Cumberbatch, Christian Bale, and Cate 
Blanchett is on track to come out in early 2018.

Deadpool
Friday, April 29
8 p.m. & 11 p.m.
Deadpool is the movie adaptation of Marvel’s most unconventional superhero. Wade Wilson (played by Ryan Reynolds) is a fast-talking, potty-mouthed assas-
sin for hire who gets diagnosed with cancer. Running out of options, he undergoes an experimental treatment that gives him superhuman healing abilities and 
cures him of his cancer, but leaves him looking scarred and disfigured. Adopting the alter-ego of Deadpool, he fuels his dark, twisted sense of humor through 
his accelerated healing to become the ultimate anti-superhero: going on a merciless rampage to destroy the organization that treated him and ruined his life.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 2
Saturday, April 30
8 p.m. & 11 p.m.
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 2 is the epic conclusion to the Mockingjay saga. Panem is in the grips of a full-blown rebellion, being spearheaded by 
District 13, and fronted by Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence). Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson) has been rescued from the Capitol — brainwashed and led to 
believe that Katniss is his worst enemy. Katniss herself doesn’t entirely trust President Coin (Julianne Moore), or the other leaders of District 13, and is feeling 
manipulated. Through these circumstances, Mockingjay — Part 2 traces Katniss’s journey through to the devastating conclusion of the rebellion of Panem.

see yellow and black striped zebra longwings, orange

many other species flying around as viewers walk the
