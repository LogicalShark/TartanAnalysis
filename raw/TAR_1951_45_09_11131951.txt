CFP Seeks Elimination 
Of ‘Migration’ Problem
Following every Homecoming, with its Friday night migration 
from one fraternity house to another, the problem of whether or not 
the fraternities should have some sort of liquor control to prevent 
any unpleasant occurance arises. ?--------------------------------------------------—
None have happened so far, but 
this year the Council of Fraternity 
Presidents has decided to re-define 
the rules concerning the schedul­
ing of fraternity parties to elimi­
nate the hazard.
In the future a party, listed as 
an “open house”, will mean that 
anyone, on campus or off, Greek 
or not, is invited; but no liquor 
will be served by the house. When 
a fraternity wishes a party with 
liquor, it will be signed up as a 
“closed hpuse party”, and guests 
will be by invitation only.
The problem of control and 
elimination of unwanted guests has 
been left up to the individual
Death Takes 
J. B. Rosenhach
Math Department Head 
With CIT 30 Years
The Tartan records with regret 
the death of Professor Joseph B. 
Rosenbach, a member of the Car­
negie Institute of Technology fac­
ulty for three decades and Head of 
the Department of Mathematics.
Professor Rosenbach joined the 
Carnegie faculty in 1920, in 1946 
became assistant head and in 1950 
was made head of the Mathematics 
Department.
He held the distinction of being 
a close adviser to both day and 
evening students. He made im-

portant contributions to the Car­
negie Plan for Professional Edu­
cation, and served as secretary of 
the Basic Course Committee for 
many years. In addition, he took 
an active part in the administering 
and counseling of freshmen.
Professor Rosenbach received 
his undergraduate education at the 
Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn 
and the University of New Mexico, 
and his graduate education at the 
Universities of New Mexico, Col­
orado and Illinois.

houses, but the houses will be held 
responsible for any violations of 
the new code.
A plan is now being considered 
by the social committee of CFP to 
control the carrying of beer bot­
tles, glasses, mugs, and any other 
container between houses at any 
time. The feeling is that if drink­
ing is kept completely inside the 
houses, the conduct of the frater­
nities will be more respectable in 
the eyes of the public.
Organizations !
In accordance with the ac­
tion taken by Student Coun­
cil, the officers of all campus 
organizations—including fra­
ternities, clubs, publications, 
and other groups—are re­
quired to submit a list of the 
names of all members to Stu­
dent Council.
These lists should be in by 
November 28 at the latest and 
may be sent to Council 
through inter-school mail or 
left at Carnegie Union or the 
office of the Dean of Students 
(AH 144).
Organizations are also urged 
to check the list of freshmen 
who have not passed the 
1'raditions Exam and to en­
courage them to take it at 
the earliest possible opportu­
nity.
Satire On Commercial Drama 
Now On Little Theater Stage
Carnegie’s drama department opened its second major production 
last Saturday with Luigi Pirandello’s famous play, Six Characters in 
Search of an Author.
The Carnegie department is one of the first to use Denis Johnston’s 
English adaptation of the^new 
play.
The production, a play within 
a play, is one of the most original 
to be seen on the modern stage. A 
comedy in the making, the play is 
a bare stage dramatization of the 
artistic process of play producing 
itself in relation to the problem of 
reality and unreality. It is an iron­
ical satire of the commercial dra­
ma, as we know it today, mixed 
more or less artificially with a 
rather obvious philosophy of neo­
idealism.
The play is being produced by 
Henry Boettcher, drama depart­
ment head, who has just returned 
from a two-year leave of absence 
in Europe.
Settings for Six Characters in 
Search of an Author, a celebrated 
play in Europe during the twen­
ties, has been designed by Wil­
liam Ball while the lighting is un­
der the direction of William Nel­
son.
The cast is composed of the fol­
lowing , students: John Ragin as 
father; Rosina Ferhoff, mother; 
Hermine Dubroff, step-daughter; 
Robert Samulowitz, son; John Zis- 
selman, director; and Josephine

Help Week
Wylie Ave. Boy’s Club 
Cleaned And Painted
Alpha Tau Omega initiated Help 
Week in Pittsburgh October 27 
when the active chapter and 
pledges spent the afternoon work­
ing and painting at the Kay Boy’s 
Club on Wylie avenue.
Fifty- five men converged on the 
club in old clothes to clear and 
paint the boundary fence, paint 
the stairwell and gymanisum 
walls, and clean the building’s 
chandeliers.
The Help Week plan has receiv­
ed much publicity since it was first 
introduced by ATO at Indiana 
University in 1949. Many fraterni­
ties, especially in the midwest, are 
adopting this system, finding that 
it pays off, not only -in better rela­
tions with the community, but in 
increased unity within the chap­
ter. This is the first time that such 
a plan has been carried out by a 
Pittsburgh fraternity.

Curtain time is 8:15 p.m. on No­
vember 13-20, with a matinee slat­
ed for 3:30 p.m. on November 16. 
Some tickets are still available in 
the drama office.
Junior Dance 
Cancelled;
No Interest
Lack of student support forced 
the cancellation of the Junior class 
“Sadie Hawkins’ Brawl,” origin­
ally scheduled for last Friday 
night.
Most indications before the 
dance pointed to a poor turnout, 
and, with pressure from Student 
Council, the class officers decided 
to reschedule the affair.
Plans have been made to hold 
the dance on February 8, when it 
will be the first of the second se­
mester. Class of ’53 officers hope 
that the rescheduled dance will be 
as much of a success as were the 
two previous dances held on this 
theme.

StudentCouncil Action Demands 
Observance Of Traditions Rules
Every Campus Organization Must Submit 
List Of Frosh Members To Dean's Office
Student Council has adopted a “get-tough” policy with fresh­
men who didn’t pass their traditions exams. Nearly 40% of the 
538 students eligible to take the test either flunked it or failed to 
show up on either of the two occasions it was given.
Council, therefore, has decided* 
to take the following action 
against these students. All campus 
organizations will be requested to 
submit a list of their members to 
the Student Council. Council will 
then examine the list and report 
to the heads of the various activi­
ties any of the members who did 
not pass the traditions exam.
The various organizations will 
be expected to drop those students 
who had not passed the exam.
Any organization under the direct 
jurisdiction of Student Council 
which does not comply with this 
ruling within two weeks after no­
tification will have its budget ap­
propriation withheld by Council.
Fred Tonge was appointed 
chairman of a committee which 
will give further exams to stu­
dents who wish to take it again.
Council also approved a motion 
to allow tickets to be sold on 
campus for a CARE dance to be 
held December 7. Proceeds from 
the dance will be used to buy 
books for European school chil­
dren.
It was reported in SC meeting 
that the three amendments to the 
Student Council Constitution were 
passed in the all-school assembly 
by votes of 9-0, 8-1, and 8-1.
In other business conducted,
Alpha Phi Omega received an ap­
propriation of $25 for decorating 
equipment.
Draft Jitters?
All students who have 
problems concerning their se­
lective service status are re­
quested to contact the office 
of Dean Webster N. Jones,

Now Working In Skibo 
Will Start Night School
Recently the YWCA welcomed 
Julius Foris, a displaced Hungar­
ian student, to the Carnegie Tech 
campus. After many months of 
waiting, the organization has 
found success in its efforts to give 
one more displaced European stu­
dent a chance to find a new life 
and further his education in the 
United States.
- Foris was born in Hungary in 
1927 and in 1944 he and his fam­
ily were forced to leave their 
country because Hungary was 
gradually coming under Com­
munist influence. The family mov­
ed to Germany.
After the allied victory in 1946 
he attended the English Institute 
of Heidelberg, Germany, until 
1947. Finishing high school, he 
hoped to enter the Munich Insti­
tute for Professional Photography, 
but conditions in Europe, made 
this impossible. A qualified pro­
fessional photographer, Foris 
hopes to continue in this field and 
also painting. He took several pic­
tures of his crossing from Europe 
to the United States, and has 
brought most of his equipment 
with him.
Since his arrival on the Tech 
campus, Foris has been employed 
at Skibo. When the second se­
mester begins he plans to attend 
some night school classes to once 
again resume his education.
Foris has left his mother and 
father and a younger brother in 
Europe. The Y hopes that some 
time in the near future the fam­
ily can get together again, this 
time in the United States.
Tau Beta Pi Adopts 
Individual Tutoring
Tau Beta Pi has entered into its third year of student tutoring 
with a new plan of aid to students who need help in various courses. 
This year private tutoring is to be given individually to those who 
desire such help.
Two years ago when Tau Beta 
Pi tutoring first begn, special 
classes were scheduled for the 
various courses. With this meth­
od, a tutor was required to be 
present at a certain hour each 
week.
Many Faults
However, there were many 
faults to be found with this sys­
tem which the new system seems 
to do away with. Fir^t, some 
weeks no students would show up 
for the session. If this would con­
tinue for several weeks, the in­
structor might lose interest and 
miss a week when a number of 
students would show up. Second,
satisfy all those who were inter­
ested. From these conditions the 
new system arose.
Personalized Tutoring
Under the new system a student 
who is interested in help in one or 
more of his courses contacts Jack 
Herrington, who in turn helps the 
student contact a qualified tutor. 
The student and tutor then can 
arrange a time and place suitable 
to both. This system eliminates 
unneeded waste of time, much 
more individual time can be given 
to the student, and the student 
need not sit through a session of 
problems which would possibly be 
unrelated to his own.
Anyone interested in Tau Betaat times a great number of stu- ; Pi tutoring should call Jack Her- 
dents would be present for a . rington, MOntrose 1-3569. Stu-

Editorials—
School Spirit No Catch-All
At first glance the news was almost all bad this week 
from the nebulous sector of campus life called ‘school spirit.5 
Friday night’s pep rally fizzled, while cheering at Saturday’s 
game was almost non-existent once the tide turned against 
Carnegie. The Junior class Sadie Hawkin’s Day dance was 
cancelled for lack of student support, campus chest contri­
butions lagged far behind schedule, and traditions such as 
the senior fence and walk were fast becoming almost entirely 
forgotten.
But not all of these failings can be properly ascribed to 
that overworked sophism known as ‘lack of school spirit.’ Of 
late this term has become more and more a general excuse used 
by any organization which fails to draw response from the stu­
dent body for some activity—and these failings are often due 
to poor planning or execution on the part of the sponsoring or­
ganization.
A typical example is the Sadie Hawkins dance, can­
celled because of a ‘general lack of interest,’ or, in other 
words, advance ticket sales were extremely poor. It’s no 
wonder they were, because from reports reaching this office 
the publicity program was so poor that almost no one knew 
of the dance. Not only that, but poor scheduling put the 
dance on the night before the Pan-Hel formal, a policy 
sure to cause decreased attendance in that segment of* the 
student population which is largely responsible for the suc­
cess or failure of a dance—the greeks.
On the other hand, the poor showing at the pep rally 
and the game can hardly be explained on any other grounds 
other than a poor student attitude toward the whole busi­
ness. And here’s where the letters received from the Drexel 
college newspaper, urging football competition between 
Drexel and Carnegie, may offer a solution to the problem. 
(See ‘Letters to the Editor’ elsewhere on this page.)
From what can be gained from the letter, Drexel’s student 
body seems to be suffering ffom the same afflictions as Carne­
gie’s—lack of a focal point for student interest and enthusiasm. 
Athletic rivalry, especially competition with a traditional op­
ponent or opponents of similar background and ability, can form 
this focal point.
The formation of a football league composed of techni­
cal schools is not an impossibility although the problems 
would be many. Case, Carnegie, Lehigh, Drexel—perhaps 
Rensselaer—could form the nucleus of such a league; the 
standings of teams relative to other teams in the league 
would determine participating schools’ football fortunes for 
the year. Thus there would be traditional rivalries developed 
not just between two teams but between all members of 
the league. We feel that such rivalries, between schools of 
similar educational programs and athletic policies, would 
greatly increase ‘school spirit’ on all campuses involved.
This is no overnight solution—indeed, practical considera­
tions of transportation and previous commitments may 
make the plan impractical. But it is encouraging to see that 
students of other schools, facing problems similar to our 
own, are ready to work with us toward a solution beneficial 
to all.
Orchids
Orchids to ATO for a job well done! The local chapter 
—by its recent ‘Help Week’ project in the hill district—has 
teamed with the national organization in promoting a plan 
which includes both service to the community and to the 
fraternity system in general.
Perhaps Carnegie will soon join those other schools 
where all fraternities have turned the traditional hell week 
into Help Week. This is a project CFP might find interesting.

Letters to the Editor-
Drexel Editor Asks Competition 
Between Technical Colleges
The following letter, written by 
the editor of the Drexel college 
newspaper, may hold a partial so­
lution to the seeming dearth of 
campus spirit at Carnegie. Though 
the letter was sent as personal 
correspondence between staffs, the 
idea it contained was considered 
to be important enough to merit 
printing. See editorial.* * *
Editor, the Tartan:
In a recent discussion among 
Triangle staff members concerned 
with means of improving school 
spirit here at Drexel, it was gen­
erally agreed that sports contests 
held the most possibilities. In 
rooting together for a team, stu­
dents seem to be brought closer 
together in all things. The feeling 
of closeness and common aims 
seems to extend thereafter into 
other activities and events on 
campus.
At Drexel we have the problem 
of competing with the outside in­
terests of a majority of our stu­
dents who live in Philadelphia 
and commute daily to school. The 
Institute too often becomes, to 
commuting students, merely a 
place where they spend several 
hours each day in the course of 
their studies. We of the Triangle 
staff fear that such an attitude 
deprives the «student of many of 
the most important facets of col­
lege life embodied in extra-cur­
ricular activities.
The general conclusion, as I 
said, was that sport events were 
the most likely means of arousing 
a genuine school spirit. Further­
more, it was agreed that a good 
rivalry between Drexel and an­
other school would do much to­
ward getting the students behind 
Drexel.
We thought that Carnegie Tech 
would be a natural rivalry. There 
is no school on our present sched­
ules which is similar to Drexel; 
and, therefore, they offer no real 
rivalry. Drexel and Carnegie, on 
the other hand, seem to us to be 
so similar in many ways that we 
should be scheduling games with 
each other. .
Both schools are privately en­
dowed; both schools are technical 
universities located in major cities; 
berth schools schedule athletic 
events on approximately the same

level. There is a natural rivalry, 
moreover, between Pittsburgh and 
Philadelphia, the eastern and 
western portions of the state.
We think that an athletic rela­
tionship between your school and 
ours would be of mutual benefit.
Sincerely yours,
Vernon Z. Smith

Editor, the Tartan:
Although electioneering and 
campaigning may be beneficial to 
school spirit, it is our opinion that 
for the sake of cleanliness we 
could well do without the stamp­
ing of the “sanitary” napkins in 
Skibo. It is obvious that in the 
process of stamping these napkins 
they are handled by persons 
whose hands may not necessarily 
be clean. In addition, we do not 
relish the taste of ink with our 
coffee. We, therefore, recommend 
that Student Council take imme­
diate action to remedy this situ­
ation.

Time Analyzes 
Today7s Youth
“Silent Generation99 Is 
Tolerant, Resigned
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1951
The younger generation, always 
a bone of contention among older 
people, is coming in for a partic­
ularly large amount of criticism 
and analysis of late. There has 
been a great deal of interest tak­
en as to what the youth of Amer­
ica believe, think, and want.
Time magazine, recently pre­
sented a feature article on our 
generation (those from 18 to 28 
years of age) in which it founds 
modem youth tolerant, calm, in­
tellectually stodgy, but “still able 
to raise hell ” and seeking a faith.
Individual is Dying
Starting with the very accurate 
statement that it is nearly im­
possible to paint a picture of an 
entire generation, Time proceeds 
to paint its picture, and in a great 
many cases hits the nail square 
on the head, at least as far as its, 
statements can be verified from 
observing life here at Carnegie.
Sometimes Called the “silent 
generation,” we (Time says) say 
little, but wait for the hand of 
fate to lead us where it will. The 
individual, the person who will 
speak out, is disappearing.
Morals Confused
This resigned character and 
lack of enthusiasm may be clearly + 
seen in the apathetic and unspir- * 
ited attitude prevalent on cam­
pus, which has become very evi­
dent in the recent past. The trend 
is to plod along, say little, do only 
what is necessary, and often not 
that much.
Time describes our morals as 
confused and states that youth is 
unable to let itself go completely. 
There is always a subconscious 
desire to turn to the old grind.
Tolerant as a Whole
The generation as a whole is 
tolerant, and not easily shocked. 
Moral are considered a personal 
matter, not to be pried into by 
others. The young American see 
nothing wrong in others doing 
what he would not do himself, if 
they so desire.
He has no militant beliefs, and 
will sit a “docile note-taker,” in 
class and let his professor say , 
what he pleases about anything at 
all. And this, it seems, is a great 
annoyance to the faculty, who 
would like very much to be able 
to stir up a little fuss among 
their charges once in a while.
As a whole, Time sees a calm, 
confused group of people. It does 
not pass judgement, but makes a 
seemingly objective appraisal of 
the state of affairs, along with a 
few warnings which it might be 
well to consider. 1

With every passing year the tradition of the Senior Fence passes 
farther into obscurity. The fence, located between the Cut and Webb 
Hall was dedicated on May 24, 1923. It stands four and one-half 
feet high, and is 50 feet long. ?--------------------------------------------------
The fence is in five sections and 
is made of wood since steel beams 
were objected to on the grounds 
that initials could not be readily 
carved in them. Since it was 
built especially for seniors, it was 
considered unfair that underclass­
men should occupy seats of glory; 
consequently, a rule went into

effect that all those sitting on the 
fence would be asked to show 
their registration cards.
The most enforced rule, how­
ever, was that any freshman pass­
ing the Senior Fence had to doff 
his hat whether there were sen­
iors sitting thereupon or not. It 
was considered a very serious of­
fense for a freshman to be so dis­
obedient as not to take off his hat 
to those who were laboring their 
fourth year and were ready to 
graduate from Carnegie. As a 
very suitable punishment it was 
decreed that the guilty freshman 
scrub the Senior Fence under di­
rect supervision of the sophomores.
It was also unanimously decided 
by the graduating class of 1923 
that public parking be permitted 
after dusk—for couples only. Al­
though the tradition of the Senior 
Fence is unknown by many of the 
CIT students, it is a senior privi­
lege that should be passed on.

Recent Letters of Donation Often Alot Gifts 
For Non-Athletic Uses and Improvements Only
Growing reactions against high-powered football was empha­
sized in the letters of transfer which accompanied the recent Mel­
lon grants to both Carnegie and Pitt. The letters, forwarding similar 
grants of $300,000 to each institution, stated that:
“In the granting of these schol-< 
arships no special conditions 
should be applied except that ath­
letic promise or ability shall not 
be a deciding factor.”
“Not One Penny”
A recent article in the Pitts­
burgh Press quoted the director of 
one big educational trust as saying 
as saying that “not one penny of 
our money will ever go for any of 
that.’ (Referring to athletic schol­
arships.)
The report goes on to say that 
several of the big industrial schol­
arship funds established in recent 
years state emphatically that 
awards are to be made on the basis 
of academic standing, character, 
and need. These rules do not ex­
clude athletes from the awards, 
but, by not mentioning athletics 
specifically, athletic ability is ruled 
out as a factor on which to base 
scholarship awards.
Gentlemen’s Agreement 
Other trusts have a gentlemen’s
agreement with colleges to the ef­
fect that none of their money will 
be used to support athletics.
However, data on the recent 
trends in college alumni athletic 
contributions, usually vitally im­
portant to a high-powered athletic 
program, is unavailable. If these 
figures also show a decline over 
previous year, it could well indi­
cate a definite public reaction to 
recent sports scandals and athletic 
overemphasis.

Halferty’s Harriers Win Tri-State
Triumph Is Cl imax 
Of Undefeated Year
Carman Wins Individual Laurels__ NIn Team Victory For Halfertymen
The Carnegie cross-country team led by co-captain Bob Carman 
completed a perfect season of competition Saturday as they edged 
four other opponents to cop the coveted Tri-State championship.
Carman led runners from Westminster, Bethany, Slippery Rock,
Geneva, and Carnegie around the^-------------------------------------------------—
4.2 Schenley Park course in the 
time of 23:51 to take individual 
honors for the day. It marked the 
sixth time in seven meets this year 
that the slippery-heeled Carman 
has finished first for the Tartans.
Carman’s only lapse was a second 
place finish to team-mate David 
Douglas in a dual meet at Case.
Team Victory 
Although Carman led the Skibos 
by taking individual honors, it was 
a team victory for the Halferty­
men. Co-captain John Cooper ran 
his usual steady race as he finished 
fifth in 24:40 for the Plaid. Run­
ning their best races of the year,
Chuck Gough, Alan Hayes, and 
Ron Campbell came through with 
eighth, tenth and fourteenth places 
to insure a Carnegie win.
This year’s perfect slate for the 
harriers betters the mark of last 
year’s track squad which finished 
the regular season undefeated but 
finished third in the Tri-State. The 
perfect record includes wins over 
Jeannette, Geneva, Bethany, Case,
Slippery Rock and Westminster in 
addition to the Tri-State cham­
pionship.
Westminster, last year’s Tri- 
State champions, finished second 
Saturday followed by Bethany and 
Slippery Rock tied for third and 
fourth. Carnegie with 38 points 
was 8 ahead of Westminster with 
46 while Bethany and Slippery 
Rock each had 78.
W anted!
The TARTAN is in dire 
need of prospective sports 
editors for next year’s staff. 
Annual staff changes will be 
made in April and at the 
present time there is a dearth 
of experienced candidates for 
sports staff pcsitions.
Requisites for sports editor 
are an ability to pass fresh­
man English and an ambition 
to work hard. Working hours 
run approximately 10 - 15 
hours per week. Anyone in­

Lehigh Defeats Tartans nfov 
W ith Last Half Scoring Spree
Gridders Play Lehigh Even In First Half; 
Superior Manpower Makes Final Difference
A crowd of 3000 at Forbes Field had to take their hats oil to 
Lehigh Saturday. The smartly-drilled Engineers had the power and 
finesse when it was needed as they defeated a hard-fighting Carnegie 
eleven 34-7. • * “
Lehigh exploded for 27 points in 
the second half and put the game 
on ice after they had. been held 
to a 7-0 halftime margin by an 
aroused team of Tartans. For 30 
minutes the Plaid played the 
Brown and White to a standstill, 
only to succumb finally to su­
perior manpower in the closing 
cantos.
Player Mixup
The score might well have been 
0-0 at the intermission mark ex­
cept for a mixup in substitution.
With only ten Carnegie players 
on the field, Joe Kryla for Lehigh 
went through a hole in the center 
of the line where the eleventh 
Skibo should have been and rac­
ed 80 yards from his own 20 for 
the only score of the half.
On the series of plays before
Delta Tau Delta Cops 
IM Grid Championship
In a hard fought game last Wednesday, November 7, Delta Tau 
Delta defeated Sigma Nu 19-17 to capture the coveted campus intra­
mural football championship. The win was a victory for “heads-up” 
defensive play as the Delts spotted the losers two touchdowns in the 
first half but held their opponents ?---------------------;
to only one point in the second 
half as they came strongly from 
behind.
The Delt forward wall of Cun­
ningham, Trinkhaus, and Devlin 
kept the Sigma Nu passing attack 
-—in the person of Jim Holthaus— 
bottled up during the whole sec­
ond stanza. Downfield Jones, 
Braun, Gierl and Trettel stopped 
those passes that did get by the 
line.
Holthaus Passes
The Sigma Nu offense was pri­
marily Holthaus. Holthaus usually 
passed to whoever was open, either 
Bushey, Connelly, Thorpe, Harvey, 
or Warren. If none was open, 
Ho' haus himself ran with the ball.
T e Delt attack found Bill Gierl, 
Bill Jones, and P. S. Trettel hand­
ling the ball with Don Braun and 
Bill Devlin at the wings and Mike 
Hai y at center.
1.2 game started with the Delts 
kick''.i? out of bound to the Sigma 
Nu’s. A Holthaus to Thorpe pass 
fallowed by a Holthaus rush down 
the middle netted the sigma Nu’s 
a 1-0 lead. The SN attack stalled 
then on 3 incompleted passes. The 
Delts tied the score as Jones hit 
Braun for 20 yards and a first 
down.
Regaining the ball, the Sigma 
Nu’s moved downfield with Holt­
haus tossing to Bushey and Harvey 
for first downs. On a beautifully 
executed double reverse Bushey 
went around right end for a fourth 
down touchdown and an 8-1 lead.
Delts Fight Back
The Delts kept in the game as 
Jones completed a long pass down
the center to Mike Hardy which 
was good for 50 yards and 5 points. 
The Sigma Nu’s continued their 
driving, however, as two Holthaus 
passes to Thorpe were good for a 
first down and a TD. The period’s 
scoring was topped off as Connelly 
caught Jones in the end zone for 
a safety and two points for the SN. 
At the half the score was 16-6, 
Sigma Nu.
The second half was a different 
game as the Delts moved almost at 
will while their opponents couldn’t 
seem to get going. Trettel passed 
to Braun for a first down and Gierl 
ran for another one pointer. On an 
end around, Don Braun dove j 
through three Sigma Nu’s for the 
touchdown. A Gierl to Devlin pass ' 
made it 14-16 as the quarter ended. 
With darkness falling rapidly, the 
Delts scored again as Gierl flipped j 
the ball to Braun in the end zone 
for the game’s final touchdown.
A Connelly to Holthaus pass j 
gained one point for the SN, but 
the threat was cut short as Gierl j 
intercepted another Holthaus pass. I 
After that, it got too dark to see, j 
let alone play football. The game ; 
ended with the final score standing j 
Delta Tau Delta 19, Sigma Nu 17, ! 
and the Delts in possession of the J 
all-school IM football champion- I 
ship.
the Tartans had muffed their best 
opportunity of the afternoon as 
they failed to score after Tom 
Craig had blocked a Herb Weiss 
punt on the Lehigh 14. The Skibos 
were hurt by the absence of John­
ny Luchok who had reinjured his 
ailing leg in the final minutes of 
the first quarter and was in the 
dressing room for repairs.
Third Quarter Letdown
The Tartans’ splendid play in 
the first half and the Engineers’ 
slight 7-0 lead gave Carnegie 
rooters hope at the intermission. 
However, Lehigh’s third quarter 
play quickly settled the issue. At 
the end of the quarter the Brown 
and White was ahead 20-0 as they 
scored the first two times they 
handled the ball.
Lehigh went on the ground for 
their second six pointer as the 
Carnegie line began to weaken 
from the assualts of fresh pla­
toons of Brown and White substi­
tutions. Weiss scored on a 13 yard 
dash around right end and Walt 
Trillhaase added his second of 
four conversions. A Tartan fum­
ble led to the second TD as Weiss 
culminated a drive from midfield 
with a pass in the end zone to 
end Tom Gunn.
Tartans Score
Early in the fourth quarter the 
Tartans scored their only touch­
down in two years against the En­
gineers. On a beautifully executed 
play Quent Holtz hit end Fritz 
Wilson with a pass in the left 
flat. Wilson lateralled to Luchok 
who went over the goal line 
standing up. After missing a field 
goal attempt in the second quar­
ter, Gil Dissen kicked the con­
version to make it 20-7.
The Engineers didn’t let the 
Tartans rally as quick-opening

Saturday, November 17 will be a special day for nine 
seniors on the Carnegie gridiron squad. For Quent Holtz, 
Hans Lange, John Luchok, Arne Oberg, Bob Odeh, George 
Rusnak, Dale Startzell, Ted Leaman, Fritz Wilson, and mana­
ger Ed Mitchell the Westminster game will mark the last 
time they don the Tartan plaid on the football field.
This group dserves more than the usual commendation given 
departing seniors. In their four years at Carnegie they, with the 
help of Coach Eddie Baker and his staff, have completely re­
versed the fortunes of Carnegie in gridiron competition. In 1946 
Carnegie didn’t score a point in a football game; in 1947 they 
didn’t win a game. However, beginning with this group of seniors 
Tartan pigskin fortunes turned. In 1948 the Skibos won 1 of 8;
in 1949 the slate showed 4 wins, 3 losses and 1 tie; in 1950
the Tartans matched the all-time Carnegie record with 7 wins
and only 1 loss; and this year in 1951 they have won 5 of 7
to date.
No School Monday—
The possibility of a victory celebration Monday in case 
of a Tartan victory over Lehigh was effectively scotched 
Saturday with the Lehigh win. However, an unprejudiced 
observer of student conduct Friday night and Saturday af­
ternoon might have wondered why the possibility was ever 
discussed. Students who lack interest to support their team 
at pep rallies prior to the game, who lack enthusiasm to 
cheer their team at the ganie, certainly don’t have a super­
abundance of spirit demanding they demonstrate after the 
game. If students were as genuinely interested in the foot­
ball team as in “No school Monday,” there would be more 
school spirit and less chanting.

cide when a 
class meeting is 
to be held, and 
discuss among 
t h e m s e 1 ves 
what is to be 
done at these

sent the class both in school, and 
after graduation.

We very sel­

don’t ask us our 
opinions as our representatives 
should, and they . don’t organize 
the class as a whole.
Gwendolyn Sheffey, Fresh. P&D:
So far, I’ve not 
seen much evi­
dence of the 
duties or activ­
ities of class 
officers. There 
wasn’t enough 
publicity about 
the elections 
until they were 
over. They just 
said “Everyone 
vote!” and we voted. I haven’t 
seen the results of the election 
yet, or what these new class of­
ficers intend to do for the class 
or the school.
I
that in all the 
time I have 
been here, I 
haven’t seen 
any effects of 
what officers 
have done. They 
just seem to be 
fellows with ti­
tles, and really 
n o offices. I 
have not seen any evidence in 
which they actually represent the 
class.
Jim Anderson, Fresh. Chem.: In 
this school, 
from what I’ve 
heard, class of­
ficers are of no 
use. The cam­
paign helps the 
Freshmen get 
to know each 
other better,

ing t o g e t her. 
However, the 
person who wins just gets the 
publicity and honor but no real 
authority out of it.

Parking Trouble
Parking here at CIT has its difficulties, especially with everyone 
i wanting to occupy the same choice spots. This has created congested 
i situations in some regions which require careful handling of cat s.
! Parking in front of Fine Arts with other cars parked along the far 
curb at right angles is just such a congested condition.
• Through carelessness on Friday, October 26, a car parked in 
front of Fine Arts backed into a 1950 two-tone green Chevrolet 
l owned by John Hundertmark, an evening school student. The car 
was damaged to the extent of $92, which John had to pay out of 
his own pocket.
It seems indeed small of the erring person to attempt to hide 
from paying his just debt, especially when he is probably cairying 
insurance to cover any such accidents. Crimes have a way of being 
discovered, and this certainly is a crime in the eyes of the Pennsyl­
vania Department of Highways. However, John is perfectly willing 
to settle without the aid of the Highway Department if the careless 
' person will do his part.
John is anxious to assemble more information concerning hia 
accident, so he would appreciate hearing from anyone else who wit­
nessed the accident. His address is: John Hundertmark, 2862 Espy 
i Ave., Pittsburgh 16, Pa.
This incident should serve as a warning to others to be more 
I careful about parking their cars, and especially to make certain you 
are not blocking the next person. Many of the parking areas are 
j not being fully occupied, especially the rather convenient, large lot 
on the cut which is accessible from Forbes Street.
Monte Carlo Party Scheduled 
For This Saturday, Nov. 17
Are you tired of spending Saturday night at a movie or a dance? 
Of course you are. Well, here’s something different! A real gambling 
hall complete with roulette wheels, dice tables, bird in the cage, horse 
races, and other favorite games of chance.
At this point you are probably^-----------------------------------------------------*
thinking, “I can’t afford that kind 
1 of entertainment.” You’re right!
I Neither can we. As a result of 
I this condition, Evening Student 
Council has made arrangements 
| to issue $1,000 to every person 
j with a 75 cent ticket to the Monte 
; Carlo Carnival to be held in This­
tle Hall, Saturday, November 17.
Of course it will be fake money, 
but you can imagine the fun it will 
be risking ten or twenty dollars 
on a turn of a roulette wheel or 
a throw of the dice. And that’s 
not all. You may get something 
more than a good time at gamb­
ling. A prize will be given to the 
man and woman who finishes the 
evening with the most money. In 
addition, a door prize will be 
awarded the holder of the lucky 
ticket stub.

cents, isn’t it? But there wifi be 
a lot more! On the lower floors 
of Thistle Hall, in the Black Cat 
lounge, there will be continuoua 
music provided for dancing from 
8:45 p.m. to 12:00 p.m. Refresh­
ments will also be sold in the 
Black Cat. We believe that this 
is a case where you are really 
getting something for your money. 
And there’s more!
A White Elephant auction will 
also be held at the carnival. White 
elephants are articles you don’t 
need but something someone else 
could use. Donations to the White 
Eelephant auction may be left at 
Mr. McKelway’s office or given 
to Marcell Sessi or Don Walker. 
The White Elephants will be auc­
tioned off for stage money only.
More Money Available
The setting of the gambling 
room will be authentic. A the­
atrical agent is in charge of the 
setting up of the tables and suit­
able decorations.
If you go broke, another $1,000 
may be obtained at the door for 
a nominal sum of 25c. Get your 
extra $1,000 at the door when 
you pick up your free $1,000.
Get your tickets before they are 
j all gone. Tickets are 75 cents 
! per person. Again w.e state, the 
j affair will be held on Saturday, 
j November 17, in Thistle Hall. 8:45 
! p.m. to 12:00 p.m.
Come alone to the carnival or 
| bring your wife, girl friend, or 
I anyone you like. You’ll be sorry 
if you miss this wonderful night 
j filled with a new and different 
kind of entertainment.
