PhiO To Sponsor 
AnnualCITContest
The annual Ugliest Man on Campus contest, conducted 
for the benefit of Campus Chest, begins next week. Instead 
of deciding which girls is the prettiest on campus, this selec­
tion will determine the ugliest male. The girls will undoubt- 
find it almost as difficult to*
¿sie
?iy nna it almost as 
ake a choice as will the men.
Anyone is eligible to be UMOC 
if he is male and is a student at 
Techt Faculty members were 
barred in order to preserve some 
degree of competition. The dead­
line for entries has been extended 
until 4:40 p.m. Friday, February 
28 to give everyone time to talk 
¿ends into running. To enter, all 
has to do is submit a 5x7 
photograph of himself with the 
name and sponsor on the back to 
the Dean of Students’ Office.
Unlimited Voting
Those who are at their wits end 
deciding for whom to vote in the 
numerous queen elections will be 
able to split their votes in the 
coming contest. Stuffing the ballot 
box is definitely in order. Voting 
isfc unlimited'—only one cent per 
vffte. No checks or pledges. Pro­
ceeds will be given to this year’s 
Campus Chest for distribution to 
worthy charities. Day to day rela­
tive standings will be broadcast 
over WRTC at 7:15 p.m. and 11:45 
p.m., as well as posted at the bal­
loting table from 11:30 to 1:30 in 
Skibo.
The ugly winner will be pre­
sented to Greek Swing, March 6. 
, tn recognition of his unusual nat- 
tftil gift, he will receive the “Ugly 
Mug,” which by the way will hold 
up to three quarts of any bever­
age. Filled appropriately, it is cap­
able of toasting the drunkest Ugli­
est Man on Campus for the rest 
of the evening.
Dr. Norman Knox 
Presents Second 
English Lecture
This morning at 11:30 in the 
Fine Arts Theatre, Dr. Norman 
Knox presented the second lec­
ture in the current English de­
partment series devoted to liter­
ary masters. Dr. Knox’s speech 
concerned the “Canterbury Tales 
and why they are still among the 
foremost works of English authors. 
-».A graduate of Swarthmore Col­
lie, Dr. Knox took graduate work 
at the University of Pennsylvania 
and at Duke University, where he 
received his doctorate in Middle 
English in 1956. Dr. Knox came to 
Tech in the fall of 1956 as an in­
structor and at the end of the year 
was promoted to assistant pro­
fessor.
In his lecture, Dr. Knox discuss 
ed the various aspects of the 
“Canterbury Tales” and the char- 
JCter of Chaucer’s mind. Chaucer, 
he said, was aware of the same 
conditions of human life as Sopho­
cles but he took the comic rather 
than the tragic point of view 
about them.
Next Tuesday morning at 11:30, 
Dr. Beekman, W. Cottrell, will 
speak on Ibsen in the third of the 
series. Dr. Cottrell will discuss the 
relevance of Ibsen today and how 
his works are just as pertinent as 
•Ley were at the turn of the cen 
tury.
Theta Xi Places 
First In Grades; 
PiKA Second
A survey of the fraternity and 
school factors for the fall semes­
ter has revealed that only three 
fraternities had averages above 
the all men’s average and only 
two above the all school average. 
For the first time since 1955 one 
of the fraternities has fallen be­
low the 2.00 for the fall semester. 
Compared with the all school 
average over the past three fall 
terms this year’s 2.374 appears to 
be consistent with 2.37 in 1957, 
2.35 in 195Q and 2.359 in 1955.
To date the sorority averages 
have not been released. Appar­
ently there is a difference in points 
in the fourth and fifth decimal 
place between the first and second 
place and two other close averages 
for fourth place. At present the 
school is processing the sorority 
averages again and checking with 
the sororities to make sure that 
all actives have been included. 
They should be released some 
time this week.
The fraternity averages, all 
school average and men’s aver­
ages are as follows:
Theta Xi .....................2.572
Pi Kappa Alpha ..............2.439
Alpha Tau Omega.............2.326
Delta Upsilon .....................2.310
Beta Theta Pi....................2.306
Sigma Alpha Epsilon ... 2.297
Beta Sigma Rho.................2.291
Phi Kappa...........................2.225
Sigma Nu............................2.147
Delta Tau Delta................2.076
Tau Delta Phi ..................2.040

Russians Provide 
Extensive Training 
In Science, Math
The average twelfth-grade Rus­
sian student has a better scientific 
education than most American 
college graduates. That’s the ob­
servation of world traveler John 
Bunther, who recently returned 
from a tour of Russia.
Soviet emphasis on science de­
mands grueling effort from pupils, 
Gunther reports in the March 
Reader's Digest. Every student 
preparing for college must take 
ten years of math, four of chem­
istry, five of physics and six of 
biology.
The Soviet child attends school 
213 days a year, as against 180 in 
the United States. Homework as­
signments requiring from four to 
six hours’ work daily are not un­
common.
Being accepted into college is 
probably the most important 
single event in a Soviet citizen's 
life, Gunther feels. The univers­
ity graduate inevitably wins honor 
and financial rewards — often 
much sooner than our own grad­
uates. All that the non-graduate 
can hope for is a manual or 
clerical job on a farm or factory.
Moscow University, completed 
in 1953, is the city’s proudest 
building. It is, except for the 
Eiffel Tower, the tallest structure 
in Europe. Its cost, $750 million,

On March 7 and 8, the Greeks will participate in the only

and his orchestra, who played for Greek Swing in 1955, will

To Present 
Harmony
The name of this year’s Scotch 
’n Soda production is “Harmony.” 
The musical comedy, annually one 
of the features of Tech^s Spring 
Carnival Week, will be presented 
on April 28, 29, 30, and May 1, 
with an extra performance on 
April 27 a possibility.
The plot revolves around the 
middle nineteenth century settle­
ment of Old Economy at Am- 
bridge, Pennsylvania. Although 
the members of the settlement 
were deeply religious, they en­
joyed a great material prosperity. 
Cotton, silk and other craft pro­
ducts found ready markets be­
cause of their high quality. Over 
a period of years a surplus of 
capital enabled investment in both 
the New York Central and Penn­
sylvania railroads.
One of the more unique char­
acteristics of the settlement was 
the practice of celibacy. This in 
combination with unwise invest­
ments led to the decline of the 
community and resulted in its dis­
solution in 1905.
Using a liberal amount of his­
torical fact such as that described 
above, Scotch ’n Soda’s writers 
have woven a musical comedy in­
volving a love story and the steal­
ing of the Harmony Society’s 
money. In addition to the Har­
mony settlement will be seen the 
keel boatmen who sailed down 
the Ohio.
In recent weeks Scotch ’n Soda 
has been holding auditions for the 
cast. The cast will be announced 
sometime early this week. A party 
is planned for the cast and pro­
duction staff Sunday, March 2 in 
Morewood Gardens.
The following are the principals 
in this year’s S ’n S production— 
Director, Saul Swimmer; Book 
and Lyrics, Jack Zierwold; Music­
al Director, Burke Caldwell; Set 
Designer, Don Beaman; and Cos­
tumes, Katy Treon.
In the past few weeks the prin­
ciples and other interested mem­
bers of the Scotch ’n Soda Cluo 
have been visiting Old Economy 
for ideas for sets and scenes. 
There are yet seventeen surviving 
structures including halls, the 
house of the founder, Grotto in 
the gardens and a number of 
shops and dwellings.
this time the fall scholarships tro­
phies will be presented, the UMOC 
will be given his Ugly Mug and of 
course the winners of Greek Sing 
will be awarded their trophies and 
perhaps be requested to sing one 
of their winning songs.
Greek Sing, one of thhe biggest 
events of the spring semester, 
will begin at 8:00 on March 7, at 
Carnegie Music Hall. Twenty 
groups will be performing this 
year: twelve fraternities, seven 
sororities, and a new group com­
posed of Sigma Alpha Iota and
Pershing Rifles Dance Saturday
Pershing Rifles Queen Candidates

Pershing Rifles, a national 
honorary military society, will 
bring its pledging activities to a 
close with its annual dance on 
Saturday, March 1 from 9 to 12 
in Thistle Hall.
The highlight of the dance will 
be the crowning of the company’s 
honorary sponsor during the in­
termission. From the three final­
ists, Teri Reisberg, Arden Bahl. 
and Denise Getsie, a queen was 
elected. The society elected their 
sponsor on January 7; however, 
her identity will be kept secret 
until it is announced at the dance 
by the present sponsor, Rita 
Menke. At this time she will pre­
sent the new queen with her 
crown and sceptor and captain 
shields. The new queen will then 
fourragere the fifteen new actives 
—give them the blue and white 
shoulder cords which signify their 
membership in the corps.

Industrialist’s Daughter 
Donates Schenley Park
By Toni Nelson
Tech Campus, barren and dreary as it was in the 1850’s, 
had one asset that gave it a certain claim to distinction. It 
bordered on a beautiful stretch of open country that was 
shortly to become Schenley Park.
In the days immediately fol-^-------------------——-------------------- —
lowing the Revolution, James
O’Hara, first quartermaster gen­
eral of the United States Army by 
appointment from George Wash­
ington, had prospered in Western 
Pennsylvania as a trader, glass 
maker, ship builder, brewer, iron 
manufacturer and land operator. 
He has been called Pittsburgh’s 
first captain of industry. Having 
vision and the abaility to foresee 
the rich possibilities of Pittsburgh, 
he acquired a great deal of land 
in this area. What is now Schen­
ley Park, he acquired in 1813.
Mary Croghan
It was O’Hara’s granddaughter, 
Mary Croghan, who profited from 
this foresight. Miss Croghan, 
eloped from a fashionable board­
ing school on Staten Island to 
marry an English army officer, 
Captain Edward W. H. Schenley. 
She spent the rest of her life on 
the other side of the Atlantic.
Yet, she didn’t forget Pittsburgh. 
At frequent intervals she turned 
over parcels of the land inherited 
from her grandfather. Her most 
generous benefaction was 300 of 
the best unimproved acres re­
maining within the city limits, to 
which she later added 100 more 
acres for such a small amount of 
money that it might as well be 
considered a gift. This bequest, 
made in 1888, was named Schen­
ley Park in her honor.
Reading Revives 
In America; Public 
Seeking Classics
A bookish TV lecture series that 
became a smash hit is the latest 
link in a chain of evidence that 
adds up to a “reading revolution” 
in America. C. Lester Walker de­
scribes the unique situation in a 
March Reader’s Digest article, 
“The Big Boom in Good Books.”
The telecast, Walker reports, 
was handicapped by a forbidding 
title (“Modern Fiction from 
Stendhal to Hemingway”), a hor­
rible hour (6:30 a.m.) and the 
prospect of an unknown lecturer 
(Dr. Floyd Zulli of New York 
University) talking about books. 
Yet it drew an estimated 150,000 
viewers in the New York area.
By the Monday following the 
first TV lecture on Stendhal’s
“The Red and the Black,” not a 
copy of that novel could be bought 
in New York City bookstores. 
Eager sunrise scholars had clean­
ed them out.
Even without benefit of TV ex­
posure, many books once deemed 
too “highbrow” for most citizens 
are enjoying a tremendous wave 
of popularity, Walker says. One 
publishing firm recently announc­
ed its 500,000th sale of “The Iliad” 
and its 800,000th sale of “The 
Odyssey.” A North Dakota reader 
write the publisher: “Just read 
‘The Odyssey.’ Boy, can that guy 
Homer write!”
Non-fiction too is basking in the 
warmth of popular success, Walk­
er reports. Such books as “The 
Great Dialogues of Plato,” Toyn­
bee’s “Greek Historical Thought” 
and Alfred North Whitehead’s 
“Adventures of Ideas” have soar­
ed to six-figure sales heights.
“Naked to Mine Enemies,” a 
scholarly, 530-page life of Cardin­
al Wolsey by Reader’s Digest Sen­
ior Editor Charles Ferguson, made 
best-seller lists in the second 
week following its publication.
When classics such as “Gone 
With the Wind,” “Moby Dick,” or 
“War And Peace” are shown on 
the screen, the effect is felt in 
bookstores, he says. The film ver­
sion of “Jane Eyre,” for instance, 
forced three book publishers to 
bring out new editions.

Lot Available; 
Use Advised
By 1905, when the Institute of 
Technology was beginning to rear 
its walls, this land had become an 
extensive reservation of 422 acres 
of rolling hills, serpentine drives, 
bridle paths, wooded ravines, a 
conservatory, and a golf course. 
It was certainly a most desirable 
next-door neighbor for the col­
lege.
Though the new parking lot be­
hind Morewood Gardens has been 
©pen for some time now, very few 
persons have been observed using 
it. The recent cold spell undoubt­
edly cut down the number of autos 
on campus, but with warm weath­
er ahead the commuters are to be 
advised that parking will probably 
become crowded and the new lot 
should be kept in minu.
Ski boots lace easier and faster, stay comfortably tight. They do so because the rawhide leather has been 
made more pliant with a special treatment perfected by Esso Research. The leather in the skiers boots, 
the wool in his socks—even the lacquer on his skis—were also made better with the help 
of other products derived from oil. ESSO RESEARCH works wonders with oil.

Editorial
Fraternity Factor si
Fraternity grades came out this past week and are a sad 
indication of the condition of the scholastic position of the 
male Greek population of Carnegie Tech. Since the spring 
semester of 1954—the semester prior to the entrance of the 
present four year seniors—the fraternities have averaged 
0.04 below the all-men’s average. This past semester the fra­
ternities were 0.08 below the all-men’s average.
It may be seriously asked whether the fraternities are 
serving any constructive purpose in the educational system of 
Carnegie Tech. Would Tech be better off with no fraternities 
at all? This is a very real question. Many, many campuses are 
quite satisfied with their non-Greek life and are quite oppos­
ed to the possibilities of fraternities on their campuses.
Fraternal Functions
Let us investigate what purposes fraternities serve on 
our campus. 1.) They are excellent providers of housing, 
which is short in this area. 2.) They are excellent outlets for 
the exuberance of youth, which erupts most often on week­
ends. 3.) They are builders of the social graces, one would 
like to think. 4.) They are providers of intramural teams. 
5.) They are providers of congenial surroundings for the stu­
dent in which he can find brotherhood and security away 
from home.
These things fraternities can do. And these they do well. 
Nonetheless, we may ask how much this contributes to the 
educational development of the brothers. In theory, it is true 
that the fraternity is supposed to encourage good scholarship 
and perhaps even stimulate intellectual activity. This means 
that the fraternities should be working constructively to im­
prove the academic standing of their members.
Continued Existence
Instead it appears that the fraternities are degenerating 
scholastically,- and are not upholding their standards. This is 
not an idle issue and it should be given very serious thought, 
especially by the fraternities if they are interested in their 
continued existence at Carnegie Tech. The success of non­
fraternity systems elsewhere and the difficulties present (and 
growing) here make the value of fraternities questionable.
To regain the falling scholastic prestige the Greek should 
consider rather drastic measures. E.H.R.

Snowman Middlin9 
Becomes New 
CIT Winter Sport
By Gissie Rafferty 
There is a new winter sport 
here at Tech for people who like 
to be the center of things. It is 
snowman middlin’. You just 
stand on the Cut with your arms 
outstretched and let your friends 
(??) pack snow around you; in ad­
dition to being the center of 
things, you get the wonderful psy­
chological reinforcement of “bold­
in'* things together.” Anyone who 
can think of a good synonym for 
things,” please drop the thing in 
campus for me. Criticism is grate­
fully accepted . . . and then burn­
ed.
Skiing at Seven Springs and 
Laurel Mountain has become the 
favorite pastime of many fraterni­
ties on campus. On Monday morn­
ings, it’s fun to listen to the cheery 
steps of week-end skiiers wend­
ing their way to ye olde 8:30—step, 
clunk, step, clunk, step, clunk. 
Trayriding 
Another fascinating innovation 
this year is “tray-riding.” Tray- 
riders are also known as “cleptos” 
in Skibo circles. I’m not exactly, 
sure of the correlation here, but 
the Pinkerton men are working 
on it right now. Tray-riders can 
easily be distinguished from regu­
lar toboggan or sled riders. First, 
they are usually not in the secre­

often have two parallel lines, like 
street-car tracks, on their winter

guessed it.
And now, at last, we come to 
that favorite sport of men in the 
engineering department — skating 
on thin ice. Underwater skating is 
also popular at Vestinghouse 
Pond. It’s almost worth the chill

Pitt student’s face when you 
look UP at him. Almost, but not 
quite . . .

Does The U. S. Really 
Uphold Its Ideals?
By Richard Block
There seems to be a question today as to 
whether the United States stands behind its ideals 
and integrity or behind its investments. This ques­
tion is quite naturally provoked by the strong sup­
port our country has given to dictators, primary in 
South and Central American countries.
Four years ago in Caracas, Venezuela, the 
Juridicial Political Committee of the tenth Inter- 
American Conference voted a ringing “declara­
tion of solidarity for the preservation of the polit­
ical integrity of the American states against inter­
national Communist intervention.”
The document cited “.The faith of the peoples of 
America in the effective exercise of representative 
democracy as the best means to promote their so­
cial and political progress.” The declaration was 
signed by seventeen nations, including Cuba, the 
Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. Argentina 
(then under Peron) abstained while Costa Rica, 
protesting that Venezuela was a military dictator­
ship, boycotted the entire Conference.
Arms Instead of Democracy
Unfortunatey, a number of Lc^in American 
governments have depended on U.S. arms rather 
than representative democracy to keep themselves 
in power. U.S. arms were an important factor in 
prolonging Venezuela’s military dictatorship under 
General Marcos Perez Jimenez. Now driven from 
his military haven, Jimenez has found refuge in 
the Dominican Republic, wherfe Generalissimo 
Rafael Trujillo is also receiving arms from the 
United States to support his dubious “democracy.” 
Another dictator, Fulgencio Batista of Cuba, is us­
ing American weapons against his enemies.
Drilling For Communists? %
With the fall of the Jimenez dictatorship goes 
a good deal of risk to American oil interests, which 
are extensive, in Venezuela. How can we be certain 
that the new found democratic government in that 
V country will not alter American oil arrangements 
in the national interest? Yet, here is a democracy 
replacing a totalitarian state. I wonder if some 
American patriot, who has oil interests, will sud­
denly reveal that the rebellion in Venezuela was 
Communist inspired and suggest that the United * 
States, in the interest of the freedom loving people 
of Venezuela, seek some way in which to help the 
crippled Jimenez, or a like prospect, regain his 
position. That oil’s worth a lot. How much?
Twelve Month Open Season For Witches 
The adage that new broom-sticks aren’t as 
cleansing as new brooms has been recently given 
renewed verve. Congress granted the House Un- 
American Activities Committee another $305,000.
The witch hunt will continue.

Action Stiffens 
As IM B-Ball
At Season Peak
By Edward Blum
The ranks of the undefeated 
have been lessened by three. Kap­
pa Sig’s Clyde Shockers were dealt 
^'^7-21 loss by the powerful ASCE 
Seniors, who had four players in 
double figures. John Ralston top­
ped the winners with 18 points; 
Dave Densmore tallied 13, and 
both Paul Sucevic and Richard 
White hit for 12. Jim Livengood 
led the losers, now 3-1 for the 
season, with 8 points.
The Kappa Sig A team retali­
ated, however, by toppling the 
previously unbeaten Unknowns 
_AJl-S0 in a thrilling contest. Lou 
Montini led the winners with 17 
points, 12 of which came in the 
furious second half. The Un­
knowns, brought to 3-1, were top­
ped in the scoring column by Joe 
Zaccardi’s 9 points. The win left 
Kappa Sigma atop the Tech 
League with a 2-0 record, just 
ahead of Citcom with their 1-0.
ATO A Over TKN
One of the most impressive wins 
of the season was registered in the 
i5£ibo League when ATO A de­
feated the TKN 42-29. Jim Muth 
of TKN topped all scorers with 
9 points, but the ATO’s were too 
strong as they piled up their third 
win in as many games. George 
Paris and Jim Bennett each tal­
lied 8 for the victors, and Phillips 
matched that number for TKN. 
Previously undefeated, TKN suf­
fered its lowest point total in four 
'^mes; it was the first time the 
t&am tallied fewer than fifty. The 
win all but clinched the League 
title for ATO, since the Grads, 
the only other undefeated team in 
the Skibo League, have yet to play 
either TKN or'the ATO’s, and are 
not expected to be able to survive 
the competition unscathed.
Beta Theta Pi A upset the Beta 
Sigma Rho A team 28-22 with a 
terrific fourth quarter barrage to 
become the first team in any 
^Jague to win four games. Half- 
time of the Plaid League contest 
saw the Beta Sigs leading 13-8, 
and at the end of the third quar­
ter they still led by four points, 
16-12.
Final Flourish
Then in the final period, the 
Beta offense began to click. Glenn 
Clark, the high scorer for the 
game with 9 points, tossed in -5 in 
the final frame,, while Dave Con- 
^roil and Dave Thomas each con­
tributed 4 to the fourth period 
cause. Jim Bartosh topped the 
losers with 8 points. The win 
gives Beta Theta Pi a 4-0 record 
for the season, and places them 
squarely in first place, ahead of 
the Delts, who have won their 
only game. The loss knocked Beta 
Sigma Rho out of the undefeated 
column, back into foui'th place in 
the tightly packed league.
i^ast year’s champion Rockets 
further consolidated their lead in 
the Kiltie League by trouncing 
Phi Kappa A 63-18. The win left 
the Rockets with a 3-0 record and 
the distinction of being the sole 
unbeaten team that has played
over one game in Kiltie League
competition.
The Architects, the team most 
likely to cop second honors in 
*be League, already are suffering 
1*om the loss, at the hands of ATO 
B, and lack the experience ¿nd 
depth to counter the favored 
Rockets.
As the teams near the end of
their schedules, the title race is
shaping up, and certain patterns 
are visible.' Citcom, victorious in 
their only game so far, appears 
destined to top the Tech League. 
ASCE Seniors cannot be stopped 
iivvhe Tartan League, and the 
t-iglishmen A look like a sure 
bet for the Scot League. Beta 
Theta Pi A looks too strong for 
the Plaid League
The two finalists last year are 
again this year the favorites in 
their respective leagues. ATO and 
the Rockets appear strong enough 
to go all the way this year too 
Thirteen teams are still undefeat­
ed, but the haze of doubt is lift­
ing. It looks like last year’s cham- 
(j.v>ns and runnerups will be bat- 
again on Intramural Night.
Two Swimming Victories
Skibo Swimmers Win 
Ninth Straight Contest
Last Friday the Tech swimming 
team journeyed to Kent, Ohio 
where it won its eighth straight 
swimming meet defeating Kent 
State, 46-40.
It was only the second defeat of 
the season for Kent State. Tech 
won only four of the ten events 
but placed men in every event to 
down Kent State.
Walt Riegler of Kent State set 
two records. He beat his own re­
cord of 2:25.5 in the 220 yard free­
style when he was clocked in 
2:23.0. Then he won the 440 yard 
freestyle in 5:24.4 to beat his old 
mark of 5:25.4.
Freshman Norm Willock swam 
his best meet of the season win­
ning the 200 yard backstroke in 
an excellent time of 2:32.5. Norm 
who was a member of the prep 
school All-American swimming 
team last year and should be a 
mainstay in the backstroke for the 
Tartans for the next three years.

State (Mayle, Holder, Braden, Psenka). 
Time: 4:26.8.
220-yard free style: Won by Riegler

record 5:25.4 by Riegler, 1957).
220-yard breast stroke: Won by Holder 
(KS); second, Derringer (T); third, 
Daugherty (T). Time: 2.42.7.
440-yard free stile relay: Won by
Schirm, Engleman, Crecine, Litch). 
Time: 3:54.1.
Following the Kent State meet, 
the Tartans traveled to Cleveland 
where they defeated Fenn College, 
46-40, in probably the most ex­
citing meet of the season. It was 
the first defeat for the Fenn swim­
ming team in ten meets.
Fenn had the individual stars as 
they took firsts in seven of the ten 
events, but Tech had the depth
and placed two men in all but two 
events. The individual Tartan vic­
tories came in the 400 yard med­
ley relay, the 200 yard butterfly 
and the 400 yard freestyle relay.
In the butterfly, Captain Mike 
Litch broke the pool record by 
winning the event in 2:39.1. Mike 
also swam in the victorious free­
style relay and gained a second in 
the 50 yard freestyle.
This coming Saturday, Tech is 
host for the Penn-Ohio Champ- 
ionships. The championships 
which start in the morning will be 
swam in the Skibo pool. Tech has 
an excellent chance to win their 
first championship trophy in six 
years.

lock, Daugherty, Barlow, Engleman. Time

Bowling Playoffs 
Schedule Saturday
The Obelisks and Sigma ,Nu “A” 
tied for first place in the Tartan 
League and will represent their 
league in the playoffs next week.
The Delts won the Kiltie League 
crown in a close battle with run­
ners-up Beta Sigma Rho and both 
these teams will enter the play­
offs for their league.
Last Saturday
The Phi Kaps had a chance to 
defeat the Beta Sigs and enter the 
playoffs in a match rolled last 
Saturday, but the Beta Sigs took 
two points to end Phi Kappa 
hopes.
Sigma Nu and ATO tied with 
each team taking two points, and 
this was enough to eliminate ATO 
from a playoff berth.
Jim Swisher of Sigma Nu lead 
bowlers this year with a high in­
dividual average of 176.5 pins. 
Bob Reber of SAE was second 
with a 173.7 average and Ed Mc- 
Ewen of ATO third with a 172.9 
average.
Sigma Nu also set a new record 
for high team series this year with 
a 772.8 game average.

Tartans Drop Two
Panthers Stop 
Winning Streak
The Tech basketball team had 
their five game winning streak 
ended when they dropped a 71-54 
decision to the strong Pitt Panth­
ers last Wedensdav evening at the 
Pitt Field House.
The Tartans v/ere without the 
services of freshman star Bill 
SofFa who was suffering from a 
bad cold. The Tech offense 
couldn’t move well without him. 
Early Lead
Pitt grabbed an early first half 
lead as Don Hennon, All-Ameri­
can candidate, Chuck Hursch, and 
Julius Pegeus couldn’t miss the 
hoop. The Panthers grabbed a 23 
point lead by halftime and held 
it to win.
The gameful Tartaiis fought 
back hard in the second half with 
Charley Goetz and “Whitey” 
Mueller clicking for several goals, 
but the rally fell far short.
Mueller lead Tech scorers with 
17 points. Pegeus was high for 
Pitt with 22. In the three quarters 
he played, Hennon was “held” to 
a mere 12 points.
Co vies W in In 
Closing Minutes
The Tartans dropped their sec­
ond game in a row last Saturday 
evening when they were defeated 
by the Geneva Covies 83-76.
Tech had a 39-35 lead at half- 
time and were nip and tuck with 
the Covies throughout the second 
half till Geneva broke the game 
wide open with a six point burst.
With the score knotted at 70 all, 
Don Schena scored with a jump 
shot and Tepkavick dropped in 2 
foul shots to give the Covies a four 
point lead. Schena added two 
more on a lay up to end Tech’s 
hopes of winning.
Bill Soffa again lead Tech scor­
ers with 25 points while captain 
John Tucci added 23. Schena scor­
ed 21 points for the winners.
The loss evened the Tartans 
season record at 10 wins—10 loss­
es. With four games remaining, 
the Tartans have an excellent 
chance to finish above the 500 
mark.

“I’ve taken part in all kinds of en­
gineering projects during the five years 
I’ve been with the telephone com­
pany,” says Bill Rhode, M.E., Tulane, 
’52. “Each project brings special 
problems to solve.
“Take a couple of recent jobs I did 
as examples. One was to plan and 
oversee the relocation of telephone fa­
cilities near a new drawbridge. The 
job included designs for attaching tele­
phone cable to the finished bridge and 
for providing service to the bridge- 
tender’s office and the locks.
“The other job was completely dif­
ferent. I was asked to make an ex­
perimental installation of some newly 
developed line concentrator equip­
ment. After selecting the test location, 
I engineered facilities for the remote 
concentrator unit, and trunk plant to 
the central office.
“Another thing about these jobs — 
they’re a result of the growth of the 
telephone business. Not only do prob­
lems like these keep life interesting 
for a telephone engineer, but they 
mean that careers are full of oppor­
tunities to show what you can do and 
get ahead.’*

anyway you like) for 1957 begins 
with Sputnik. It sees in the Soviet 
satellite “fresh evidence” that So­
viet technological progress was 
‘‘made possible to a large degree 
. . . by Soviet conspirators and 
their theft of some of our most 
vital military and scientific sec­
rets.” The report goes on to say, 
“the Communist operation today 
presents a menace more serious 
than ever before.” The HUAAC, 
its faith in the party strong, as­
sures us that “As the formal party 
structure recedes from view (re­
ferring to the closing of the Daily 
worker), it is being replaced by a 
widespread underground appara­
tus, duplicating beneath the sur­
face all the mechanism of Com­
munist party activities . . .”
Conservative Estimate
Part two of the seven part re­
port (each part released on a dif­
ferent day to increase sensation­
alism) began with the salemani- 
acal proclamation that “A nation­
wide campaign of political sub­
version, directed by the Commu­
nist Party and aided by numerous 
affiliate organizations, has spread 
throughout the United States dur­
ing the past year as part of what 
may emerge as the most success­
ful technique thus far devised by 
the Soviet apparatus in the United 
States. The Kremlin has succeeded 
in enlisting, at a conservative esti­
mate, more than a million Ameri­
cans into this campaign.” We’re 
glad the committee gave us a 
“conservative estimate.” It seems 
that the main objective of this 
vast network organization is abo­
lition of the House Un-American 
Activities Committee.
The committee claims to have 
identified “more than 200 organi­
zations charged with carrying on 
the communist program,” but for 
some reason names only three, the 
American Committee for Protec­
tion of the Foreign Born, the
Emergency Civil Liberties Com­
mittee, and the California Citizens 
Committee to Preserve American 
Freedom.
Though these organizations have 
trouble meeting their rent money, 
the HUAAC says they have 
“raised millions of dollars” and 
“they have been able to create a 
climate of opinion in which at­
tacks upon our immigration and 
security systems are made to ap­
pear an enlightened course of ac­
tion.” Repeal of the Walter-Mc- 
Carran immigration act is one of 
the objectives of conspiracy. 
Sagacity or Audacity?
An expert witness, Archibald 
Roosevelt, is quoted as pointing 
out that “These Red forces are a 
political army which is civilian in 
appearance and walk down the 
streets of America indistinguish­
able from the rest of the popula­
tion.” Bless his eyesight, x-ray 
vision.
Another expert witness, Bishop 
Fulton J. Sheen, is quoted as find­
ing the success of Communism in 
(1) the fact that it “comes into a 
world that is sick with relativism, 
and offers an absolute” and (2) 
because “some people—not all, 
God forbid—have an exaggerated 
interest in social justice.” Keep 
your eyes open and report all peo­
ple who believe in social justice. 
They should be watched.
Thou Shalt Not Stick Out Like 
A Sore Thumb
I am going to quote one para­
graph from a petition sent by 61 
Chicago residents to the 16 Chi­
cago area Congressmen asking the 
abolition of the House Un-Ameri- 
can Activities Committee. The 61 
signees of this petition are 61 
highly outstanding citizens. Is it 
out of the question that similar 
documents can be written and 
sent to Pittsburgh area Congress­
men?
“The Court now fully recognizes 
the serious threat to precious in­
dividual freedoms which the ac­
tivities of the House Committee on 
Un-American Activities may en­
tail. In the words of Chief Jus­
tice Warren: “ ‘Abuses of the in­
vestigation process may impercep­
tibly lead to abridgment of pro­
tected freedoms. The mere sum­
moning of a witness and compel­
ling him to testify, against his 
will, about his beliefs, expressions 
or associations is a measure of 
governmental interference. And 
when those forced revelations 
concern matters that are unortho- 
rox, unpopular, or even hateful to 
the general public, the reaction in 
the life of the witness may be dis­
astrous . . . Nor does the witness 
alone suffer . . . Those who are 
identified by witnesses and there­
by placed in the same glare of 
publicity are equally subject to 
public stigma, scorn and obloquy. 
Beyond that, thfere is the more 
subtle and immeasurable effect 
upon those who tend to adhere to 
the most orthodox and uncontro- 
versial views and associations in 
order to avoid a similar fate at 
some future time . .
We need some active interest in 
the doings and problems of the 
world around us. Even being well 
informed is not enough. We must 
take part in this country if it is to 
be truly ours. Inform others, write 
and speak with your congressman, 
do anything you can, but do some­
thing. Only those who take part 
in the existence around them have 
the right to criticize that existence.

University standards are severe, 
but there are many inducements 
for the student. He is paid by the 
state to go to college and can earn 
Substantial bonuses if his work is 
considerably above par. In adc ) 
tion, he is exempted from military 
service.
Careful planning has paid off 
for the Soviet government. Of all 
students enrolled in Russian Col­
leges, 65 percent aim for science 
degrees, as against only 10 per­
cent in the United States.
But impressive as it is, the 
Soviet educational system has its 
drawbacks, Gunther reports, 
Great gaps exist in the knowled_ ) 
of even the best educated. “The 
Russians are the most ignorant 
people in the world about affairs 
outside their own country,” he 
writes.
He detects a possibility that, in 
its eagerness to educate the great 
mass of its citizens, the Soviet 
government may eventually loosr 
en or change its structure.
“Once a class is created which 
is taught to think, particularly ^ 
scientific terms,” he writes, “it 
will sooner or later begin to think 
for itself in other fields.”
The article, “Russia Rings the 
School Bell,” is condensed from 
Gunther’s new book, “Inside Rus­
sia Today,” published by Harper 
& Bros.
