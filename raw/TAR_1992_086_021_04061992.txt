In 1982, the University Center was just an idea. In 1992, the University Center is already two years late.In 1982, Student Senate passed a “Statement of Needs,” compiled by a committee of students, administrators, and representatives from Stu­dent Affairs, that would let the administration know what students needed and expected from the new student union.In 1986 the administration announced that the University Center was their “number one prior­ity.”Real progress was made in 1987 when Dennis,
Clark & Associates were chosen to design the new University Center. Their design, which had more than triple the floor space available in Skibo, included a post office, a bookstore, a 600-seat cafeteria, an increased number of offices for stur dent activities, and athletic facilities including a 50-meter pool, a gymnasium, and an indoor track at a projected cost of $30 million. At that time, administration officials announced that the Capi­tal Campaign to raise funds for the University Master Plan had reached the halfway mark, $100 million. The University Center and the East Cam­pus Project are central parts of that plan.In 1988, the administration announced that the University Center’s construction could begin as soon as 1990. However, 4 months later, the Uni­versity Center's construction was delayed indefi­nitely due to a lack of donors for the needed money. By that time, in February, 1989, the Capital Cam­paign had raised $130 million, but many of the donors had earmarked their funds for other projects.

SU PA renamed
By BRENDAN MCFEELY
Tartan News Editor
The School of Urban and Public Affairs will be renamed in honor of the late Senator H. John Heinz of Pennsylvania. The new name of the school will be the H. John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management, according to a University press release.Heinz was a seven-year mem­ber of the SUPA Board of Visitors, a relationship that SUPA Dean Alfred Blumstein says was a ben­eficial one. SUPA had received generous contributions from Heinz, his father, H.J. Heinz II, from the Howard Heinz and Vera
Heinz endowments, and the H.J. Heinz Company.When asked why Heinz was cho­sen as the recipient of this honor, which is expected to take effect on July 1,1992, Blumstein replied that he thought Heinz “a terrific role model,” and espoused Heinz’s ra­tional and effective approach to public policy. Blumstein says that the school will “follow the John Heinz tradition with full concern for the important obligations that implies.” According to Blumstein, this includes avoiding taking a par­tisan political stance, and trying to remain moderate in the school’s ideology.Though SUPA is currently well
known among its peers, it suffers from not being well known in the public eye. Blumstein expects the renaming to contribute to the school’s visibility in the public sec-. tor. “There are a number of other schools named after distinguished public figures,” says Blumstein, “including the Kennedy School at Harvard.”This increase in recognition may boost the qualifications of the ap­plicant pool, giving the school a broader range of students to choose from for admission, though no sig­nificant increase in class size is expected.Heinz’s family expressed plea­sure at the delivery of the honor.
Buggy rules changed
By AARON JENKINS
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Buggy is going through some changes this year. Old items are being pinned down, pass tests are not mandatory, harness width requirements have changed, and on and on. However, there is one rule change that everyone is talk­ing about — the changes to the drivers’ roll requirements.Last year, the rules required drivers to go down the hill 10 times. This year, a distinction isbeing made between ex- ________perienced and inexperi­enced drivers. Experi­enced drivers need 10 rolls, 5 in their race day buggy, while inexperi­enced drivers now need 15 rolls, 10 in their race day buggy.The reason for therules changes is simple, ________according to Matt Adler, HHI MEMS junior and safety chair of the Sweepstakes Committee. “Last year, a lot of the [organiza­tions] came out at the very last minute and were able to qualify, but we didn’t feel [that the bug­gies! were safe. So, we stiffened the rules, hoping that this would make the organizations come out earlier.”The problem caused by the rais­ing of the roll requirements is that some drivers are not able to qualify in time for Sweepstakes. Jennifer Kerstein (senior, techni­cal writing), co-chair of buggy for Delta Tau Delta, says that the rules are not to blame. “The rules themselves are set up to be guide­lines for safety,” she says. “These are the requirements that should make a buggy safe to roll. If the driver has gone down the hill [the
required number of times] in the buggy, you know she’s safe to roll.” The problems being caused by the rule changes are not due to the new rules, .but to the weather. Buggy rolls have been canceled due to weather for most of the spring semester. There have been prob­lems with rain in previous years; last year there was bad weather during much of the spring roll time. The problem this year is that there has been consistently bad weather very close to Carnival — tradition­ally the time when most organiza-

organizations who haven't made 
as much of a commitment [by 
giving them exceptions]?”
— Matt Adler
tions scramble to complete their roll requirements.A change that occurred in the “unwritten rules” is the case-by- case examination of possible excep­tions to the roll requirements. In past years, the Sweepstakes Com­mittee has reviewed every case that came before it individually, in or­der to determine if an organization that didn’t have the number of rolls needed was still safe to race. This year, no exceptions to the rules are being made.“The organizations that do not need the exceptions are those who came out pretty consistently, who had their new buggies ready early, who were [capability tested] early, and who were ready to go,” says Adler. “On the days when we could roll, they did, and they have [quali­fied] or will. These organizations
have made a huge commitment, so why should we reward those orga­nizations who haven’t made as much of a commitment [by giving them exceptions]?”Adler admits that the no-excep­tion rule is harsh, because not all organizations need exceptions solely because of a lack of commit­ment. He contends that once an exception is made for one organi­zation, another organization wants a bigger one, and so on — a situa­tion which Adler finds unaccept­able.
____________ Another changein the rules per­tains to the buggies themselves; due to the weather, roll re­quirements for new buggies were low­ered from 10 rolls to seven.“We figured that____________ we needed to¦¦¦I [adapt] to the weather [conditions], and this seemed a good place to do it, Adler says. “The weather affects every­one universally — everyone has the same handicap.”Karl Lentz (senior, mechanical engineering), co-chair of Spirit buggy, agrees with Adler. “I think it was a good thing to do, because a lot of the teams that are competi­tive every year made new buggies, and they had them done early in the semester, but were unable to roll them soon because of the rain.”.“However,” Lentz adds, “I think, that the problem will be that a lot of teams will not be able to put the [experienced] driver... in the buggy they want. I think that the roll requirements should be lowered more because of this — keeping [requirements] high doesn’t make race day safer; it makes it worse.”

Controversial Senate budget hearings 
cause minor disputes
By GREG LEVREAULT
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Student Senate presented their budget allocations for Springl9921ast Tuesday, and quite a few groups received some surprises, not all pleas­ant. After nearly seven hours of deliberation, some organi­zations found _______________themselves givenlessthan requested. In particular,
The Thistle and the Ko­rean Student ________________Association found their budgets ‘zeroed’ overnight.The budget hearing Tues­day is a standard procedure. When an organization re­quests a subsidy from Student Senate, its officers fill out sev­eral forms for Senate Funding and Recognition Committe (F&R) perusal, and take part in individual budget hearings in front of F&R. When the bud­get is accounted for, it is pre­sented at a to the full Senate,
where the distribution of money is discussed, and any information is used as Senate “sees fit to revise the budget allocations.”
The Thistle expected a $20,000 subsidy but was left with a zeroed budget. Senate cited their lack of a constitu­tion, whichhadbeenrequested

Kathryn Coonrod, (senior, English), Editor-in-Chief of the 1992 is­sue of The Thistle, opined that the zeroing of the yearbook’s budget was planned, but with­held until the day of the bud­get hearing, behavior which Coonrod termed “unprofes­sional.”The Korean Student Asso­ciation was also denied fund­ing.

Apple sues Microsoft, HP
SAN FRANCISCO, April 1— The judge presiding over Apple Computer’s copyright infringement suit against Mi­crosoft and Hewlett-Packard set three hearings that could be a prelude to a trial of the closely watched case begin­ning as early as June.The hearings are to decide18 pretrial motions that the companies filed in recent weeks that get at the crux of the four-year-old case. As re­ported, Apple is seeking up to $5.5 billion in damages, claim­ing its two rivals used the “look and feel” of the Macin­tosh computer in competing software products, including the MS-Windows program that has become a fixture on millions of personal comput­ers. The defendants say they are protected under a 1985 license agreement withApple and because the Macintosh includes a number of unorigi­
nal or utilitarian traits.Microsoft is a software com­pany and Hewlett-Packard produces hardware. On April 13, U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker will address “the scope of copyright pro­tection” of the Macintosh and other Apple works, according to an order the judge issued yesterday. On May 12, the judge will sort out “all ques­tions of similarity” affecting the products involved in the dispute, and on June 9, the scope of damages that Apple might be able to recover.The suit is considered a bell­wether in companies’ use of the courts to vindicate alleg­edly wrongful takings of “in­tellectual property.” Most ob­servers believe it is unlikely that the case will be resolved short of a trial. Last Decem­ber, Judge Walker indicated a jury trial might begin as soon as June or July.

WASHINGTON, April 1 (DJ)— President Bush, citing a “de­fining moment in history,” an­nounced the U.S. will provide funds for a $6 billion interna­tional fund to stabilize the ruble.At a press conference, Bush, Secretary of State James Baker, and Treasury Secretary Nicho­las Brady unveiled a $24 billion package to support Russia’s move toward a market economy.The initiative is also designed to garner Congressional support for a $12 billion U.S. contribu­tion to the International Mon­etary Fund (IMF).Bush also announced an extra $1.1 billion in Commodity Credit Corporation guarantees for the purchase of U.S. agriculture products by Russia and other former Soviet republics.Of the total $24 billion pack­age being offered by the major Western nations, about $18 bil­lion is financial support to help “stabilize and restructure” the economies of Russia and the
other former Soviet republics, now known as the Common­wealth Of Independent States.Bush said that the bulk of the funding will be funneled through the international financial in­stitutions of the IMF and World Bank. Therefore, Bush said, “there’s not a lot of new money involved” in terms of outlays by the U.S. government.BushsaidtheU.S. stake would amount to about 20 percent of the full package.German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in Bonn that the West­ern industrialized nations known as the Group of Seven had agreed on the package to aid the former Soviet republics.The legislation would also re­peal “cold war” laws that cur­rently prevent U.S. companies from doing business in the former Soviet Union. It also in­cludes programs to permit U.S. businessmen and experts to go to the commonwealth to help form market-based institutions.
It further broadens a $500 mil­lion fund for helping destroy nuclear missiles to also include reactor safety, nuclear waste clean-up, and other technology concerns.Bush said that the package aims to provide all of the aid sometime in 1992 if it passes in Congress.Bush said he had sounded opinions on Capitol Hill about the intiative in meetings with Congressional leaders.Bush said that in speeches he will “simply make the case that to do nothing would be irrespon­sible. We have a personal stake— every American” in assuring the success of Russian economic reforms. The risks, according to Bush, are far greater if nothing is done to aid the CIS.Baker indicated that the $6 billion stabilization fund will be funneled through the IMF’s gen­eral agreements to borrow and therefore won’t require an extra appropriation by Congress that
would affect the U.S. budget deficit.Similarly, the bulk of the rest of the $18 billion included in the economic support package also won’t require an extra congres­sional appropriations, except for part of the $2 billion that is the U.S. share, Baker said. A large part of that amount is a $600 million grain credit for Russia, which won’t require an appro­priation, he said.Although the U.S. is prepared as of now only to contribute to a $6 billion stabilization fund for Russia, the legislation proposed by Bush envisions an eventual $3 billion U.S. total contribu­tion to stabilization funds for Russia and the other former Soviet states.On other topics, President Bush said that it is in the U.S.’s interest to “strongly” support Russian PresidentBoris Yeltsin.Bush also said that it is impor­tant for U.S. troops to remain involved in Europe.
Students fair poorly in science
I WASHINGTON, March 27 — Na- ¡tional test results show that most ¡American middle and high school ¡students have a basic understand­ing of scientific facts and principles ¡but that few are able to analyze, ¡interpret, or apply the knowledge, 
Th e Wall Street Journal reported.| At a time when U.S. businesses ¡are struggling in the global market ¡to retain their pre-eminence in sci­ence and technology, the future im­plications are grave, j The test, administered by the Na­tional Assessment for Educational ¡Progress, a federal student monitor­ing project, was given to more than 19,000 students in the fourth, eighth, and twelfth grades across the coun­try in the spring of 1990.Students were rated on four levels. The lowest level indicated a basic understanding of simple scientific principles, while the highest showed an ability to integrate specialized information to solve problems.The average score of the fourth graders fell between the first two levels; while the average score of the eighth graders fell between the sec­ond and third. The average score of the twelfth graders fell just short of
the third level, which is supposed to indicate an ability to analyze scien­tific procedures and data. A sample question at the third level asked students to show on a diagram ofthe sun and the Earth where the moon would be during a solar eclipse.At a news conference to release the test results, Education Secre­tary Lamar Alexander urged schools to place more importance on science. “We’ve put more priority on English and math, and we’ve seen results. We do not have a priority on science in this country,” he said.White students significantly out­performed black and Hispanic stu­dents on the test, and Hispanic stu­dents consistently did better than blacks. Moreover, students at paro­chial and other private schools scored better than public school students at all grades. And boys performed better than girls in the eighth and twelfth grades after matching them in the fourth grade.Alexander blamed “our cultural attitudes” for the declining scien­tific achievement by girls as they got older. “We’ve gotten in the habit of not expecting girls to learn science,” he said. “We’ve got to get over that.”

WASHINGTON, April 3—The U.S. and 26 other countries, including five from the former Soviet bloc, agreed to extend multilateral export controls to scores of civilian products that could be used to make nuclear bombs, The Wall 
Street Journal reported.The historic accord forged this week in Warsaw indicates the start of broader East-West cooperation to prevent de­veloping countries from acquiring the technology and the goods needed to construct such weapons.The Nuclear Suppliers Group, which now consists of these 27 countries, has been controlling shipments of materi­als directly associated with bomb-mak- ing since the 1970s, and the Soviet Union was an early member of the group. However, this is the first time the group has agreed to apply similar controls to a wider list of such “dual- use” items as machine tools, industrial furnaces, andlaboratory testing equip­ment. Dual-use goods are designed mainly for civilian uses but may also have some weapons-making utility.“This may be the most significant international export-control initiative since CoCom,” said a senior U.S. offi­cial. The U.S. and its allies established the Coordinating Committee on Multi­
lateral Export Controls, or CoCom, in 1949 to deny the Soviet block access to dual-use products. Now Russia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Czechoslova­kia are joining the U.S. in policing the trade in such goods.The agreement also means that U.S. exporters will no longer be at a com­petitive disadvantage through unilat­eral U.S. controls. Before the Warsaw agreement, the U.S. alone required export licenses for dual-use items on nonproliferation grounds. Under the licensing system, an exportermust iden­tify the buyer of specified products and describe how the products will be used. Nowthe other Nuclear Suppliers Group members will adopt a similar system.The Warsaw accord covers 60 dual- use goods — five short of the 65 on the U.S. list. The U.S. failed to persuade the other members to include comput­ers. However, the U.S. and Japan have a separate agreement to control the export of supercomputers, and the U.S. is urging some Western European na­tions to join this arrangement.The suppliers group’s list includes industrial equipment such as electron- beam furnaces, vibration-test equip­ment and spin-forming machines, as well as certain materials such as high-
strength aluminum, beryllium, en­riched boron, lithium, and titanium al­loys. The list also covers laser amplifi­ers and other equipment that can be used to separate uranium isotopes.At a meeting of the suppliers group in Switzerland this year, the U.S. per­suaded the other members to add elec­tromagnetic separation equipment to the list because a United Nations in­spection team had found such gear in Iraq’s nuclear facilities.The Nuclear Suppliers Group, how­ever, still lacks a permanent secretariat along the line of CoCom’s. Paul Freedenberg, a former U.S. export ad­ministrator, said its effectiveness will depend on how well its members can communicate with each other and trade relevantintelligence as CoCom has done for years. “We’ll have to see if it can acquire some teeth,” he said.U.S. officials said the Nuclear Sup­pliers Group’s members will adopt the list today but gave no details about how each member will enforce the controls.

Crime and Incident Report
3/17 DEFIANT TRESPASS,9:44 pm. A student called Cam­pus Police and said that she had just had an argument with her former boyfriend and that he was on his way to campus to “do her and himself bodily harm.” The responding officers arrived at Morewood Gardens just as a friend of the victim called Cam­pus Police and said that the per­son was in the building and ha­rassing the victim’s roommate. The victim was hiding in the friend’s room, and the officers searched E-Tower. The actor was located on the.first floor of B- Tower. He admitted that he gained entry to Morewood by showing the victim’s freshman orientation meal card. After sur­rendering the meal card, he was handcuffed and transported to the Campus Police office where he was issued a state citation for Defiant Trespass.
3/18 DEMONSTRATION, 11am to 1:30 pm. A demonstration was held outside Warner Hall. Approximately 10 to 15 people protested the CIA’s presence on campus for recruitment pur­poses. The demonstration was peaceful and no acts of civil dis­obedience were reported.
3/18 DISORDERLY CON­DUCT, 10:23 pm and 11 pm. Campus Police received an anonymous call concerning a disorderly party in Morewood Gardens. The caller also said that the participants were smok­ing marijuana. The responding officers found the party to be quite noisy, but could find no evidence of marijuana use. The participants agreed to quiet down. At 11 pm, Campus Police received another call that the party had gotten noisy. The of-
P I Z Z A
ficers spoke to one of the resi­dents of the room, who said that they were hosting the party as a celebration for a friend. He was informed that as the police had to respond twice, the party was over. The resident refused to cooperate, and the rest of the on- duty officers were summoned. The officers threatened to issue internal citations to all non-resi­dents present before the partici­pants decided to leave. The resi­dent insisted that police inter­vention was “pure bullshit,” and was issued an internal citation for hosting a disorderly party on a school night.
3/26 THEFT, 4:13 pm. An unknown person or persons stole a Macintosh Powerbook from an office in Hamburg Hall. There were no signs of forced entry. That office and another directly in sight were opened earlier that morning by the department sec­retary for a workstudy student. The student was working in the other office, in full view of the scéne, but reported seeing noth­ing unusual. The complainant stated that the workstudy did not know the department had purchased a computer. The com­puter was described as very small and light, and could easily be concealed and carried away without difficulty.

The man said that he was homeless, had no money, had not eaten for several days, and had been entering CMU buildings in order to keep warm. The man also said that he had left a state hospital two weeks before. An officer called the hos­pital and after several phone calls found that the court order confining the man to the hospi­tal had expired. Due to the man’s history and a suicide statement he made, he was transported to Western Psychiatric Institute and was committed for exami­nation and observation.

In March of 1989, students protesting the delay of the Uni­versity Center presented a peti­tion signed by over 2000 stu­dents, faculty, and staff demand­ing that the University Center be made top priority.In November of 1989, the Board of Trustees made a firm :ommitment to a $41 million University Center that would provide double the floor space of Skibo. With a $1 million private donation by CMU alumnus Tho­mas McConomy, the Capital
Campaign funds earmarked for the University Center reached $9 million.By May of1990, $27 million of the needed $41 million had been raised.In January of 1991, it was announced that the University Center would be completed in the fall of 1993. Construction was to begin with Skibo’s de­struction in November of 1991.But in 1992, with Skibo still standing, the Center was once again, and remains, delayed by a lack of donors.

Budgetary confusion 
smacks of unconcern
Last Tuesday’s Student Sen­
ate budget hearings, where Sen­
ate decided on Activities Fee al­
locations to student groups, were 
disastrous. Organizations were 
confused by the proceedings and 
offended by some Senators’ com­
ments. Senate was generally 
adversarial in response to com­
ments from the audience. The 
body was particularly harsh to­
ward organizations who were 
not present to defend their bud­
gets. The hearings exemplified 
the difficulties Senate has with 
constructive criticism and prob­
lem solving.
Apparently, few student 
groups have a complete under­
standing of the budget hearings 
or of how to prepare an initial 
budget. Senate needs to realize 
that organizations aren’t neces­
sarily aware of their funding 
status, or how it concerns their 
budgets. The Funding and Rec­
ognition committee (F&R) needs 
to guide organizations through 
the process and give them more 
help than a few office hours held 
the afternoon of the meeting.
The lack of representation at 
the meetingindicates that orga­
nizations were unaware either 
of the meeting or its purpose, 
not necessarily that they didn’t 
care, as many Senators as­
sumed. We doubt groups would 
have skipped the meetingif they 
had known its importance. The 
ad in The Tartan concerning the 
budgets was not eye-catching 
and didn’t make the date or time 
of the meeting prominent. It also 
didn’t stress that groups should 
send a representative.
Particularly, people may not 
have been aware that the bud­
gets presented by F&R were not 
final; Senate, as a whole, must 
vote on the budget package, and 
it inevitably changes some of 
the budgets — with or without 
input from the organizations 
affected.
To mitigate the confusion, F&R 
should send letters out to the 
organizations approximately a 
week before the full Senate bud­
get hearing to remind them of 
the purpose and importance of 
the meeting. Senate cannot rely 
on text-heavy ads in The Tartan 
or memories of a notice sent two 
months in advance.
The letter should include a 
copy of the organization’s bud­
get as it will be presented to 
Senate, reasons for any changes, 
and a clear statement that the 
budget can be further adjusted 
during the hearing. Senate 
should require each group to 
send a representative who 
knows the details of its budget, 
and must stress the possible 
implications of the hearings to 
each organization.
Most groups seem to have poor 
relationships with F&R. Groups 
go into the hearings fighting for 
money; F&R gives the impres­
sion that it’s looking for as many 
reasons as possible not to give it 
to them. Obviously funding must 
be limited so that there is enough 
money to go around, but F&R 
needs to back up its decisions 
with policy, precedence, and 
numbers.
Some Senators behaved atro­
ciously during the meeting, and
their actions prove that Senate 
needs to review itself, its ethics, 
its goals, and its methods of 
reaching them.
When reviewing its own bud­
get, Senate discussed retreats 
at length. Notably, there was an 
absence of discussion about the 
fact that Senate itself subsidizes 
its entire budget. Despite the 
fact that many Senators were 
harping all night about how or­
ganizations need to raise some 
money and not rely solely on the 
Activities Fee, no Senators even 
asked if Senate should raise 
some of its own funds.
The response Senator Joshua 
Knauer (H&SS) gave when a 
member of the audience asked 
why Senate does no fundraising, 
that Senate could just raise the 
Activities Fee because that’s 
where Senate gets its money, 
did not answer the question 
posed, was rude, and only served 
to make Senate look more ri­
diculous. Contrary to what 
Knauer seems to believe, the 
Activities Fee is not Senate’s 
money, but the students’; Sen­
ate is merely the instrument by 
which the Fee is distributed to 
serve the needs of the student 
body.
The lack of effective checks 
and balances on Student Senate 
is troublesome, and was evident 
as Senate alone reviewed its own 
budget. StudentBody President­
elect Natalie Gesmond, in her 
plans to reconstruct Student 
Government, must add checks 
and balances on Senate, and 
exercise the one check that ex­
ists — the president’s veto 
power. As the situation stands, 
Senate does whatever it wants, 
and no one can do anything about 
it.
A case in point is the comment 
Senator Michael Loomis (GSIA) 
made that Senate can refuse to 
fund a group for “having the 
letter Q in its name.” Even 
though Loomis was making a 
point, his flippant comment did 
nothing to lend credence to his 
opinion. Loomis made Senate 
once again seem arbitrary and 
unresponsive to the student 
body.
Knauer and Loomis’s displays 
are examples of a general atti­
tude that seems to pervade Sen­
ate. As a body, Senate does not 
display concern or consideration 
for individual students.
When audience members 
speak to criticize Senate, some 
Senators roll their eyes. Such a 
lack of professionalism has no 
place in a governing body. Sena­
tors must stop giving the im­
pression that they don’t give a 
damn about what students want 
from government.
Senate has to realize that its 
prime responsibility is to the 
students of CMU. We do not 
elect our Senators to sit at their 
tables and make snide com­
ments when we ask for consid­
eration.
Senate must be more recep­
tive to criticism and more ap­
proachable, less antagonistic. 
Senators: don’t forget your re­
sponsibility to serve the stu­
dents. Any government that does 
not meet the needs of its con­
stituents is pointless.
Pro-life supporter argues 
with columinst’s logic
Editor:In response to Rich Robinson’s column [“TV ads mislead viewers on adoption,”3/16], I would like to explain the underlyinglogic behind the pro-life movement. For starters, our logic is not based on a “religious convic­tion,” rather it incorporates what sci­ence has taught us about human life and what history has taught us about the needs of a nation to survive.Robinson states, “Science has proven that it [abortion] is not killing.” This inaccuracy is prevalent among the pro­abortion movement. Science is system- ized knowledge derived from observa­tion. Observations of the sperm and the egg tell us that a dramatic change occurs when the two unite to form a complete human cell. After this point there is no other defining change to this tiny human being. The baby’s life is now in a continuum with only oxygen and nutrition being added by the baby’s mother. However, if Robinson would care to enlighten the scientific commu­nity by providing new scientific evi­dence which proves that human life begins at another point (two months, eight months, or one year after birth), I ask him to present it now.Robinson further states that the baby in the first trimester is nothing but “a bundle of cells.” This materialistic out­look rejects that human life is a con­tinuum. Using his argument, we can assign an arbitrary date at which we should begin to recognize human life. For example, I could easily say that babies under two are nothing but worth­less bundles of cells. Wouldn’t it be easier to dispose of defective babies once we have seen them behave for a while?Robinson should remember that both blacks and Jews were not considered human beings at one point in history. He should realize that the argument for abortion makes the same mistake.
Pat Mooney Sophomore, H&SS
Anti-abortion supporter 
clarifies movement views
Editor:Since Rich Robin­son has now allied himself with the pro­abortion movement by helping to spread the numerous falsehoods told about the pro-life movement [“TV ads mislead viewers on adoption,” 3/16], perhaps he would care to learn the real arguments against abortion. The intent of this letter is to expose one of the true hor­rors of abortion, a side Robinson failed to mention in his article, the effects on the mother.Abortion is more than the killing of a baby, it is the rejection of nature, moth­erhood and fatherhood, and the family. There can be no doubt that many moth­ers who have aborted have suffered an untold amount of emotional trauma after having an abortion.An interview in the August 3, 1983 edition of The Washington Times with
Nancyjo Mann, the founder of Women Exploited By Abortion (WEBA), de­tails the other numerous after effects of abortion. The article states, “One psychological effect we see almost all the time is guilt. Others are suicidal impulses, a sense of loss, of unful- fillment. Mourning, regret and remorse. Withdrawal, loss of confidence in deci- sion-making capabilities.... Lowering of self esteem. Preoccupation with death. Hostilities, self destructive be­havior, anger and rage. You can lose your temper very quickly. A despair, helplessness, desire to remember the death date.... You remember these dates very strongly.”The article continues with more psy­chological effects, “Lack of desire to enter into a relationship with a part­ner, loss of interest in sex, an inability to forgive self, feeling of dehumaniza­tion, nightmares, seizures and trem­ors, frustrations, feelings of being ex­ploited. And child abuse. We see a lot of child abuse.”Perhaps Robinson should reconsider his statement that, “If pregnant women are not given the choice to have an abortion, they are faced with the disin­tegration of their lives.” It is clear that abortion disintegrates the lives of the baby and the mother. Adoption en­hances the lives of the baby, the adop­tive parents, and the birth mother.

Editor:The recent Student Senate resolution calling for the re­moval of ROTC from CMU has provoked a strong debate about democracy on this campus, and some people worry whether or not Student Senate has listened to the student body’s opinion in the referendum. A few of the people who wanted to banish flag burning on this campus two years ago are now crying about “dictatorship” and oppres­sion; apparently the irony doesn’t bother them.Apparently, only 8 percent of all stu­dents voted last fall in Student Senate elections. In the recent referendum, 22.7 percent voted. Most of the stu­dents who made up this 22.7 percent obviously did not vote in the Student Senate elections; evidently they gave up their right to be represented by Student Senate and did not care to influence who sits on Senate. Success­ful politicians will heed the ideas of those who actually vote in elections and pay less attention to those who don’t vote. Most of the 22.7 percent who turned down the resolution have shown a pattern of not voting.Of course, this issue could have a durable effect on the 22.7 percent who voted in the referendum. Perhaps they will start taking an interest in campus politics and begin voting in elections, and they certainly may remove the sena­tors who support the resolution. If that happens, then the students of CMU will have begun a participation in de­mocracy not seen in years on this cam­pus. Either way, democracy will pre­
vail and Senate will be filled by those with a long-lasting commitment to par­ticipation in democracy. To cry “dicta­torship” when elections are held regu­larly and quite often (I think every year) is a spurious argument.Ideally, Senatemade an opinion based on what policy would reduce the num­ber of those discriminated against in the long run. Perhaps if nobody on campus in America could get a ROTC scholarship for a few years, then the DoD will be spurred to admit gays years before they would have otherwise. If the DoD opened up to homosexuals quickly enough, the net result would be fewer people wrongly denied ROTC scholarships. Or perhaps not. This is­sue will not die for some time. Those who care that thousands of Americans are denied from patriotically serving their country on a full time basis should decide on the best method to remove discrimination from our armed forces, and then press forward with their goals.

Editor:I have a serious concern and believe that this is the only way to try to remedy it. This letter is in response to the Greek Sing reviews that appeared in the March 16 Tartan [“Greek Sing wows audience with col­orful performances,”4/16], Specifically, I am referring to Chi Omega’s review.Greek Sing is a charity event, and Greeks participate in it because it’s fun and makes us feel good to be doing something for the community. Putting on a Broadway show is not the purpose of it. All of the organizations work very hard and put a lot of effort into per­forming a good show. Besides the fun, the spirit of competition drives us to take our performance seriously.Sure, we didn’t place, but we put on a good show. We were well received by the audience, and I felt good about what I had done — until I read the review. There was a very negative tone to the review that appeared to be pur­posefully degrading. Who gives you the right to cause me to change the opinion I hold of myself?The other reviews were simply that— reviews. There was no mention of errors that were made simply because of human error, and no personal slams were made, other than in ours. In one review The Tartan even contributed the lack of projection to nervousness. Why didn’t we receive the same benefit of the doubt? I was proud of our perfor­mance and feel slighted by the attack made by The Tartan. What wasn’t The Tartan’s purpose when they conducted such a malicious attack on our house? People who were not able to attend assumed that The Tartan accurately reported the show. Therefore, this re­view misrepresented our performance.I was very disturbed and hurt by what I read and the fact that The Tar­tan sees what they wrote as simply “a review” upsets me even further.

Strike leaves pets as transportation
' iBaof uglofBny
Before the recent PAT bus strike, buses were always evil things to me.They were the things I always got stuck behind while driving to campus. On the occasional day I had to actually make use of public transit, they were over­crowded with the most unusual people on the face of the earth. That, and they religiously showed up late.Hard to believe I’d ever miss them, but I do. As one of the few, the proud, the commuters, I’ve watched my existence become increasingly muddled in the last three weeks. I find myself burn­
ing random household objects as offerings to the Gods of Mass Transit, hoping it will appease them and get buses back on the road.I wish I could pretend I was concerned about my academic slippage — after all, the bus strike has caused me to miss three or four complete days of class—but let’s be serious. With only a month left in my aca­demic career, skipping classes has become standard operating procedure.The problem is more with the Achilles heel this strike has re­vealed.Wheneverthe car wasn’t avail­able, I used to have the safety net of public transit. Now when I’m strapped for transportation, I have to beg and plead just like everyone else. I’m up to my ears in favors to other people with
cars, and it’s probably going to get worse.But why am I having such trouble getting that broken- down car?It’s all because of the McDon­ald Brothers’ War of the Car. Fueled by the urgency of the bus strike, my older sibling and I have started a truly cut-throat battle for vehicular superiority.My brother and I have always had an adversarial relationship when it came to sharing the car. Standard brotherly loveincluded running the gas tank as low as possible so that the other one would have to pay to refill it, depleting the supply of parking meter change, and swiping all the good tapes. But that was kid stuff compared to our strike-time tactics.Now the really dirty pool starts. Since our schedules don’t
mesh very well, every day be­comes a winner-take-all race to see who can make it out of the house first.The winner is mobile for the day, while the loser gets to stay home and watch bad television. Being a rather sound sleeper, I usually end up losing this par­ticular game.Even on the few days that Jon and I call truce and schedule in advance, things are hectic. Usu­ally one or the other of us ends up waiting for a couple of hours while the other goes to class. While it was still snowing, I even considered hooking our dog, Sam, up to a sled to get to cam­pus. Unfortunately, I doubt that cocker spaniels get very good mileage.All this trouble just because of a bus strike. Being megaloma- niacal at heart, I don’t care about
the right and wrong of the situ­ation; I just want my 61B back.The worst thing about all of this is that, when the bus driv­ers do go back to work, PAT fares will almost surely be higher.A friend of the family who works for the city told me that unions almost always get what they want when they go to third- party arbitration.This means a pay raise, which will no doubt mean yet another rate hike.Hmm. No buses at all, or buses that cost so much that you’d rather walk. Maybe I will hook Sam up to the sled.

It is often said that knowledge is power. But there is a growing trend in this coun­try — a war to censor the spread of some types of knowledge.One of the prime movers in this war is the religious right — people who are trying to legislate morality. Several years ago, Reverend Donald Wildmon was quite disgusted by what he saw on TV. Instead of shrugging his shoulders and turning the TV off, he decided to campaign against the offending programs. Some of the pro­grams he dislikes areALF, Cheers, High­
way to Heaven, 60 Minutes, LA Law, 
Golden Girls, Mr. Belvedere, and Father 
Dowling Mysteries. He claims these shows are offensive, some obscene, and that they will corrupt our youth into who- knows-what perversity.The scary part is how successful he’s been at gaining attention. He claims to be advocating “family values,” but in reality he’s campaigning to impose his morality on you. And there are many others like him, some acting in the government.The National Obscenity Enforcement Unit (NOEU) harassed a Connecticut- based movie distributor which sold X- rated movies. The firm was actively threatened with enormous legal defense
fees unless it capitulated. During non- search-warranted raids, employees were harassed and questioned without an at­torney present — they were told they could not refuse these questionings. Desks and purses were opened, and per­sonal materials were seized. In pressing the case, NOEU used the fact that people in Virginia, North Carolina, and Ala­bama (places where the firm had sold movies) found the films to violate their local community standards.Yet a North Carolina jury acquitted the firm in five minutes, showing how ludicrous the charges actually were.This still sets a dangerous precedent. It means that the most repressive com­munity standards can be used in the most liberal of places.If a film offends in Salt Lake City, then by God, shut it down in Pittsburgh! If this persecution happens now, what will happen if S. 1521, the Pornography Victim’s Compensation Act, is passed?This bill would allow victims to sue the authors, publishers, and distributors of any material deemed to have provoked a criminal offender’s actions. Beyond the legal culpability problems of removing the perpetrator’s responsibility by turn­ing him or her into a pomography-ma- nipulated robot, there is the hidden aim of closing down the sources of these ma­terials by threatening their pocketbooks. This is the real intent of the law — to shut down these expressions which some
deem morally offensive.Nobody is immune. Library copies of 
Playboy have been protested by many religious righters. Catcher in the Rye, the archetypical defiance-of-authority story, is often the number one book on hit lists — along with 1984, The Color Purple, and many other books which these cen­sors believe to promote whatever evil they are obsessed with. Remember the furor over the Mapplethorpe photo­graphs? The pressure on artists to con­form is still there.There is also “economic censorship” which investigative reporters are now feeling. As reported in the Fall 1990 
Investigative Reporters and Editors Jour­
nal, “Stories are being killed... watered- down ... [and] not even attempted be­cause ... they’ll never make it on the air.”For example, real estate advertising accounts for 18.5 percent of all newspa­per classified ads, yet rarely will a paper assign a tough reporter to this beat. A 
Washington Journalism Review survey of 42 real estate editors found that al­
most half had their superiors prohibit critical coverage for fear of offending advertisers!This is especially frightening since housing is the average family’s biggest investment.Or consider the Gannett newspaper chain. It sent a memo to its editors sug­gesting that they emphasize coverage of trends and sales, while lessening cover-
age of local government, so as to boost circulation and, one presumes, advertis­ing revenue.What of Newsweek, whose February 1988 cover story “What You Should Know About Heart Attacks” had no references to smoking hazards.Or the Time representative who said, “Time... has a lot of cigarette advertising. Do you carry material that’s insulting to your advertiser?” What about The New 
Republic editor who killed a story on the ill effects of smoking fearing “massive losses of advertising revenue.” These are journalistic ethics violations of the first magnitude.There are many people who want to censor your access to information—some because they want to impose their moral­ity on you, others for more mundane, financially manipulative reasons.Take action, speak up, or before you know it everything you read, every movie you see, and every song you hear will be sanitized.The examples I’ve given are the tip of the iceberg, and come from magazines like Playboy, Free Inquiry, and In These 
Times.If the censors had their way just five years ago, I wouldn’t even have had the knowledge to write this. And that should frighten you all.

The entire article is unnecessar­ily critical and unfair to almost everyone who participated. Com­ments like, “couldn’t they have looked a little less thrown to­gether,” “a nice change of pace from the often tuneless voices we’d been subjected to ...,” “the sets ... were not too special ...” “the sisters and pledges tried hard ... but were not particu­larly impressive,” and “better luck next year,” do not reflect the spirit of Greek Sing and are completely unnecessary. Greek sing is a charity event (an im­portant fact The Tartan failed to include), not a Broadway show. Everyone involved put forth a tremendous effort and deserves a lot of credit for making this year’s Greek Sing better than ever.

(broken promises),” are the maxi slogans of the day. Meanwhile the hard decisions are not being made! Those running for Presi­dent and Congress are holding America hostage while the dia­tribe continues.Defining the formula for re­storing economic sanity to our system is not all that difficult. The apparent impossible task is implementation due to a gross lack of leadership and true sense of caring by Congress that has disappeared.Consider this: The federal gov­ernment borrows one dollar in every four that it spends. The interest alone on the federal debt represents 15 percent of all fed­eral spending, and nearly 50 percent of the GNP.We are speaking of debt ser­vice only. Not one cent of that payment goes toward reducing the debt.The current federal tax code covers more than 4000 pages, and includes some 200 major personal and business loopholes resulting in over $350 billion in lost revenue annually. There are over 90,000 profitable busi­nesses not now paying income taxes due to these loopholes.Compare the lost revenue ($350 billion) with the yearly deficit ($400 billion). Kind of says it all!
The ideal taxing system would have six principles:1. Taxes would produce only that revenue which is necessary for the government to function efficiently and effectively;2. Treats all in a fair manner;3. Offers the least discomfort for the greatest number of tax­payers;4. Offers the least amount of complications;5. Encourages savings and de­velopment of equity in the pri­vate market;6. Promotes economic growth and encourages business deci­sions to be based on economics, not tax gimmicks. Our present system fails in all of the above categories.Targeting tax and spending reforms over the next 3 years with, say, a ratio of 25 percent of the deficit being resolved by spending cuts, and 75 percent from new revenue (not tax rate increases) from the erosion of loopholes gradually phased out would send the proper signals that we are serious of winning the war for economic recovery. New revenue should be dedi­cated to reducing the deficit and national debt, and not a penny for new spending.Erstwhile opponents will come to realize, in the long run, this kind of reform movement will build a stronger and expanding economy where all will benefit, and not just a few as has been the case.Let the candidates hear your voice.

Public works remedy 
economic woes
onEditor:Maryland’s Governor,wiiiiam Don- Letter toaid Schaefer, has done it Ithe Editor
again!He has plotted three noble goals with a single stroke of a pen. To wit: Addressing our de­teriorated inner-structure (roads and bridges); putting people back to work; and fueling the engines for economic recov­ery in Maryland.He has done this by mandat­ing the acceleration of contracts for public works already appro­priated — over $80 million — and seeking necessary local leg­islation to qualify for matching funds over the next six years — over $2 billion — from the re­cently passed federal legislation, the Inter-modal Surface Trans­portation Efficiency Act.The Inter-modal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act could provide over $150 billion to all the states, resulting in over 600,000 new jobs this year, and over 4 million during the life of the bill.Maryland and our nation have billions of dollars worth of long overdue public works needs plus the need for new schools and hospitals have yet to be ad­dressed.When people go back to work, they up-grade their standard of living (by spending for) new apartments, home ownership, autos, trucks, clothes, etc.Home building and the auto-
motive industries are the bed­rock of our nation’s economy.Consider just a few of the in­dustries that support housing and autos: lumber, cement, ma­sonry, steel, glass, rubber, plas­tics, heavy equipment, copper, sheet-metal, die casting, alumi­num, furniture, trucking, auto repair shops and heating, air- conditioning, plumbing, and elec­trical manufacturer’s and ven­dors.Thousands of small and me­dium size businesses make up this support base.Now consider the millions of more unemployed that can go back to work due to the indirect impact.Many contractors that have remained apart from public works in the past might well consider diversifying into this growing market.There are many experienced mechanics, laborers, superin­tendants, and project managers now out of work that, when brought on board, can bring in­stant experience to an otherwise unqualified company.The other states should follow Schaefer’s example of matching available local dollars with the federal program and cutting through the red tape to acceler­ate getting people back to work ... now!We need someone at the helm in Washington that understands the needs of labor and coordi­nates the proper mix of economic revitalization with regional, state, and local needs.

Justice reforms alter appeal process
hdEeaseBf u— 7Rasepo
The justice system of the United States is a prime example of Newton’s second law of motion. Objects at rest tend to stay at rest, and objects in motion tend to keep moving. What I mean by this is the following. First, the justice system is a slow monolith, often endlessly crushing and grinding people in its attempt to deal with the millions of cases without the resources to do it. Second, change comes to the justice system only with a great deal of litiga­tion, debate, and endless strife.For these reasons, I used to hate people who appealed every decision, for even the smallest technicality. While you do have the right to an appeal, appealing for a mistrial because a cop got a little excited and twisted your arm a little too much is a waste of time and resources. In short, it is an abuse of the system. I would often read about criminals making these appeals, and my blood would boil. They are going to abuse the system so much, I used to think, that there’s going to be a back­lash and innocent people are going to be jailed or even sentenced to death.Well, my forboding proved true. I had read the reports about the Supreme Court making appeals more difficult,
and I was glad. Sort of. I was glad until I read the current edition of Newsweek and found out how the system is liter­ally playing life and death with a man who may very well be innocent.Ten years ago, Roger Coleman was convicted of the murder of Wendy McCoy in Grundy, Virginia. She was raped, her throat was slit, and she was stabbed in the chest. After a three-day trial, Coleman was convicted and sen­tenced to death. He tried to appeal through the state but lost. He was de­nied a federal court appeal, because his lawyers were one day late in filing. In other words, a man sentenced to death 
was denied an appeal because his law­
yers, not he, filed 24 hours late.The denial is a frightening situation in and of itself. What’s worse, however, is that recent Supreme Court rulings have made appeals based on new evi­dence much harder to acquire. The high court did agree to hear the case of Leonel Herrera, convicted of killing two police officers, but the Justices were one vote short of the number needed for a stay of execution. In other words, you can get an appeal, but if your execution date is before the appeal date, you might still be put to death. Luckily, a Texas state court had the wisdom and com­mon sense to grant a stay of execution. However, things are not that great for Herrera. He’s set to be executed in April when his court date is in October. He claims there is evidence that his brother, who died in 1984, confessed to
the killings.Of course, I would have little sympa­thy for Coleman if his appeal were based on some obscure technicality. However, there is a good deal of new evidence that casts more than a rea­sonable doubt on his guilt. Last year, Teresa Horn came forward with an affidavit stating that another man, Donney Ramey, confessed to her that
he was the one who killed McCoy. She also said that Ramey attempted to rape her four years earlier. Horn partici­pated in an interview, but was later found dead due to “drug overdose.” Authorities don’t believe there was foul play, but I find the timing of it all hard to swallow.Regardless of the fact that Horn’s affidavit may not be admissible in court because she cannot be cross-examined, the conviction of Coleman itself rests on sh,aky evidence. According to 
Newsweek, Coleman’s three-inch knife was supposedly the murder weapon, but there were two four-inch-deep stab wounds in McCoy’s body. There was no forced entry, but how does this explain the fact that there was a pry mark on
McCoy’s front door? Coleman was a likely suspect, because he was the only person who could get into the house.Coleman was linked to McCoy via blood samples taken from her body, but a good number of people in Grundy have the same blood type as Coleman. The semen of two different men was found in McCoy’s vagina, and an infor­mant confessed that he made up
Coleman’s confession to him that Coleman was responsible for McCoy’s death.I don’t know about you, but all this sounds like a great deal like circum­stantial evidence. Even if a case could be made that no appeal should be al­lowed because of the nature of the evi­dence, the fact that someone might have known who the real killer is should be grounds for a retrial. Meanwhile, Coleman is waiting. His date of execu­tion is May 20, and so far, no one has granted any stay of execution. In a little over a month, it’s possible that an inno­cent man may be sent to his death.Although I support the death pen­alty, I think the Supreme Court is play­ing a dangerous game with the lives of
people. First, the admission of new evidence that may exonerate a con­victed person or prove previous evi­dence wrong must be grounds for an appeal — without exception. Convicts must be allowed an appeal even if their lawyers file late. Although there exists the possibility that some people may use this idea to abuse the system, we cannot punish convicts or deny them their rights simply because their law­yers failed to perform their duties.Lastly, we must do away with things like the Virginia state law that says new evidence for an appeal must be brought forward within 21 days of con­viction. Statutes of limitation should exist for prosecutions, not appeals. I should not have to go to jail or my death, because an appeal was denied on the account of someone else’s being afraid to speak up within a short period of time.There is an old adage that says it is better that ten guilty men go free than for one innocent man to go to jail. While you can at least attempt to compensate someone for years spent in jail for a wrong conviction, it is impossible to bring back the dead. The Supreme Court should realize that its current set of decisions is setting the scene for the death of innocent people. Sooner or later, it will be called to answer for its actions.
Christian M. Restifo is a junior chemi­
cal engineering major.

SPORTS
Shootout brings competition
PRESS PASS
by Jason McDonald
Don’t touch 
that dial
Spring break was just awful this year. Not only did my plan to go to Penn State fall through, but I ended up getting sick. With no means of leaving the house, I amused myself in the only way possible ... televised sports.There were, of course, some bright spots on the dial. The NCAA tournament (men’s and women’s) and spring training baseball provided several hours of pleasant diversion. Until the NHL strike, I was enjoying the fact that my cable company finally rolled over and gave us access to SportsChannel, which owns the rights to NHL games. But the rest....First of all, Wrestlemania VIII is upon us. I know this is the loosest application of the word “sport,” but the amount of hype for the event made it stick in my head as much as any real sport. Not that we ever needed the first seven Wrestlemanias, but some morons are willing to pay for this stuff. I guess P.T. Bamum was right.Equally fascinating, if only slightly more legitimate, is the lumbeijack contest. Some smart exec at ESPN said, “I’ve got a great idea for a sport!Let’s take twenty guys with chain saws and flannel shirts, and let them do their thing for money.” Not only was this character not fired, but was probably promoted to vice- president on the spot.I also watched my first televised game of pool. It was refreshing because I never thought any sport could be rendered in more boring fashion than bowling and golf.I was wrong — pool on TV is about as exciting as watching paint dry. Sorry, but two lethargic fat men in bad suits don’t make for high drama unless they’re armed with pistols.There was also sailing galore. Sailing isn’t that bad a sport; they just need a lot more camera angles. Either you’re going to be seeing the on-boat view or the overhead shot.Also, there’s no crowd shots to break the action.If you were having fun in the sun somewhere, you also missed Australian rules football, a staple in the early days of ESPN. For those who have never seen the sport, it’s like someone asked humans to simulate a pit bull attack. You get the feeling the ball was just put in the game by acci­dent.At least mildly related to sports, HBO offered up its annual “Making of the Sports 
Illustrated Swimsuit Issue” show, where they force-feed us shots of Kathy Ireland reading Kierkegaard (while in swim­suit, of course) to show the depth of her soul. Inevitably, the only thing HBO proves is that they have as much good taste as bread mold. Especially the night they made it their 8 pm prime-time feature.There was more to see, but most of it didn’t leave much an impression. I’m just going to make sure I have plenty of baseball videotaped so I don’t have to watch any pool next time I’m home sick.

Carnegie Mellon University played hosttonine other lacrosse teams for the second annual Pittsburgh Lacrosse Shootout last weekend. The field of com­petition came from all over. CMU, the University of Pitts­burgh, and the Pittsburgh La­crosse Club (PLC) were the local teams at the tournament. Also present were the University of Michigan, the University of Buf­falo, Fordham University, Bowl­ing Green, Ohio State Univer­sity, Virginia Tech, and John Carroll University. The Pitts­burgh Lacrosse Club won the Shootout last year and were look­ing to repeat. But, Buffalo and Pitt weren’t there just to sit and watch.The tournament began at Pitt Stadium Friday evening, with co-host Pitt taking on John Carroll. Pitt took the game eas­ily, 11-2. Two games followed at Pitt Stadium. Bowling Greenlost to the Pittsburgh Lacrosse Club 9-1 and Fordham proved their worth by overpowering Virginia Tech 12-3.At the Gesling Stadium tour­nament opener, CMU hosted the University of Michigan in cold and breezy weather. The game was tight throughout the first half. The first quarter ended with Michigan up 1-0. In the second quarter, with less than two min­utes before halflime, Chris Flynn made a pass to senior Todd Bred- benner, who scored the tying goal.The third quarter, however, belonged to Michigan. The Wol­verines scored four goals before the quarter’s end, and added one more early in the fourth for a 6— 1 victory.Buffalo took on Ohio State af-

terward, and won handily 16-6.The games began again early Saturday morning at Gesling, with PLC beating John Carroll 14-1. Buffalo smashed Bowling Green 18-1. CMU encountered Fordham in the third Gesling game. CMU jumped ahead early with a goal from John Seekings, but Fordham countered and took a 2—1 lead going into the second quarter. Seekings showed his face again with an assist to graduate student Bayard John­son for the tying goal. But Fordham countered the single CMU goal with a pair of their own, taking a 4-2 lead into half- time.Early in the third quarter, Fordham scored another goal for a 5—2 lead. Johnson scored an­other goal, with an assist from Bredbenner to end the third quarter. Fordham put another one in the net to start the fourth.

Then CMU’s defense kicked in, creating groundballs that they recovered. Bredbenner found the goal with an assist from fresh­man Travis Warren with four minutes to play in the game. With just under two minutes left, Warren had another assist, this one to Flynn to close the score to a one-point spread. The CMU offense fired every shot they could at the goal, and with 15 seconds remaining went to a one man advantage. Despite the advantage, they were unable to score, and lost 6-5.Following the CMU game, Michigan beat Virginia Tech, 9- 4. Pitt pounded Ohio State, 11- 2. Michigan took the field again just two hours later against tough and hungry Fordham. Michigan handled Fordham for three and a half quarters. Fordham came back from a 3- point deficit to tie the game with

10 seconds left. Into double over­time, the game looked as if it would be called a tie. Fordham would not settle for that. With 15 seconds to play in the game, Fordham won the most exciting game of the tournament to that point.CMU took the field again; this time their opponent was winless Ohio State. Warren scored first for CMU in the first quarter, but Ohio State came back to steal the lead.The second quarter belonged to Carnegie Mellon. Warren scored again to tie the game at two. Ohio State scored back-to- back goals to take a 4-2 lead. Flynn scored off the assist from Warren. Sophomore Daniel Afirick scored the tying goal with the assist from Bredbenner. As time ran out in the half, Bredbenner scored to bring CMU ahead with an assist from senior
Steve Ramey. But, Ohio State « scored four unanswered goals in j the second half to win 8-5. At Pitt Stadium, Buffalo trounced ; John Carroll 19-2. Pitt beat 1 Bowling Green 13-2, and PLC ' lost to Virginia Tech 8—7 to end ] Saturday’s deluge of lacrosse. ¦Early Sunday morning, the : games began again, with the j lower bracket semifinal games ! taking place.The top four point-scoring ! teams were placedinto a bracket, , and the second four were put \ into a playoff bracket, leaving ; two teams, John Carroll and : Bowling Green, out. At Gesling, fifth-ranked Michigan took on an injured and benchless CMU, and beat them 9-0. Meanwhile ¦> at Pitt, Virginia Tech beat eighth-ranked Ohio State 14-5. : Virginia Tech and Michigan faced one another for a second ; time. This time the secondary ; trophy was in question. The ; score, 9—4, was the same as their first game, but the outcome was quite different, as Virginia went home with the B bracket trophy.In the A bracket, first place Buffalo pounded PLC 16-1 at Gesling, while Pitt beat Ford­ham at Pitt 10-6. And so, the only teams to go through the tournament without losing any quarters faced off at Gesling for the winners’trophy. In a struggle between the two giants,Pitt won the tournament trophybeating Buffalo in overtime 10-9.On the tournament, coordina­tor and Carnegie Mellon senior captain Peter Vonderlieth said, “We went into the tournament missing a lot of guys. There were 10 players who couldn’t play. Our performance overall wasn’t very good, but we played well - defensively throughout the tour­nament; we just didn’t have the players to score the points.”

The Carnegie Mellon Crew club trav­eled to Baltimore, MD last Saturday to compete in the Johns Hopkins Regatta. CMU sent nine crews to their first meet of the season: a men’s and a women’s var­sity pair, a men’s lightweight four with a coxswain, two women’s varsity fours with coxswains, a men’s varsity four with a coxswain, a men’s varsity eight with a coxswain, and a women’s and a men’s novice four with coxswains.There were 18 teams at the regatta. Carnegie Mellon competed against some local teams like Pitt, Duquesne, and Carlow College, as well as teams from Washington College, Johns Hopkins, Maritime, Stockton, La Salle, Lehigh, Mary Washington, Charleston, George Washington, Loyola, Old Dominion, St. Johns, Susquehana, and Catholic Uni­versity.The competition started at 8 am. The
weather was chilly, but for the most part “the water was cooperative,” said junior Sarah Gibby. Races were planned to be 2000-meter sprints.Senior Anna Loney and junior Opal Perry rowed the 2000 meters in 10:22 and won a gold in the women’s varsity pairs competition.The men’s varsity pair, senior Shawn Omler and sophomore Mark Vanan- twerp, took second place in the competi­tion with a time of 8:10.Carnegie Mellon entered two crews in the women’s varsity fours competition. Carnegie Mellon graduates Dori Mar­tin, Susan Englert, and Carla Isenberg rowed with freshman Amy Lefkowitz as Team B. With coxswain sophomore Ruth Rasmussen, Team B finished eighth out of 11 with a time of 9:23.06.Team A’s coxswain, junior Kim McCormick, led Loney, Perry, Gibby, and fifth year senior Lisa Johnson to a seventh-place finish out of 11 teams. Team A rowed the 2000-meter sprint in
9:10.15Omler, Vanantwerp, and Carnegie Mellon graduates Randy Simmons and Chris Fetter competed in the men’s var­sity fours race with coxswain junior Dexter Kobayashi. With a time of 8:05.4, the crew beat out seven other teams to take sixth place.With Perry as coxswain, the men’s varsity eight crew finished the race in 7:40.12, coming in last. The crew con­sisted of CMU graduates Simmons, Fet­ter, DarrellKauric, and Cory Kosak along with freshmen John Pasewicz, Matt Jezyk, Chris Maples, and Kevin Luczkow.Luczkow, Jezyk, Pasewicz, and Maples also raced in the men’s novice fours com­petition. Led by coxswain freshman Corky Kamei, they finished last in 10:31.By the time the women’s novice four and men’s lightweight four competitions rolled around, the water has become so rocky, and the boats so unstable, that the original 2000-meter sprint was cut in half.
The women’s novice four crew consisted of Johnson, Gibby, junior Beth Ward, and freshman Karen Knepper.Perry coxed the novice four team to a seventh-place finish, beating four other teams in the 1000-meter sprint with a time of just over six minutes.Seniors Peter Blossey, Dan Fiore, and Dave Shin, with fifth year scholar Chuck Hachten, rowed the 1000 meters as a men’s lightweight four crew. Coxed by McCormick, they finished second with a time of 4:37.8.Travelingbackfrom Baltimore, the team was stuck in a snow storm, but, Gibby • said, “a good time was had by all.”“I think that racing in our first regatta 1 of the Spring season allowed us to see ( where we stand overall and what im- ; provements we might each make in order • to be more competitive in the upcoming j regattas,” Gibby said.Next weekend the crew team will be j traveling to Charleston, W.Va. to compete j in the Governor’s Cup Regatta.

In a field of 26, CMU’s team consisted of five riders. Only one managed to break the top five on the 24-mile course. Sophomore Chris McGee took a huge lead near the end of the fourth and final lap. As he came around the final turn, his lead diminished, as did some of his momentum. McGee led the sprint to the finish line, but two other racers closed in quickly.During the last 30 feet of the race, the two other racers, one from IUP, the other an Olym­pian in training from Edinboro, overtook the weary McGee.“I should have won,” said McGee of his third-place finish with a time of 59:58. “Breaking away three times during the race was probably a mistake. But it was fun.”

CMU loses opening game
By PAUL PLATOSH
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon women’s Lacrosse Team played their first game of the season last Satur­day with a concerted effort against the University of Pitts­burgh.Although the Tartans lost 7- 8, the team felt that it played a solid game. “I was impressed by the way we played. This was our first game, and I’m very proud of everyone, considering that Pitt is a very good team,” said fresh­man forward Lillian Elias.The Tartans fared poorly in
the first half, not generating enough defensive pressure, and suffering from a general lack of communication. Because of this, Pitt was able to carry a two-goal lead into halffcime.One redeeming factor was the gutsy play of freshman scoring sensation Elias, who kept the Tartans in the game with her crafty moves andblisteringback- hand shot.Senior captain Inge Swenson remarked, “We were shaky in the first half but we came alive in the second.” And come alive they did, completely shutting down Pitt’s offensive pressure
for long periods of time.The Tartans took advantage of their opponent’s disorganiza­tion by quickly chalking up three unanswered goals to take the lead.However, near the end of the game, the superior Pitt passing converted into a one goal lead for the Panthers, who managed to hold on to the lead despite tremendous offensive pressure generated by the Tartans.“We have a great future,” said sophomore Emanuelle Lafer. The Carnegie Mellon women’s lacrosse team meets Pitt again next Friday at Pitt.

PERSPECTIVE
Be the one to tell. 
Become a counselor for the 
Freshman Orientation from the 
Asian Perspective.
Asian Perspective is a supplementary 
component in the overall Freshman 
Orientation. It is not a rush event for all 
Asian organizations, nor is it an Asian 
socializing party. It IS a series of programs 
designed by student counselors to help 
Freshmen who have a background with 
Asian families or communities. It is NOT 
about telling Freshmen how to act or what to 
do as an Asian. It IS a forum for them to 
familiarize them with the diversity of Asian 
students on campus and the issues they will 
face. Issues can range anywhere from racial 
discrimination to the dating scene on 
campus.
For anyone interested in Asian Perspective, 
more information and applications to become

as 15-time All-American
Senior Brian Zimmerman ended his collegiate swimming career the weekend of March 20-22 at the NCAA Division III championships at the University of Buffalo. He earned five All-America citations at the meet.Zimmerman’s most recent All-America honors were a result of a third-place finish in the 200- yard individual freestyle (1:41.49), a seventh- place finish in the 500-yard freestyle (4:39.30), a seventh-place finish in the 800-yard freestyle relay (6:56.90), an eighth-place finish in the 400- yard freestyle relay (3:08.05), and a 14th-place finish in the 200-yard freestyle relay (1:25.88). The Tartans’ times in the 400- and 200-yard relays were school records. Zimmerman’s perfor­mance led CMU to a school-best 12th-place finish in the national standings.Last year, Zimmerman’s career was highlighted when he was named NCAA Division III Swimmer of the Year, and became Carnegie Mellon’s first national champion by winning NCAA Division III titles in the 200- and 500-yard freestyles.Zimmerman is a three-time UAA Most Valu­able Performer, has won 11 individual UAA titles, and has been a member of three relay teams that won league crowns.

Organizations construct this year’s legends
By TRUPTI PATEL
Tartan Staffuiriter
Bad weather and bad timing are the two pri­mary factors that are causing problems for the construction of booth this year. Many organiza­tions are finding it difficult to build in the rainy, and often snowy, weather conditions that have persisted throughout February and March.In addition, Carnival is one week earlier this year than it has been in the past; thus, booth chairs are finding themselves hard pressed to squeeze in an extra week of building before Carni­val. Despite the problems that have plagued booth this year, organizations are enthusiastic as well as optimistic about the upcoming Carnival.Phi Kappa Theta booth chair Craig Robinson says, “I think our building process is actually going really well. But it’s a last-second kind of thing because we’ve got a lot of detailing to do. If we get our booth done completely, we’ll be really strong.”Phi Kap’s plans for booth this year include build­ing a 25-foot tall structure and using about 2200 square feet of foam in order to construct the ‘Tower of Babel.” Robinson believes that Phi Kap will, as in the past, make a strong showing in the booth competition this year.Pioneers booth chair Paul Welding says that they also plan to make a tremendous effort to do as well in booth this year as they have done in the past. Pioneers, which is building a booth around the theme of “The Legend of Old St. Nick,” intends to integrate the Santa Claus theme into its game this year by having people build toys in order to win prizes.Welding says, “Our booth is pretty huge; it’s about 16 feet high. And the game is really cool because there’s a complicated pulley system we’re using.” According to Welding, the booth is not as colorful as last year’s “Dr. Seuss” booth, but it’s much more integrated and much larger.As far as other independent organizations are concerned, Welding says, “I heard FRINGE’S de­signs were incredible. I haven’t seen or heard much from SDC, which kind of worries me.”FRINGE assistant booth chair Randy Walter says the organization’s goal is to place in the top three of the independent division, but that they
are not speculating about anything else. This year, FRINGE is using the theme “Aladdin and the Magic Lamp.”Walter says, “We are usinga versionofAladdin’s Palace as our model, and we’ll be using a lot of Middle Eastern type of architecture to do it.” Although Walter says that FRINGE has been busy building since February, it has been hurt by the weather just like everyone else.“The weather is killing everybody. We just have to pray for good weather in the next week,” he says.Chris O’Keefe, who is Delta Tau Delta’s booth chair this year, says it has fallen behind schedule in its building. “We only started building re­cently, and it’s been going kind of slow. I don’t think we can get as much done as we originally expected to complete. We reduced what we origi­nally aimed at.”DTD’s booth theme is “Lord of the Rings” from J.R.R. Tolkien’s popular fantasy tale. It plans to build the Lonely Mountain, which is the home of the character Smog the Dragon.O’Keefe says, “I think we should have some­thing that looks really cool. There will be some­thing there that everyone likes. We don’t expect to win—we’re just out there having fun. My goal is just to have something that looks nice.” Kappa Alpha Theta’s theme this year is “ThetaWood Forest,” a variation of the legend of Robin Hood. Kelly Walter, a Theta booth co-chair, says that the outside of the booth will be an old English cottage, while the inside of the booth will be the forest. Walter says that, compared to last year, “we’re a lot more organized this year. We’re using the Walt Disney model of Robin Hood... trying to appeal to the kid in all of us.” Diaim Deal, also a Theta booth co-chair, says that “our goal is really to have all of our chapter participate and have fun doing it.”Even though the weather has been bad, it appears that the Carnival booth competition among all the divisions will be just as heated as it has been in the past.People aren’t letting the weather or the early timing get them down. The CMU campus com­munity can still expect to see a stunning Midway on Thursday.Phi Kappa Theta works on their booth this week.

Bad weather was once again the curse of freerolls. Three weekends of rolls were cancelled in March because of snow or rain. Many buggy teams have not been able to get the amount of practice they would like, and most buggy chairs agree that 
this will make race day less pre­dictable than usual.Seventeen teams will be com­peting in Sweepstakes 1992. Beta Theta Pi will not be com­peting this year. ASA will be exhibiting their new experimen­tal feet-first buggy. The teams are presented in the order of their best men’s finishes in 1991. 
•Spirit 
Changes: According to Chad Darby, Spirit buggy chair, “We went back to basics.” 
Predictions: While Darby thinks Spirit will win, he sug­gests that everyone “just show up on race day and see what happens.” He feels that race day will be very “random” since free rolls did not go well this year. 
Buggies: Shaka Zulu (’92),
Vicious Flow (’90),Tachyon (’89),Quantum Leap (’87)
•Pi Kappa Alpha
Changes'. PiKA has a new buggy, Cyclone, this year.
Predictions'. “I think we’ll do pretty well. We have a lot of fast pledges,” says Pika buggy chair, Tom Ambrose. Ambrose predicts that they’ll have two or three buggies in the top 10. He sees their biggest competition com­ing from Spirit and Sigma Nu. He also says that free rolls have been difficult this year with the bad weather.
Buggies'. Cyclone (’92), Ren­
egade (’91), Desperado (’90), 
Predator (’88)
•SDC
Changes: SDC revamped theirCteam buggy,
Bonzai.Accord­ing to chair Joe Bailey they’ve made mi­nor im­prove­
ments to the buggies and major improvements to their push teams.
Predictions: Bailey predicts that the team will do well this year. “Since 1990, we’ve built a strong foundation and we seem to get better and better every year, and this year is no differ­ent.” He thinks that no team can be discounted, but feels that the winner will be either PiKA or Spirit. Bailey is worried about the number of accidents in free rolls this year.
Buggies: Escargot (’91), Ter­
rapin (’90), Bonzai (’86) 
•Sigma Alpha Epsilon
Changes: “We are requiring our drivers be sober during prac­tices and rolls,” says chair Erik Gropp
fine and we’re hoping to beat last year’s time,” says Gropp. He predicts that Kappa Sig A will win this year.
Buggies: Tachooie (’91), 
Quasimoto (’89)
•Delta Tau Delta 
Changes: This year DTD has a female co-chair for buggy, Jen­nifer Kerstein. Says co-chair Rick Romero, “She knows the driver stuff and handles that aspect.”
Predictions: Romero feels that Sigma Nu is their biggest com­petition, but is unsure of how well his team will do because “there haven’t been enough free rolls.” He predicts that PiKA will win on race day.
Buggies:
Perception (’90), Deception (’90)
• Sigma Nu 
Changes: According to chair Jim Wiley, Sigma Nu is better organized this year.
Predictions: “We’d like to fin­ish in the top three,” says Wiley. He sees PiKA and Spirit as their competition and predicts that one of them will win. Wiley com­plains of the bad weather dur­ing free rolls, but doesn’t think it will be a problem on race day.
Buggies: KosD419 (’92), Jama (’90), Jerboa (’86), Colugo (’84) 
•Pioneers 
Changes: Pioneers will be in­troducing a new buggy this year. 
Predictions: “Our A team is shooting for the top 10,” says buggy chair Pete Harlee. “We are al­
ways trying to do better thanj last year.” Harlee feels that they; will have a lot of competition; from groups like Theta Xi,; FRINGE, and Phi Kap, but feels | that the winner will be eitherJ PiKA or Spirit. Freerolls have; gone well when it was possible! to have them, according to; Harlee.
Buggies: Tsunami (’92), Tur-\ 
moil (’91), EDGE (’89)
•Theta Xi
Changes: Theta Xi has refined! their program, according to chair i Doug Jotzke.
Predictions: “Our womens; team should do well. The men’s; team should be competitive.; We’re looking for a trophy,” says J Jotzke. He thinks Spirit will win| because “they get the choice of| the track people.” Because of the j lack of good weather, Jotzkes! says, “The place to be on race! day is in the chute.”
Buggies: Kurgen (’91), NemA

Talking with some folks who make it happen...Carnival Chairs
ffl
Meg Veily, chair of Carnival
How did you get involved in Carnival?“When I was a sophomore, I was asked to be the assistant to the midway chair. Then I spent two years as the midway chair and then, this year, as a fifth year senior, I was elected chair.”
Whats your favorite part of Carnival?“As midway chair, you have to stay near the midway. This year, I’m looking forward to seeing shows and going on rides. The booths are always really impressive, too.”
Jennifer Gaspari, Entertainment chair 
What’s new in Carnival entertainment this year?“This year the big concert will be on Saturday rather than Sunday to give everyone all of Sunday to clean up without being distracted by other events. I also think this year is really student-oriented... For example, the only people who can sell arts and crafts are faculty, students, and staff. Also, I really encouraged students to perform, as well as the outside performers.“
1 Phil (Goose) Marino, Midway co-chair
What’s new on the Midway this year?“We have a new rule that mandates that booths that use projectiles use some sort of screen to keep the projectiles in the booths — they’ll be fined if they don’t comply.”
What’s your favorite part of Carnival?“I like to watch the people building their booths. It’s fun to see how a pile of wood turns into some of those creations.”
Mark Yeek, Power and Safety chair
What do you think will be the best aspect of Carnival this year? “The concert will be really cool this year. The booths are always good, too. And, of course, the WRCT truck.”
Why do you think people should get involved in Carnival?“It’s neat to have all of the different organizations on campus working together on the same thing. It’s a lot of fun. We get free jackets. We get to carry around radios, too.”
Stephanie Horwitz, Publicity co-chair
How did you get involved in Carnival?“I was working at Skibo Info Desk last year when I overheard Bonnie Gorman talking about the committee and said I was interested.” 
Why do you think people should get involved in Carnival? “[Carnival] gives you a lot of experience for organizing things. It’s a really nice team feeling, too—the camaraderie is great. It gives you a way to get involved different from booth or buggy.”
Meri Tyler, Recycling chair
How did you get involved in Carnival Recycling?“Since I’m a CivE/EPP double major and have studied waste manage­ment, I became the recycling chair when they created the position.” 
What’s new in recycling this year?“We’re making recycling more visible and making it more attractive to Carnival-goers. We’re giving an award to the booth that’s the most recyclable.”
Stephanie Chrisp, SDC Tent chair
What’s new in SDC Tent this year?“This year we aren’t going to have a dance because we’re having many more acts this year. We’ve also moved the tent closer to the sidewalk so people don’t have to walk on the grass to get to it.”
How did you get involved in Carnival?“I’m a full-petitioned member of SDC in my sixth semester. I helped with tent last year and moved up to chair this year.”
Lance Wyatt, Security chair
How did you get involved in Carnival?“ I knew someone who was on the committee last year and so I got the position of security assistant last year — now I’m security chair.” Why do you think people should get involved in Carnival?“It’s a good way to get away from the rigmarole of everyday CMUlife. It’s a scheduled chance to let you hair down. If you don’t take advantage of that, you’re missing out.”

Compubookie speaks again
Editor’s note: Compubookie’s 
contributions are an annual tra­
dition submitted anonymously.The biggest story in buggy this year, as often happens, is the weather. With six consecutive days of freerolls rained or snowed out, many organizations are left scrambling for raceday plans. With permits increasingly difficult to acquire, the number of rolls before raceday this year has reached an all-time low.Organizations who have missed any of the days of rolls have to worry about qualifying new drivers and new buggies. This should set the stage for a large amount of buggy carnage come April 10 and 11. The suc­cess of Buggy ’92 hinges upon getting two clear days, which this year has been no safe bet.The Spirit-PiKA competition continues as it did raceday ’91 when Spirit was able to regain its men’s title. The rain-soaked coarse provided much slower times on Day 2 as Spirit A rolled a 2:10.63, while PiKA A could only manage a 2:11.04. These compare to the Day 1 times of 2:07.22 and 2:08.94 for Spirit
and PiKA, respectively. The win puts Spirit back on top of the Buggy world, having won four of the last five Sweepstakes com­petitions. With the loss of guru/ chair Terence Yarde, Spirit will have to work much harder to keep the trophy.Spirit’s main adversaries will again be the pushers of Pi Kappa Alpha. The ’90 champions will have the best shot at dethroning Spirit, but Compubookie doesn’t see it happening this year. The 1992 prediction will have to be Spirit A first, PiKA A second, and a surprising SDC A third. SDC’s fourth place finish last year is another notch in its rise to prominence that should con­tinue this year.Surprises for the top 10 in­clude Pioneers reaching a little higher and making it to Day 2. Perennial power house Beta Theta Pi seems to have fallen on rough times and will have to rely on its pushers to even make the top 10.Sigma Nu’s efforts, valiant as usual, will probably not land them higher than 6th. That is if its Hill 5 pusher can avoid the
DQ.On the women’s side, PiKA’s A team suffered greatly from graduation losses, while the early Spring Carnival should allow Spirit’s women to prevent PiKA from winning three con­secutive women’s champion­ships. ThetaXi’s depth on push­ers propels it to second place.The buggy technology race continues to be a heated one. New buggies from Sigma Nu, CIA, KDR, PiKA, Fringe, DU, and even ASA should all be roll­ing faster than ever. ASA’s luge/ skateboard wins the “we’d even lose to Limo” award for the year. Hopefully, all of these buggies make it to raceday because Compubookie loves to watch the show.With raceday rapidly .ap­proaching, Sweepstakes should prove to be more interesting than ever. The Midway can wait — the races are the place to be. Grab your umbrella, scope out a viewing spot, and watch closely; You will see some great buggy action and maybe out of the cor­ner of your eye, even a glimpse of Compubookie.
Compubookie takes a look at Busevl992....
aGS — Its new buggy is probably the only one its chair doesn't fit into.
c)GN.f — Would have better luck entering a demolition derby.
SeS — Has anyone seen Compubookie's skateboard?
eda — It’s hard to keep calling these folks a fluke.
Vtgyllim —May just camp out in the top 10.
8u22u eo1 — "Mom, I drive a buggy called ‘rolling death trap'.”
8d) — Two less pushbars won’t do much good.
VG Ru/ — Legend ... more like a fairy tale.
Vt(u — If the drivers don’t take the shortcut through the conservatory.
dPd — Too much cake turns drivers into chairs
,lvu — The only thing flying raceday '91 was the bird — Undertaker appears to be dead and buried. 
eSf — Takoohi... gesundheit!
SPI — If only DTD and Spirit could push for them on raceday.
et1/u NA — It's too bad that pushers are needed to win the race.
eo1 PuA — Emergency ejector system will probably be needed on raceday.
PUlvu "G — Nadz would roll down the hill faster than one of its buggies.
VUt 8u2 — A picture is worth a thousand words.
e2titv — If Terence could still push instead of just helping out, Spirit would be a lot better off.

Talking with some folks who make it happen...CamivaC Chairs
Mike Schwartz, Special Events chair
What’s new in Special Events this year?“Basically, there are two things sponsored by Special Events this year: miniature golf and the Go For A Spin frisbee group. ”
How did you get involved in Carnival?“I started as an SDC representative, then went to programming chair, then to tent co-chair, then to tent chair last year. Now, as a graduate student, I’ve taken on Special Events.”
Brian Papa, Technical chair
What do you think will be the best aspect of Carnival this year?“The band will be good. It’s at a much better time and it’s a much better band. The entertainment is really well coordinated this year.”
Why do you think people should get involved in Carnival?“I don’t think I’d have a lot of fun if I were just attending Carnival. Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday construction is just as fun for me as Carnival itself.”
Alexis dePlanque, Sweepstakes chair
What’s your favorite part of Carnival?"Getting to sit on the lead truck. You’re gonna have your Spirit and your PiKA, but there’s gonna be a lot of surprises, too.”
Why do you think people should get involved in Carnival?“You get to see a whole lot of what goes on behind the scenes — like in buggy mechanics and how different groups ran buggy and stuff. What else would get people out of bed at three o’clo ck on a Saturday morning? I think it’s noble. It shows a lot of dedication.”

new lighter, faster buggy that it will be racing this year.
Predictions: According to chair Rick Baker, “We’ll be pretty good, probably pushing in the top 10.” iJaker predicts that PiKA and Spirit will dominate the top 5 positions. Baker feels that the bad weather has hurt a lot of teams and that there will prob­ably be more spin-outs than usual on race day.
Buggies: Conquest (’92), 
Eclipse (’91), Spectre (’84)
0 Alpha Tau Omega
Changes: None
Predictions: “We’re hoping for the top 10,” says chair Dorian LaPaglia. “There’s no reason why we can’t make it. The bad weather has made it close in qualifying for race day,” accord­ing to LaPaglia.
Buggies: Probation (’91), Rebel 
Yell (’86)
•Kappa Delta Rho
Changes: According to chair Rob Wright, KDR. has “made a little tweak here and a little tweak there.”
Predictions: Wright feels that his team’s chances depends on the push team, but, like many other organizations, thinks his own organization can make a top 10 finish. He calls the whole race a toss-up.
Buggies: Prometheus (’89). KDR is uncertain as to which other buggies they will be run­ning.
•FRINGE
Changes: FRINGE will be en­tering a new buggy in Sweep­
stakes 1992. Also, according to chair Debra Perry, “We have a lot of new members and an en­thusiastic team.”
Predictions: Perry expects their team to be better than last year, but says, “It’s hard to call because of the weather.” She feels that PiKA will win, but considers Spirit to be very com­petitive as well.
Buggies: Atthis time, FRINGE is unsure of which buggies they will be running.
•Delta Upsilon 
Changes: DU has made orga­nizational changes and has a new buggy this year.
Predictions: “We’ll do much better than last year or than we’ve traditionally done. We had mechanical problems last year and we are confident that we won’t have them this year,” says Allan Tear, chair. He feels that their biggest competition is from Theta Xi, DTD, and SAE. He thinks that Spirit will win over­all.
Buggies: Merganser (’92),Teal 
Whistler (’91), Gargeny (’90) 
•Kappa Sigma 
Changes: Kappa Sighas added a women’s team this year. Ac­cording to chair Kirk Lenga, “Our main goal is to have fun, but we’ve tried to put a more competitive edge on it this year and put more effort into buggy.” 
Predictions: Lenga hopes that their team will finish in the top 25. He says, “We keep having bizarre mishaps everytime, but this year we think we’ll look okay.” He thinks that the race is

Buggies: Secretariat (’90), Cen­
tennial (’89)
By MARNI BLAKE
Tartan Staffwriter
The School of Urban and Pub­lic Affairs (SUPA) will present a symposium on today and tomor­row to honor the late Senator H. John Heinz III. The theme of the symposium is “Continuing the Vision.” The event will focus on “issues that were close to John Heinz’s heart,” explains Angela Burrows, SUPA’s director of public relations.“For this symposium, we have chosen two of the many issues we shared with the Senator: environment and international trade policy,” said Dean of SUPA Alfred Blumstein.Since SUPA’s beginning, Heinz was an advisor to the school, and he was a member of the SUPABoard ofVisitors when the board began in 1984.“Heinz’s death was a shock,” says Blumstein. “Rather than a passive memorial, we wanted a living memorial to the work of John Heinz.” SUPA sought the help of the Heinz family to find speakers who would offer com­peting academic perspectives on the symposium’s issues.Senator A1 Gore (D-Tenn) and
Teresa Heinz, wife of the late senator, will open the sympo­sium, which will begin at 7:45 pm this evening at Carnegie Music Hall. Gore will speak on “Continuing the Vision of John Heinz,” and Heinz will speak on the “Window on the Future.” Harris Wofford, Sophie Masloff, and Fred Rogers are also ex­pected to attend.The schedule for tomorrow will include panels focusing on the environment and international trade policy. Robert Stavins of the Kennedy School of Harvard University will be the keynote speaker for the first panel, “Stimulating Environmental Responsibility Through Eco­nomic Incentives: The Next Steps.” Stavins worked on Project 88 with Heinz, develop­ing ways to use economic incen­tives to preserve the environ­ment.Participants in this panel will include Lester Lave of Carnegie Mellon; Daniel Dudek, senior economist with the Environmen­tal Defense Fund; Robert Hahn of the American Enterprise In­stitute and adjunct professor of economics, Carnegie Mellon University; Philip Masciantonio,
vice president for environmen­tal affairs, USX Corporation’s U.S. Steel Group; and Edward Rubin, director of Carnegie Mellon’s Environmental Insti­tute.The panel will run from 8:45 to 10:45 am in the lecture hall of The Carnegie.Robert Reich, also of Harvard’s Kennedy School, will be the key­note speaker for the second panel, “American Competitive­ness, Industrial Policy, and the End of the World.”Other participants in this panel include William A. Reinsch, who served on the staff of Senator Heinz and is currently a legislative assistant to U.S. Senator John D. Rockefeller (D- W Va), Richard Simmons, chair­man of the board of Allegheny Ludlum Corporations, and Car­negie Mellon faculty members Bennett Harrison, Richard Florida, and Allan Meltzer.This second panel will run from 11 am to 1 pm in The Carnegie’s lecture hall.Anyone may attend the sym­posium. Reservations are re­quired and may be made by call­ing 268-2162.

L4The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 6 April 1992
How do CMU men measure up?
Here at Carnegie Mellon, we are often told that we are the 
creme de la creme. We represent "Hi1ie best and brightest of the people our age. Countless times, fchave heard a visiting guest to a group function or ceremony speak of the great things that you and I will do. In short, the speaker will say, \ve represent the future leaders and inven­tors of tomorrow.Of course such thoughts usu­ally send others screaming madly into the night as they realize with blatant clarity just who we are and of what we are capable. But none of this junk means anything in the day-to- day experiences we all have. In short, those of us who were fed the lie that we are the best, feel ourselves just struggling to keep up with everyone else here at CMU.But for you men out there, I’ve got something to show you. Tired of feeling average? Fed up with being normal? Well then, every­day average Joe, let’s see how you compare to the “normal” man. Men’s Health did some re­search by surveying men and observing some things we take for granted and came up with the following profile of the aver­age American man.The average man is married and 1.8 years older than his spouse. Considering the male/ female ratios at this school, we are far from average.The average man has not com­pleted college ... gulp! What is the attrition rate here again?$28,605 is the salary of the average Joe. Since CMU gradu­ates typically earn around
THE WIZARD OF R.A.
by Christian Restifo
$30,000, we men of CMU are really better than the rest on this one. Of course dramats and fine arts majors, whose work doesn’t become valuable until after they die, are excluded from this mean salary.How often do you cry? The typical male cries once a month, compared to four times for women. I guess some of us are just “manly men.”Has anybody out there been in love? Of course we all have. The average man falls in love six times during his life. Going by this standard, I’m half way there right now. If we use the mean­ing of lust instead, the average CMU guy falls in “love” six times a week.I personally take comfort in knowing that I’m average be­cause I can’t whistle by putting my fingers in my mouth. Some­thing tells me, however, that members of the Juggling Club could do it.Hey, Joe, the next time you’re in the bathroom, take a look at the toilet paper. The typical guy prefers that the paper roll out over the tube rather than under it. I don’t know why, but I’m really anal about this one. I will take the time to reorient the roll
to this position even if I’m in a public bathroom. At least I can take comfort in knowing that I’m making life better for some­one else.Feeling kind of aroused? The stereotypical male has sex 2.55 times a week. Don’t ask me what the other .55 times represents. I think it’s either when the man or his partner falls asleep, or it’s the thing responsible for the .4 in the average 2.4 children that families have. Concerning Joe CMU, however, we merely have to go back to the ratios here for a general idea of how he stacks up.Well, think you can guess what the everyday Steve daydreams about? Yep, sex. Then again, what else is there to dream about....Sorry, I was daydreaming. Where was I? Oh, here’s one for all those people looking for “Mr. Right.” Do you believe modesty is a good trait? The average man thinks so, and this is apparent in the fact that most think they look just fine when they are na­ked. Then again, the average guy is not a Netreker.Now, on this next point, I will admit that I don’t stand out from the crowd. The typical male will not stop to ask for directions when lost. I once read some­where that men have a better sense of direction than women, but I doubt they have better com­mon sense. Spend two hours in a car with a guy saying, “Wait, this area looks familiar to me,” as you proceed into the lower part of Mozambique and you’ll know what I mean.

ing men who they would prefer to be if given the choice. More men would rather be Kevin Costner than General Colin Powell. All I can say is that Powell didn’t have a “stand-in butt” take his place for the brief­ings during the Persian Gulf War. Given the option of being either Prince Charles or Prince, most men decided on real roy­alty. Dressing like Prince, rather than being married to Princess Di, is to me the lesser of two horrendous evils. Don’t his cheeks ever get cold with those freaky pants?Feminists should note that the average man still has some pretty outdated views. The av­erage guy is still worried about
being macho, and he’s still sex­ist. 70 percent of men would rather be Clint Eastwood than Woody Allen (27percent). Woody’s a wimp, anyway. Addi­tionally, when asked how rich they would be if they got a dollar for every sexist thought they had in the past year, men earned an average of $139.50.Something tells me that the average CMU guy could easily pay off his tuition bill if this were really the case. Maybe Fi­nancial Aid should start a new program.

CMU orchestra goes international
By AARON JENKINS
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editorwith help from their professors. The students received credit (9 units) for participating in the project, were paid for Saturday rehearsals, and received reim­bursement for wages lost be­cause of rehearsal time.For the concert, the 76-mem­ber Carnegie Mellon orchestra had to be increased in size to make the three orchestras (Mos­cow, Milan, and Carnegie Mel­lon) all the same size. Additional players — mostly string players —- were drawn from the ranks of recent graduates.The actual concert filming took place in Carnegie Music Hall on February 16. Upon the rever­beration of the last note, the audience gave the Carnegie Mellon students a standing ova­tion.“The full house didn’t merely applaud, but roared and cheered,” says Thomas.‘The Magnificent Six” has yet to be aired. RAI spent two years editing the performances, using the hundreds of hours of film shot, and has just recently fin­ished the process. The premiere show was presented in New York on March 13,1992 showing the orchestra performing Symphony No. 3 — which was the one piece not edited musically. There was a Pittsburgh screening three days later in Heinz Hall.“[The videotapes] are very well done, and the performances are beautiful. We were very proud of the level of performance of our students,” Thomas says with enthusiasm, “and everything we have heard indicates that they really were extraordinary.”
all the more difficult]. In addi­tion, any educational program requires a lot of implementa­tion, and we still ran our nor­mal education program, since [the RAI project] didn’t involve the singers and the producers and the conductors and so on. And to run the normal program, in addition to the [RAI project] was certainly an organizational
nightmare.”Rehearsal for the concert took place from January 29 to Febru­ary 16 in 1990. All of the rehears­als were recorded and filmed by RAI, who funded the entire project and brought two vans of technical equipment with them. The Alumni Concert Hall was used for the rehearsals, and the stage was manipulated in order
to accommodate the filming. The stage was later rebuilt.Students rehearsed for six hours a day, five days a week for the entire three week period and were excused from classes during that time. They kept up in their classwork by working with tutors, obtaining notes from classmates, working indepen­dently on course material, and
Jerry’s Girls e1•fBeE tHnfem•eEExhibit presents designers of future
By TINA URSO
Tartan Production ManagerAct II was a medley of songs from “La Cage Aux Folles”, where Jerry’s “girls” stepped aside to let the “men” strut their stuff. The costumes for these pieces were absolutely gaudy, fluffy and full of frills. The red spotlights made every­thing even more ridiculous. Al­though all of the “men” per­formed well in all the pieces, junior Larry Street’s perfor­mance of “I Am What I Am” was by far the most engaging, and made a suitable ending piece.The finale, which brought all of the cast on stage in their various costumes from earlier pieces and involved an excel­lent solo by Balach, brought warm applause and ended the musical in grand Broadway style.Overall, the cast seemed to be very pleased with both the turnout and the performances, and felt the show was definitely a positive experience for both the audience and themselves. Balach felt “the audience was really responsive and got a lot out of [the show].” According to cast members, everyone worked well together. No one performer saw him or herself above the others —- it was truly an ensemble cast,” said Quill. Everyone pulled their own weight and, as Gates felt, “did a good job.” But Quill was also quick to emphasize that a lot of credit was owed to Irwin, Thompson, and Jones, for the hard work they put into the show.The cast of Jerry’s Girls proved themselves to be di­versely talented, not only on an individual level, but at an ensemble level as well; and as Josephs said of the musical, and as it was echoed in the minds of the cast and anyone who was lucky enough to catch this outstanding performance, it truly was a “great experi­ence” that should not have been missed. Be there the next time this group performs.

from pencil-perfect hand ren­derings to “human factor” in­ventions. The designs were func­tional, ranging from a “hairdo helmet” which created hair styles such as the beehive or long tresses like Cher’s, to a glove which had a built-in toothbrush and toothpaste tube (now there is no reason for mom to tell you to take your fingers out of your mouth).Freshman Garland Lyn dis­played a logo for Eureka fash­ions. His elements of design, such as the five fashion models and the randomly placed text, worked symbiotically. Other works included sophomore Michele Sarko’s intermeshing structure of blocks and circle drawing.Sophomore John Ferris’ de­sign piece was equally interest­ing. Working in a small cubicle space he used different layers of color to create an aesthetically pleasing scene that resembled a sunset. Each layer of paper used was cut differently.The display has followed in the footsteps of the other shows that have been at the Hewlett Gallery this year; it leaves the audience with a very positive impression of the people in­volved. The works displayed cer­tainly foreshadow what can be expected of CMITs design stu­dents in the near future. And who knows.... One day you may pick up a product rendered by one of those in- Idividu-
While most of the rest of ¦ us were on the beach or home B catching up on sleep over H spring break, the CMU cast B and crew of Jerry’s Girls, a g 1986 Tony-nominated musi-1| cal revue of songwriter Jerry ¦ Herman’s work, were hard at V work preparing for their per- 1 formance which debuted this I past Thursday and ran I through Saturday at the I Alumni Concert Hall. Their performance — produced and directed by Christopher Josephs, choreographed by | 
Buddy Thompson, and musi­cally directed by Roseanna Lee Irwin — proved that their sac­rifice and hard work were well worth the effort.After dimming the lights for the beautiful solo and comple­mentary choreography of “It Only Takes A Moment,” sung by junior Amanda Raines, the show turned to a more comic tone, with senior Erin Quill singing an excellent rendition of “Wherever He Ain’t.” These two vocalists* later solos were also phenomenal and showed true professionalism.“Vaudeville Medley” was a particularly upbeat collection of tunes that helped showcase the diverse talents of the cast and, for the first time in the show, allowed the choreogra­phy and costume design to truly shine in full splendor. Espe­cially notable was the humor­ous duet of Quill and junior Margaret Gates, adorned in red flapper dresses. The out­standing interaction between Quill and Gates seemed truly genuine, allowing the audience to feel apart ofthe comic antics.“Hello Dolly” was a fitting piece for the first act of the i musical revue. The excellent H choreography, costume de- I sign, and ensemble per­formance of the cast on this piece came together to give a true Broadway
Absolut Vodka ads, Sony Walkmans, Coke cans, bicycles, and CD covers. Without design elements, these items would be non-existent. The future cre­ators of these type of items are the graphic and industrial de­sign majors at CMU. Last week, visitors at the Hewlett Gallery had the opportunity to sample some of the refreshing and inno­vative pieces students have pro­duced. In addition, other stu­dents could observe the interac­tion between a teacher, designer, and peers during class critiques. In other words, itVas an allow­ance for outsiders to acquire a general feel about the design class structure.The front foyer of the gallery was separated into two parts. On the right-hand-wall colorful visually-striking graphic design projects were exhibited. Some students experimented with CD covers for such musicians as Louis Armstrong and Cecil Tay­lor. Elements of jazz were incor­porated into the works of some by giving the impression of rapid movements of music lines. Oth­ers altered the typical calendar by blowing the stereotype out of context.In some instances, the num­ber of the days were strategi­cally placed within the text on the calendars. For example, one calendar piece moved away from the usual typographical place­ment of days of the month by squeez- 
n g the
mid days of the week between the 1 arger r epres entations of the first and last days.The other displays in the front foyer were dedicated to indus­trial design pieces. Junior Sean Pempel’s cellular phones moved away from the usual box-like formations. It seemed as if his streamlined models were spe­cifically designed to contour to the hand. The phone could eas­ily be cradled in one’s palm. Junior Youngmihn Kim had three “kid cameras” on display. The purpose of the design was to create a camera that was color­ful enough to attract a child’s attention and allow him or her to recognize the different parts of a camera.The main gallery held the larger part of the exhibit. It housed the works of freshman to senior design students. Dur­ing many of the gallery’s hours, students presented their ideas for projects and finished works. They proposed such thought- provoking creations as electronic sinks.Displayed on the ^wall of the main room were art pieces' vary- 
n g
musical feel. The comical addi­tions, like the audience sing­ing along and the introduction of male vocalists, juniors James Flick and Stephen Neely and senior Kevin Quigley, in Chip­pendale vests and bow ties helped pull the audience into the act.The next act carried much of the same energy, opening with a cast of women dressed in col­orfully contrasting and sexy- looking dresses, which really added to the playfulness of the act. Junior Theo Fried’s en­trance at the end as an aging, not-so-sexy stripper prima donna was hilarious and well- performed, showing that she too would be another one to definitely watch for the rest of the show.The performances in Act II were equally as enchanting and actually continued and surpassed the stage lighting effects found in the first act. There was a grand perfor­mance of “Mame,” which in­cluded a full cast supporting Fried as the intoxicated Mame.One of the most interesting lighting effects was found in the “Movies Medley”, which opened up with a very to-I
gether, beautifully balanced, and well harmonized chorus of juniors Nancy Balach, Gates, Valerie Komar, Suzanne Sacco, and Valerie Stadler. A very inter- esting strobe light ef- feet was used on the cast to simulate old picture movies, which ended up working really well.

Marvel’s Cage rises to power once again

atyd Ironfist to “bust heads for tl|e American dream.” Ah, but ypu better not call him Power- mjan anymore or he’s liable to grimace and yell “DON’T CALL M(E THAT” as chains explode abound his neck.; It’s easy to understand why tfyis man is so tortured with hate aijid resentment. “Framed for a cijime he didn’t commit” as a youngster, our pal Lucas Cage (v(rhose real name is shrouded in iriystery!) was sent to the Big House.

But thank God his name was cleared once again, and he has risen from the ashes. In his new title, he’s still a raging hero for hire when he’s approached by an upstart Chicago newspaper.The newspaper forms a part­nership with him. He gives them exclusive story rights to his ac­tion-packed misadventures and he gets paid a lot of dough, thus setting the premise for the book.The first storyline deals with some mob guy and his vicious diamond-studded bodyguard (whom Cage fights again and again). Yawn. Sometimes you just have to deal with the con­ventional.There are some highlights, however. The creative team on the book is very young and inex­perienced, which is a good thing. Dwayne Turner turns in very sharp, slick artwork.Though the writing is pain­fully trite, scribe Marc McLaurin
is young and has introduced a large supporting cast for our" bruisin’ hero. Indeed, if the book were to turn into a character study, it could be very interest­ing and novel. But Marvel’s got it’s priorities to maintain, after all, Cage is Marvel’s “HOTTEST action hero!” If you enjoy that kind of thing, this book is perfect... for you!

¡The spring slate of new net­work series is upon us. It started several weeks ago, with less- than-watchable entries like 
Scorch and Fish Police, and im­proved a bit with the over-hyped (and under-viewed) Young Indi­
ana Jones Chronicles.Lost in the endless promotions were the premieres of two ap­pealing comedies. One, ThePow- 
ers That Be, attempts to bring back political farce — with lim­ited success. The other, Room 
for Two, sticks to the tried-and- true, but still manages to enter­tain.Last summer, legendary pro­ducer Norman Lear flopped big- time with his super-slow Sun­
day Dinner. He seems to be get­ting back on track with The Pow- 
efe That Be though. Focusing on sl£>w-witted Senator William F. Powers and his mostly hateful family, this satire is always out­rageous and sometimes funny.¡Powers, portrayed by Dynasty a^um John Forsythe, is basically a ¡nice guy with high ideals who lets others run his political (and personal) life. The “woman be­hind the man” is nasty wife Margaret, played to the hilt by Holland Taylor. Alternately sdreaming, bawling, or silently conniving, Margaret always manages to get her way. The similarities of this couple to a certain pair of ex-White House dwellers is too obvious to even mention here.'.The two elder Powers seem relatively tame next to the sup­porting cast. Spoiled daughter
THE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
Caitlin is basically Stephanie Vanderkellen with no ego. Yes, it’s as frightening as it sounds. Her husband, Theodore, is a mis­erable shadow of a man who makes half-hearted suicide at­tempts at every opportunity.Bradley and Jordan, Powers’ assistants, are image junkies who always have portable phones at their sides. They hope to succeed by using Powers, in more ways than one — Jordan is having a not-too-secret affair with the Senator.In the premiere, New Yorker Sophie Lipkin shows up at the Powers’ house, claiming to be the Senator’s illegitimate daugh­ter. Possessing the tact and so­cial grace of a walrus, Sophie is shunned by everyone except the Senator, who appreciates how “real” and honest Sophie is. Her presence in the house provides yet another source of tension for family members.There are moments of inspired lunacy. Margaret’s sadistic treatment of meek maid Char­lotte is so ridiculous that it’s funny, and Theodore’s inane at­tempts to end his life offer up a couple of good guilt-ridden
laughs per show. In a recent episode, Theodore accidently shoots the Senator while fon­dling a gun. Everyone franti­cally tries to come up with a good story for the press, com­pletely ignoring the bleeding Senator on the couch.Unfortunately, such situations as the one shown above are far and few between; they are sur­rounded by spurts of uninspired dialogue and uncalled for over­acting.
The Powers That Be has all the ingredients for success, but so far it has failed. This is a show that doesn’t know what it wants to be. Combining the wide-open slapstick of Soap with the politi­cal humor of All in the Family seems an impossible, and not very desirable, task.Lear wants each of his shows to have a “lesson.” On his ‘70s sitcoms this worked. We laughed at Archie Bunker’s ignorance and learned something at the same time.But The Powers That Be is different. It is a farce. The com­edy is obvious, the situations are outlandish, and the charac­ters are nothing more than cari­catures. To succeed, this show needs to concentrate on the com­edy and leave its conscience be­hind.While The Powers That Be of­fers viewers something a little different, Room for Two doesn’t promise any surprises. This is another in a long line of stan­dard sitcoms with well-worn plots and almost identical char­
acters. Still, that doesn’t make it bad by far.Linda Lavin stars as widowed Edie Kurland, who in the opener visits her daughter, Jill, in New York City and ends up getting a job on the morning news show that Jill produces. It’s been a while since Alice, but Lavin hasn’t lost the independent flair that made that program so en­joyable.Edie is a woman who is finally
bit well. Needless to say, Jill is concerned that her mother will end up taking over her “new” 1 i fe in the big city. The tension be­tween the two is just as obvious as their love for each other. Edie claims she’ll find her own place, but the title (and the rules of Sitcomland) implies something else.The secret to any successful sitcom is a strong ensemble cast, and Room for Two boasts a zany
beginning to live for herself. She gets the job by criticizing (from the audience) a fashion designer for ignoring “what women really look like.” When the designer tries to give Edie a makeover, the horrendous results only prove her point: the clothes he designs are unfit for most women.As Jill, Patricia Heaton seems rather nondescript next to Lavin’s outspoken Edie, but she does the exasperated daughter
crew. Bonnie Bartlett (an old favorite from St. Elsewhere) stands out as the morning show’s dry-witted, no-nonsense execu­tive producer. The show’s an­chor is a swelled-head Ted Baxter type whose ignorance is sure to account for a number of one-liners.There is nothing spectacular about this show. Admittedly, it’s nothing new— we’ve seen simi­lar situations on programs like 
Coach, Major Dad, Evening
Shade, The Golden Girls, Empty 
Nest, and just about every en­semble sitcom since The Dick 
Van Dyke Show.But Room for Two doesn’t claim to be new or different. “Tra­ditional” doesn’t necessarily mean “bad.”What it boils down to is this: 
Room for Two is an entertaining program. The actors are good, the characters are likable, and the writing is top-notch. Who cares if we’ve seen it before? If- we laugh, then it’s done its job.I’d really like to like The Pow­
ers That Be. At its best, it could deliver laughs at the velocity bf' 
Soap and bring farce back to the forefront. Right now, though, it’s just something different— a strange mixture of ribald hu­mor, preachiness, and general confusion. For an offbeat show to succeed, it has to be pretty fantastic. Powers just isn’t there yet.
Room for Two, on the other hand, has already succeeded. It provides a solid (if predictable) half-hour, with stock characters, familiar situations — and funny lines.
Powers can’t deliver what it promises; Room promises little and delivers a lot. For now, I’d rather spend an evening with Edie and Jill: they’re less inven­tive, but a lot more entertain­ing.

More hole than bagel at Schwartz’s
EXPLORING PITTSBURGH
eoU&icte
By MARNIBOREK
Tartan Diversions Editor
Being from New York and all, I’m choosy about a lot of culi­nary treats here in Pittsburgh, namely pizza, Chinese food, and bagels—especially bagels. New York bagel shops are some of the mo^e interesting places to visit. They’re always small, crowded, and overheated. But no matter how poor of an atmosphere this may seem, customers are always assured hot bagels with a crust thick enough to enjoy, but not so thick as to prevent getting at the soft inside easily.Pittsburgh’s most recently opened bagel bakery in Oakland, Schwartz’s Bagels, takes a com­pletely different approach in serving up its bagels. Although the-eater/s idea of a sit-down bagel place might seem appeal­ing to those who have had a busy day shopping in Oakland or else­where nearby, the product isn’t worth the atmosphere. Maybe I’m .just spoiled, but I’m accus­tomed to more selection and larger bagels.Schwartz’s has the typical va­riety of bagels—plain, pumper­nickel, poppy seed, sesame seed, gayjic, etc. — but where are the egg, the Russian, the bran? When bagels are your main sell­ing, item you have to appeal to customers by offering a mid to large selection. Also, the bagels, made on the premises, are some- w^§t smaller than the ordinary
Dunkin Donut. I could get a pack­age of Lender’s Bagels from my supermarket’s freezer if I wanted bagels that could easily be plopped into a small cereal bowl. The bagel is supposed to get stuck on top of the bowl!Plain, the bagels aren’t very tasty, but I’ll give Schwartz’s credit for knowing how to put a little “meat” onto their bagels. Customers have choices of top­pings ranging from the conven­tional cream cheese to hummus. For those who want a little taste
butter which has more butter than bread is not worth the threat to your cholesterol level. I had to use the Meg Ryan tactic from the movie When Harry Met 
Sally and ask for the butter “on the side” in order to assuage my fears of clogging my arteries far­ther.This is not the place to order your usual type of bagel sand­wich. Your taste buds will not sing with excitement from them. If you are going to spend the money, get the hummus or the tuna.Perhaps after establishing themselves a little bit more,

Schwartz’s will concentrate a little more on making bagels and a little less on seeing how many tables can fit into their large bakery. If I’m in the mood for a bagel, I’ll go down there just to satisfy my needs, but otherwise, I’ll wait till I get back to good ‘ol New York.

It also happens that none of the good guys are women ... hmm. I don’t want to go into all the social implications of the movie, though, so I’ll just say a few words about the picture.
As whodunits go, Basic In­
stinct isn’t bad. The big prob­lem with it is that it doesn’t conclusively tell you who did it. The last scene is gratuitous, existing only to confuse the au­dience. The movie should really end earlier, when the person all the evidence points to is killed. The script could use some work, too. Lines like, “She’s evil! She’s brilliant!” just didn’t make it Even with its problems, this is one sexy movie. In the Broad­way musical City of Angels, one character says about a titillat­ing movie scene, “There won’t be a dry seat in the house!” — that’s what Basic Instinct is like.
STUMPED?
There’s lots of flirtation, seduc­tion, nudity, sex, and sado-mas­ochism. I have to admit, I en­joyed it.— Heidi Hoover
FRIED GREEN 
TOMATOES
. ????
The film Fried Green Toma­
toes is a simple but classy film, examining the friendship of two women, Idgy and Ruth (played by Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louse Parker), in post­war Whistle Stop, Alabama.The film celebrates the strength of women in an era when women weren’t known to be strong, and cherishes the strength women find from each other. From combatting a husband’s physical and mental abuse, to battling racism against the abominable Alabaman Ku Klux Klan, the movie’s protago­nists prove victorious against the most harrowing odds, and run their own restaurant all the while.Surrounding the inner tale is the story of another blossoming friendship — between Jessica Tandy, the aged Idgy, and the younger Kathy Bates, whose character is a frustrated woman strugglingwith questions of self- respect, and searching for an­swers to what seems a cold, topsy-turvy world.
Fried Green Tomatoes cap­tures the robust earthiness of the South and touchingly por­trays the lives of a few of its natives, with commendable per­formances by the film’s stars and director.

The drum line seemed erratic at times, but somehow still worked with other elements to make a rhythmic tune. The song en-, titled ‘There’s No Other Way” is an example of this style. It casts a mellow undertone with a different kind of dance beat.All in all, the music of Blur grows on you, in a fuzzy way. If not, you can always program repeat for “There’s No Other.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 6 April 1992L15
Thursday, April 9Repo Man
If you’re in the mood for an offbeat way to start 
carnival, this movie is for you.
Emilio Estevez plays a wild youngman who gets 
into the repossession business. Harry Dean Stanton 
plays Yoda to Estevez’s Luke Skywalker by teach­
ing him the ways of stealing cars from people who 
haven’t kept up their payments. For those of you 
out there who have had cars repossessed, bank 
accounts frozen, or collections agency problems, 
this movie gives you a humorous look at a no- 
laughing-matter situation.
This movie isn’t for everyone, but it is unusual 
entertainment for a buck.
At 7, 9.
Friday, April 10Warner Brothers Cartoons
The perfect movie to appease the hidden child in 
you, and we know that Carnival brings out the 
child in all of us.
Relive those Saturday mornings when you would 
get up before anyone else in the house just to watch 
cartoons. This time, however, you don’t even have 
to get up early (but you can wear your pajamas, if 
you really want to). What more could you ask for?
Spending one dollar to become a kid again — 
even poor college students like us can afford that.
At 7, 9.
Sunday, April 12Trading Places
Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy interchange­
able — preposterous, right? Well, this movie may 
make a believer out of you yet.
Eddie Murphy plays a professional money scam­
mer. He places himself in a box on a street claim­
ing to be not only an amputee victim, but blind as 
well. When Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy cross 
paths with him, they bet each other that Murphy 
could never survive in a wealthy environment. As 
a consequence of this bet, their fellow broker, 
played by Dan Akroyd, is put out on the street — 
penniless. Aahh ... the games of the rich and 
privileged.
Aykroyd’s uptight Philadelphia broker brings 
on the laughter when he trades places with 
Murphy’s dynamic street hustler. Ameche and 
Bellamy are perfect as the snobby know-it-all 
brokers who’ve never had a taste of their own 
medicine, and Jamie Lee Curtis is hilarious as a 
prostitute.
Who knows ... spending a dollar on this movie 
might even make that Carnival hangover a little 
more bearable.

While all of this was occur­ring, they also created their Dial- A-Song service, which is still in operation today. A regular call to (718)963-6962 in Brooklyn will offer you a new song spe- ; cially recorded for their phone line every day or two. Linnell described a problem with the phone line in the recent press release: “A lot of sounds just can’t be heard over the phone, and of course if you hit that sustained note which sounds like a beep, the machine ends the song right there.”Now, you’re wondering what to expect at the concert Satur­day at 4 pm on the Cut. Accord­ing to Flansburgh’s statement in the release:“Most rock shows are very schematic — they’re about big­ness. By comparison, our show probably seems very stripped ! down. We wear our street clothes on stage, and we talk to the ! audience. We play a few differ­ent instruments to keep things moving along, but we try to keep ! it simple. We’d rather the people notice the words than the laser show.” I know I’m looking for- 1 ward to this concert. Oh, and I don’t forget “eveiybody wants prosthetic foreheads on their real ! heads.”

They Might Be Giants to tower over audience at CarnivaB
This Spring Carnival, Scotch ‘N’ Soda presents Jack!—a tale of mystery about death at the hands of a serial killer who preys on prostitutes. This presenta­tion has a modern day Jack the Ripper plot which is just as in­teresting as the real life myste­rious killings that took place over a century ago in Great Britain.The show is a jazz musical written by alumnus Jim Lane and directed by first-year direct- ingmajor Kristieanne Reed. The story plays on the strange mix­ture of fear and fascination people experience when they face horror.At the onset of the play, audi­ences will discover that two women have become the next victims of a serial killing. The people of the Red Light District are in a panic about the stalker who wanders the streets in search of a victim. Philip McNeil, portrayed by junior CS major Michael Walker, is a sharp, ruth­less journalist for the Daily Re­
porter, who coins the nickname of this homicidal serial killer, “Jack.” The public is fascinated by the circumstances and is eat­ing up the publicity. The police, led by homicide detective Joanna Brogan, played by sophomore H&SS student Beth Chambers, and police chief, Dan Harris, portrayed by sophomore ECE major Jared Oberhaus, desper­ately search for a suspect. The detective and the police chief are left with no clues as to who this night stalker is.By the end of the musical, the body count has nearly tripled and the lives of the characters are irreversibly altered. On an intellectual echelon, Jack! makes a statement on power and its use as a mechanism of good or evil.The writer, alumnus Jim Lane, was inspired to write this play mainly to make a state­ment about how the media con­stantly portrays a partial depic­tion of news events. He wanted

Who (or what) are They Might Be Giants (TMBG)? We know they are the big band perform­ing during Carnival this year, but what else? Well, “they might be rain, they might be heat, they might be frying up a stalk of wheat, they might be brain, they might be washed, they might be Dr. Spock’s back-up band,” (from the song “They Might Be Gi­ants” from the album Flood). They might be John Flansburgh and John Linnell (and they are). If that doesn’t clear it up for you, then maybe their new album 
Apollo 18 will help.This exciting new album pro­duced solely by the band fea­tures some extreme song ar­rangements, from “Dig My Grave,” with the vocals recorded through a guitar fuzz box, to “The Guitar (The Lion Sleeps Tonight),” an alternative cover of a song by the same name from the ’60s. On the track, “I Palin­drome I,” they have created pal­indromes as the lyrics, but the palindromes are composed of individual words (rather than the letters) which are symmet­ric. An entire verse reads the same forward and backwards (as does the title.) The space theme is carried along by the track “See The Constellation,” “a song about a guy made of dots and lines,” and “Space Suit,” an instrumental piece which closes this incredible album on a more serious note.TMBG have agreed with NASA to be the Musical Spokes- people for International Space Year (ISY). This year has been dedicated by Congress to the celebration of space as an inter­national frontier. TMBG have dedicated their tour to ISY and will be promoting its message of

peaceful discovery throughout their concerts.Before the release of Apollo 
18, a CD with four songs was released entitled The Statue Got 
Me High. These included “Which Describes How You’re Feeling,” a different version than is found on Apollo 18, and an otherwise unreleased track “I’m Def” from their 1985 demo-tap e. Apollo 18 is one of the first CDs to take full advantage of the random fea­ture found on most CD players today. The song “Fingertips” is divided among twenty-one tracks, and each track is a dif­ferent refrain from two to seven seconds long. When the CD player randomizes the playing order, the listener is provided with “an ever-changing musical collage.”In a recent press release sent out by the band’s record com­pany, Flansburgh summed up the band’s style.

“Essentially we’re a cultural U.F.O. We don’t fit into a trend, and the people who like us like us for a wide variety of reasons. We’re definitely pro-melody... We want to take melody back from the forces of evil.”Looking back to the ’70s, you would find Linnell and Flans­burgh as high school friends working on the school paper and recording some songs together. After graduation, they moved to different states playing in a few hobby bands, but in 1981 they both returned to Brooklyn and moved into an apartment to­gether. They began making re­cordings in their apartment with whatever equipment they could find. By the mid-eighties, the Lower East Side club scene was heating up again, and they be­gan playing with avant-garde musicians and other types of artists who influenced their

to play on this bias of the media. Lane has had much experience as an actor, but has discovered that his talent lies more behind the scenes as a playwright. Lane is suave, outspoken, and per­sonable. He comes from a theat­rically inclined background — his sister is an actress and many of his close friends are from the theater. Especially impressive is that Lane wrote the music for the production, as well as the lines. For Lane, the production is a great learning experience. “One must follow his dreams to truly be happy,” he says. That is what Lane has done. He has followed his dream and is begin­ning to see the results.Director Kristianne Reed is an organized, motivated, and energetic person who brings a passion to the stage. She has an encompassing smile and happi­ness that makes her an easy person to talk to. Reed brings a brutal reality to the musical.
She does not hide the thought provoking message of power and its use. Reed brings to the pro­duction an acting experience mainly in musical theater. When she first auditioned to direct this production, she brought with her some reservations as being the only woman to audition. How­ever, she proved herself to be competent and talented when she was granted the position.Freshman directing major Kelleigh Greenberg has stepped into her dancing shoes as chore­ographer of this production. Be­fore I interviewed her, she was busy perfecting a jazz step. Her choreography is smooth, precise, and energetic. Her professional­ism, like Reed’s, is reflected in her energy and attention to de­tail.Greenberg has been stepping, strutting, and tapping her way into her audiences’ hearts for the past eight years. We might just see her choreographing
other productions in the future ’ because she has done a hell of a job here. Greenberg enjoys the stage and will be someone to watch for in the future.The cast of 25 actors, a pit orchestra, and an even larger production staff are sure to please. After all, last years’ 
d’Artegan:a requiem was a great success. Jack!is Scotch‘N’ Soda’s largest undertaking in many years. One of the things that has given this show so much poten- ; tial is the way the cast has got- ; ten to know each other over the ; past three months.“Everyone knows each other now. Everyone’s got their back- ; stage jokes. It’s a friendly atmo- : sphere,” says Chambers, one of the show’s leads.So come one and all to this murderous tale of death and ' deception premiering in the ball- room Thursday, April 9, and clos- • ing Sunday, April 12. Don’t miss ' this opportunity.
