The combined musical clubs will hold theii' annual 
concert at Carnegie Music Hall on the evening of 
March 28th. After the concert a dance is to be held 
in the Conservatory of Music, on Dithridge street, at 
which the stubs of the $1.50 and $1.00 seats will be 
honored. It is the hope of the management that 
every student will make an effort to be present on 
this occasion. The clubs give but this one home
concert in the year and it is the only time that the 
individual student is called upon to support the or­
ganization. Therefore, see to it that this support is 
given as it should be.
The program arranged for this year, printed in full 
on page 8 of this issue, contains many novel fea­
tures that should make it very attractive and inter­
esting to the audience. For the first time we will

have Scottish songs sung by a quartette dressed in 
Highland costume. The Mutt and Jeff feature, as 
sung and performed by G. C. Smith and John Ban­
bury, will be enjoyed by all of those who are watch­
ing their heroes with the Insurrectos in Mexico. The 
campus scene in the second part of the program is 
the creation of Manager Button and it furnishes'an 
opportunity for some very effective work on the part 
of the clubs.
The Mandolin Club has its share of the program 
in excellent shape. They will play for the first time
in Pittsburgh the new waltz written and dedicated 
to the club by their director, Sgn. Schalzo. It is called 
the “Tech Waltz” and is pronounced very fine by 
those who have heard it played.
The dance feature which is introduced for the first 
time this year and which the management hopes to 
make an annual affair, has caused much favorable 
comment upon the part of the students. It is indeed 
fortunate that such a good floor is to be had so near 
the Music Hall and the small trouble of going from 
one place to the other is no objection. In order that

no mistakes will occur we again repeat the arrange­
ments made. All those who hold the seat stubs of 
$1.50 and $1.00 tickets will be admitted, this applying 
to couples only. No other ticket is necessary. The 
dancing will commence upon the closing of the con­
cert, reasonable time being allow for the passing
BOARD OF CONTROL
A special meeting of the Board of Control was 
called for Wednesday evening, March 15, but the 
blizzard was too much for the majority of the mem­
bers and no business was transacted. The excuse 
for that one meeting was plausible, but a few of the 
members have been absent more than two successive 
meetings. This is not fair to the classes which they 
are elected to represent, and such classes owe it to
from one place to the other, and will continue until 
one o’clock. As the popularity of this feature this year 
will probably determine whether or not it is retained 
in the programes of years to come, the management 
desires that all those interested will take advantage 
of the opportunity offered.
themselves to see that their representatives attend 
all meetings in person, or send proxies. The business 
transacted or brought before each meeting is of the 
utmost importance to the school as a whole, and to 
each student in the school. If your class is not rep­
resented, you lose a vote in these matters, and the 
loss is individual. The Tartan suggests, as it has be­
fore, that each and every member of the class make 
it a point to see that his class is legally represented 
by the man elected for that purpose, or by another 
elected to fill his place.

THE TARTAN
HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE MUSICAL CLUBS
Some short six years ago a handful of the students 
of the charter classes meet at a smoker and out of 
that meeting grew the musical clubs as we know them 
today. This growth was not the result of accident but 
of hard work and consstent policy on the part of the 
managements and faithful work upon the part of the

clubs’ members. We have every reason to be proud 
of the results, for we have in this years’ club an 
organization which will take rank with any similar 
organization in this section.
L. H. BUTTON, Manager
1910-1911
The first year little more was done than to give 
the home concert at the Hall. The second year saw 
an improvement in the work of both club and an in­
crease in size but as the management wisely de­
cided that the time was not ripe for the taking of
out of town trips no concerts were given outside of 
the one at Carnegie Hall.
The *third year saw the same policy used, that of 
improving and strengthening the clubs before at­
tempting ambitious trips. However, several concerts 
were given about the city and in the various suburb­
an towns. During the fourth year the strength of 
the organiation warranted the enlarging of the plan of 
visiting suburban places and the result of the in­
creased number of concerts was visible when it came 
time for the home concert.
The fifth year saw the management making ar­
rangements for a Christmas trip and the scheduling 
of several of one of two concert trips of greater dis­
tance that heretofore undertaken and so we arrive 
at the sixth year of the existance of the musical clubs 
and the results of the hard work of previous years 
will be seen at the concert in Carnegie Hall next 
Tuesday evening.

A word of praise is here due to the hard working 
directors of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs. Upon their 
shoulders rests the responsibility of shaping and fin­
ishing the clubs so that the performances may be a 
credit artistically.
THE DIRECTORS OF THE MUSICAL CLUBSMr. R. J. McDowall, Director of the Glee Club, has 
had much experience in leading and training clubs 
of this nature. He was tenor soloist on the Prnceton 
Glee Club the four years that he was in college and 
also acted as leader during his last year. After grad­
uation he became a member of the famous Moody 
Quartette in Chicago. Later he elad the W. & .1
SGN. GREGORIO SCALZO 
Director of Mandolin Clubs, 1910-1911
Glee Club. Mr. McDowall has a rare personality and 
the faculty of holding the continued interest of the 
members of the club.
In the securing of the services of Sgn. Gregorio 
Scalzo the Mandolin Club was very fortunate. Sgn. 
Scalzo is a mandolin player of international repute, 
having successfully led a mandolin club of over 400
players in Leipic. He has twice made tours of South 
America in the capacity of mandolin soloist. Upon 
his arrival in this country he took a postion with the 
Pittsburgh Orchestra, which positon he retained un­
til the disbandment of that organization last spring. 
He has written a “Tech Waltz” for the Mandolin 
Club’s use at the concert next Tuesday.
CRAFTSMEN CLUB
The smoker that was held on the evening of March 
17th in Room 104 was the most successful the club 
has ever had and one of the best given around Tech 
for some time. Dean Connelly, wearing both the 
green and yellow, caused much laughter in opening, 
when he explained the reason that the green always 
out-classes the yellow.
The main cards of the evening, from an entertain­
ment point of view, were Messrs Walker and Muller,
Mr. Walker performed by singing some songs, crack­
ing some jokes and drawing some pictures. Mr. Mul­
ler, a graduate, did several acts. He juggled in fine 
form, beginning with balls and ending with a gun 
large enough to scare the entire Mexican army grey 
headed. He was next tied into a chair by two mem­
bers of the club and worked himself loose in just 2 
minutes, 58 seconds. The moving pictures furnished 
by the Dean were much enjoyed.

Carnegie Technical Schools
Attention is called to the notice in another column 
of the invitation sent by the Harvard Aeronautical 
Society to the Aero Clubs to enter the meet to be 
held on the Harvard Aviation Grounds during May. 
We would all like to see Tech enter this meet. We 
would like to see the glider now in existence put in 
good condition and sent on, but that can not be done 
unless more interest is shown by the majority in the 
affairs of the society. And that brings us to a point 
we would like to make.
The Aero Club started off with great enthusiasm 
and much progress was made during the first year of 
its existence. When the work of carrying on the or: 
ganization fell upon the shoulders of a few, who are 
doing their best to maintain a general interest in the
affairs realting to the science of areonautics. It is 
the lack of continued interest and helpfulness upon 
the part of the members of the club that is so hurt­
ful and it argues ill for.the future of tre club unless 
it is remedied. Can’t those who are members of the 
Aero Club take this opportunity and get together, 
putting their society on firm ground again, building 
a new glider or remodeling the old one and entering 
this meet.
THE GLEE CLUB CONCERT
There is one very good way of measuring our 
growth as an institution and that is the comparison 
of our student activities from year to year. As surely 
as the size and strength of our student body ncreases, 
as surely as the spirit and love for our Alma Mater 
increases, so surely does the quality of the work 
perrormed by our various student activities increase. 
And, in the picking out of an organization to use as 
a criterion, we can hardly do better than select the 
Glee and Mandoln Clubs, they having started in the 
first year of our life as an institution.
There has been in the past the very just criticism 
that our student activities warranted a much better 
support than they have received from the hands of ¦the student body as a whole, and that the burden of 
carrying on and founding these activities rests on the 
shoulders of too few individuals. This is as true in 
the. case of the Glee Clubs as with any other organ- 
izaton that might be mentioned. This year the offi­
cers and members of the clubs have worked hard 
and faithfully and promise to put on the best con­
cert that we have ever had given. They surely de­
serve a much better support from the student body 
than they have ever received heretofore. See to it 
that they get there just dues. There is no excuse 
for any man, night or day, being absent from this 
concert except one and that is, he has not the spirit 
that goes to make a true Tech man.
ALLEN T. BURNS LECTURES TO APPLIED 
SCIENCE
Last Thursday, Mr. Allen T. Burns, secretary of 
the Civic Commission of this city, gave an illustrated 
lecture on the ways and means of improving the city 
of Pittsburgh.
Mr. Burns spoke on the sewage, rapid transit and 
water front problems. His talk wras very interesting 
and instructive throughout and was heartily enjoyed 
by all.
No trouble at all.—“Have you any serious trouble 
with your new automobile?”

out being able to get away before he got my number.”

Dear Mr. Editor: —
Back in the 16th century Roger Ascham wrote: 
“A past'me, saith Aristotle, must be like medicine. 
Medicincs stand by contraries; therefore, the nature 
of studying considered, the fittest pastime shall soon 
appear. In studying every part of the body is idle, 
which causeth gross and cold humors to gather to- 
gethther and vex scholars very much; the mind is 
altogether bent and set on work. A pastime then 
must be had where every part of the body must be 
labored, to separate and lessen such humors withal; 
the mind must be unbent, to gather and fetch again 
his quickness withal.”
These quaint words voice a valuable suggestion to 
the latter day student. Every man should have a 
hobby, a pastime, an interest apart from his daily 
work. I'cr the student of books in a city school, that 
pastime may best be some interest which calls him 
out of doors into the open. Nothing brushes the 
cobwebs from wearied brains so quickly or so thor­
oughly as bright sunlight, fresh breezes and open 
spaces. There things take on their true values. “At 
the gates of the forest, the surprised man of the 
world is forced to leave his city estimates of great 
and small, wise and foolish.” College sports are 
good but their interest is not lasting. Moreover, the 
athletics of today, it is to be feared, are somewhat 
too exacting to offer much opportunity for real relax­
ation. The pastimes I have in mind are not engaged 
in as contests or for exercise’s sake, but are under­
taken for love of the things themselves, exercise 
being simply an attendant circumstance. It may be 
hunting, fishing, boating, animal or bird study, bot­
any, forestry, geology or any one of the many phases 
of nature, but it should always be a study made not 
from the written page but from things themselves.
As Thoreau says in his introduction to his essay 
on walking—“I wish to speak a word for nature, for 
absolute freedom and wildness, as contrasted with 
a freedom and culture merely civil, to regard man 
as an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of nature, 
rather than a member of society.”
If one has no interest in a particular form of out­
door life, let him go into the fields and woods with 
eyes and ears open to the message of the rocks, the 
trees, the birds, the flowers. Let him leave behnd 
him thoughts of Calculus and Chemistry, of Econom­
ics and Electricity—to go in the body and not in the 
spirit, will not answer. In such a mood it is sur­
prising how many objects of interest will be found. 
If he tries to see beneath the surface, to discover the 
law determining what at first sight seems mere 
chance, he will have made the first step toward what 
may prove a lifelong diversion. John Burroughs says 
“We open another eye whenever we see beyond the 
first general features or outlines of things—when­
ever we grasp the special details and characteristic 
markings that this mask covers.” It is wonderful to
what degree the powers of observation bay be culti­
vated. I have climbed one particular mountain in 
central Pennsylvania with men who had opened 
this third eye. The woodsman saw curiosities in the 
trees and in the fungus growths. The bird lover had 
an eye for every bit of flitting color and an ear for 
every bird note. The geologist found a story in the 
tilting of the rocks, the outcropping of the different 
strata, the work of erosion, a story which went back 
thousands and thousands of years. All had been a 
closed book to me.
Wth the awakening of interest in outdoor life there 
is opened a new field of literature from which he will 
derive keen enjoyment. Thoreau’s Excursions, Gil­
bert White’s Natural History of Selborne, John Bur­
roughs Locusts and Wild Honey, Sir John Lub­
bock’s Beauties of Nature, Buckland’s Curiosities of 
Natural History, and many other essays upon life in 
the woods and fields are beautifully written books of 
a popular character which it will pay any one to read 
who is not already familiar with them. If more scien­
tific works are desired there is a wealth of material 
to draw upon.
We sometimes think that we need to go to great 
distances and devote much time in orded to know 
something of nature. To quote Thoreau again, “There 
is a sort of harmony between the capabilities of 
landscape within a circle of ten miles radius, or the 
limits of an afternoon’s walk, and the three score 
years and ten of human life. It will never become 
quite familiar to you.” Burroughs, indeed, said Thor­
eau was almost as local as a wood chuck. Lubbock, 
Burroughs, Gilbert White and scores of other writ­
ers on natural life were busy men in callings mak­
ing great demands on their time.
The beautiful hills and woods all about Pittsburgh 
offer many attractions to the lover of the open coun­
try. Get beyond the smoke belt and discover a new 
interest which will prove a sauce to the daily menu 
of books and study. John H. Leete
JUNIOR MECHANICALS VISIT WESTINGHOUSE 
ELECTRIC
Last Friday afternoon the Junior Mechanical Class 
visited the Westinghouse Electric and Mfg. Co’s 
plant at East Pittsburgh.
The Junior Mechanicals are at present time de­
signing a self-aligning high duty bearing, 9 inches 
in diameter and 24 inches long, and the object of the 
trip was to get some ideas with reference to same by 
inspecting the large electric generator bearings made 
by the Electric Co.
The various designs will probably be sent to the

AERO CLUB
Communications from the Harvard Aeronautical 
Society bear invitations to the Intercollegiate glider 
meet to be held May 3, 4, 5, and 6, on the Harvard 
Aviation Grounds, Atlantic, Mass. The meet will be 
divided into two classes; first, for gliders with me­
chanical and second, body control. The events are
1. Distance of glide.
2. Duration of glide.
3. Speed.
4. Accuracy in landing.
Hangars will be provided for machines and a glid­
ing slope is to be constructed. Cups for 1st and 2nd 
prize in each event will be offered and a special 
prize for totalization of distance covered by a glider 
during the meet (four days.) Prizes will be awarded 
on the basis of efficiency, i. e., with regard to total 
weight carried per square foot for given distances.
For the benefitof those who might care to enter 
it may be stated that a glider may be built at a cost 
of from $8 to $20 according to size and the time of 
construction (spare time) required is thre.e weeks 
to a month. If any person has the money and inclin­
ation to enter it will save him time to communicate 
with Wm. B. Chalfant of the School of Applied De­
sign, at present acting secretary of the Aero Club, 
as the Harvard Society wishes data of the machines 
entered. It is possible that the glider at present in 
the schools will be put in shape to compete. Certain­
ly it would be a fine thing for Carnegie Tech to find 
representation in a meet of this nature.
Attention is called to the Exposition Auto Show 
where seven full sized aeroplanes will be exhibited, 
affording an unusual opportunity to study at close 
range the method of operation of several prominent 
makes of aeroplanes.
BASEBALL PROGRESSING
On account of King Winter still remaining with us, 
outdoor baseball practice has been delayed until the 
field shall be in proper shape. The squad, which now 
numbers forty five, has been working in the Field 
House every Thursday afternoon and Saturday morn­
ing for the last three weeks and the men are begin­
ning to lose their stiffness and show speed.
The pitching staff has had little chance to show 
what they can do, but it will be the highest degree 
of hard luck if at least one Babe Adams does not 
appear out of the fifteen candidates.
The first game of the season will be with a team 
from the Alumni on the field on Saturday, April 8.
TESTS ON CONCRETE BEING CARRIED ON
The Consolidated Expanded Metal Co., of this city 
has recently built four reinforced cinder concrete 
slabs in the Materal Laboratory for testing the 
strength of their expanded metal in this class of con­
struction.
The arches which are of the flat type and of stand­
ard design are 4 inches thick, 6 feet square, and are 
carried by two 12 inch, 31.5 lb. I beams whose ends 
are suported by the concrete foundation walls. Each 
arch, is reinforced with a sheet of the company’s ex­
panded metal, 6 feet wide and 12 feet long, placed 
one inch above the bottom of the arch at its center, 
then caried over the tops of the 12 in I beams and 
bent around its upper flanges of 10 inch 25 lbs. I 
beams in order to secure an anchorage. Each of these 
10 inch I beams is supported throughout its length 
by the concrete foundation walls. Three different 
weights of expanded metal have been used for the 
reinforcement. The concrete is a 1:2%; 4% mixtue 
ofr Lehigh cement, river sand and anthracite cinders.
The arches will be tested at the age of eight weeks 
or about May 1st by subjecting them to a standard 
load of pig iron. Deflection will be measured for 
given increments in loads with a Y level reading 
on rods located upon the ends and middle of each 12 
inch I beam and upon the center of the arch.
These tests are to a certain extent of a prelimin­
ary nature for when they are completed similar slabs 
will be built at the Columbia University Fire Test­
ing Station in New York City and will be subjected 
to the standard fire, load, and w'ater tests required 
by the New York City Building Bureau.
JUNIOR CLASS MEETING
Last Thursday the Junior Class of Applied Science 
met and transacted certain business pertaining to the 
class and school.
Henderson of the Junior Prom Committee read the 
Junior Prom report.
The class historian, Mr. R. A. Porterfield, having
left school, Mr.. Erglebrecht was appointed in his
place.
As a culmination of the growing sentiment in the 
class in favor of establishing the “honor system” a 
committee was appointed to collect data bearing on 
the system with a view towards the class going on 
that basis in the senior year.
The committee is as follows:
F. R. Cogswell, Chairman.
E. R. Boots.
J. H. Knapp.
F. W. Marker.

It is to be hoped that the quartette which is to 
wear the kilts at the concert on the 28th has secured 
an accent that matches their costume.
Those who attended Dr. Holland’s lecture on “The 
Paleontological Researches of Carnegie Institute.” 
will at least know the proper pronunciation of the 
name of our friend with the long neck and longer 
tail.
Mr. Alfred Ormston is from Oil City.
Professor Trinks was the honor student of his 
class at Charlottenburg and shows his German de­
scent by an overwhelming fondness for Wurtzburger 
and German cooking.
Mr. Phouts, King of the Pattern Shop, hails from 
Youngstown, Ohio, and is a reliable authority upon 
labor conditions throughout the United States.
When a man says “I have failed,” it generally 
means that he has shown the white feather and has 
not got the nerve to fight it out.
Professor Follows makes standardizing his hcbby 
and fishing his avocation.
Professor Willet is fond of wearing neckties to 
match the suit he happens to have on.
Success is not achieved easily. It is difficult to be­
come even a successful loafer.
OBSERVATION ON POLARIS
On Monday evening, the Senior Civils made an 
observation on Polaris, at western elongation.
The altitude of Polaris was taken to get the meri­
dian of the schools.
Weather conditions were of the best, and all things 
considered the results of the observation should prove 
to be very accurate.
Two parties were in the field under the direction 
of Prof. Reed.
Correction will be computed and the true meridian 
staked out upon Observatory Hill.
MECHANICALS VISIT AUTO SHOW
Last Saturday afternoon the students of the Me- 
chancal department took in the Auto and Aero Show 
at the Exposition under the able and stalwart lead­
ership of Asst. Professor J. C. Sproull. The idea of 
making such a trip was a good one because from be­
ginning to end the trip was an inspiration through­
out.
Unquestionably the management of the show have 
done their work very well; the decorations, the meth­
od of laying out the various booths and marking of 
same with beautiful signs hung on posts, all tended to 
give a very pleasing effect.
The show was enjoyed by all the party especially 
by Mr. Alfred Ormston of the party. Mr. Ormston 
is from Oil City.

Carnegie Tech, all hail to thee!
We’ll sing thy praise most reverently,
For the powers gained through the hours spent neath 
guiding
Have revealed knowledge to shield through thy 
providing.
Thou art the head and the source of the uplifting 
force,
Giving the power that in truth is abiding,
And the shield will not yield in the mild fight.
For the facts like an ax will be hurled right.
To clear the way for truths’ pure might,
We will march with a spirit, a strong Carnegie 
spirit,
That is ready to die for right.
The above lines were written by Miss E. R. Stoner, 
of M. M. C. S., and have been set to music by her, 
making one of the most inspiring of school songs. 
Everyone should learn the words and music for both 
are an educating force for which we heartily thank 
Miss Stoner.
BIG MEET SATURDAY
The Indoor Inter-School Meet, scheduled for 10 
o’clock Saturday morning, promises to be a most in­
teresting event. Each of the three schools has made 
entries in every event and the rivalry that has been 
shown so far gives every indication of spirited con­
tests. The twenty-yard dash and the quarter-mile 
potato race have attracted the most enthusiasts, but 
the other events will have a full number of con test­
ants. A number of men have been practicing with the 
shot and at the jumps, and a few feel confident of 
establishing records for the Field House that future 
athletes will have trouble in beating.
Each school is allowed to enter four men in each 
event, all entries to be made before 6 P. M., Wednes­
day. This means that no delay should be experienced 
in running off the contests, and every man not en­
gaged in business on Saturday morning can and 
should come out and root for his school.
Revenged.—A real joke was sprung by a student 
at the Western Reserve University last week. This 
student suffers from the stigma of obesity; it appears 
that even professors do not love a fat man. After a 
particularly unsuccessful recitation in English III., 
the professor said:
“Alas, Mr. Blank! You are better fed than taught.” 
“That’s right, professor,” sighed the youth, subsid­
ing heavily, “you teach me—I feed myself.”—Cleve­
land Plain Dealer.
