College Requirements Discussed 
No Clear Consensus Reached
David Caney Made 
Tartan Editor 1970
David Caney. sub-senior in the 
Architecture Department and ed­
itor of the Relative Truth, was 
elected Tuesday night by the Tar­
tan stall for the position ot editor- 
in-chief 1970-71. David will as­
sume responsibility of the paper 
as of the Tuesday. April 14. is­
sue.
Recognizing the difference be­
tween the two campus newspa­
pers. David hopes to use The Tar­
tan to develop a spirit of com­
munity on campus.
David, in his four years at Car- 
negie-Mellon University, has serv­
ed on the Architecture Depart­
ment Student Faculty Commit­
tee. the Food Service Review 
Committee, as co-initiator and re­
searcher in polyurtethane build­
ing systems in urban housing re­
search project, and as founder 
and editor of the Relative Truth. 
In addition, he participated in the 
early tormative meetings of the 
Activities Board and was the stu­
dent leader of the fall demonstra­
tions in support ot the Black Con­
struction Coalition.
In presenting hi> statement of 
intent to the Tartan staff and 
members ot Student Senate Tues­
day. David indicated that he hopes 
to foster a sense ot understanding 
and community by informing stu­
dents and faculty ot exactly what 
they can expect and where they 
>tand in that community by pub-
lishing such things as a resource 
allocation breakdown by depart­
ment. showing per student fund­
ing. professor's teaching loads, 
and other such investigatory re­
porting.
An all-college meeting ot the Humanities and So­
cial Sciences School was held Wednesday afternoon 
in the Morewood Hec Room to discuss the various 
proposals for alternative requirement policies tor 
the new college. In addition. Joel Goldstein, moder­
ator ot the meeting, said that he hoped the meeting 
would result in "a community spirit, since every­
body must live with the policy finally decided upon.
After a statement ot the meeting's purpose, the 
group broke up into ten smaller sections composed 
of students, faculty members and administrators. 
Each group was assigned the task of coming to a 
consensus on a proposal which they thought the Col­
lege Committee should adopt at their meeting 
Thursday afternoon.
Each committee reported back to a general ses­
sion after two hours of discussions. The suggestions 
were varied, many insisting that the College drop 
all requirements, some advocating an area-distri- 
bution requirement system. At the end of the meet­
ing. Dean Steinberg stated that the College Commit­
tee would consider the result of the meeting to be 
majority agreement on a no-requirement system. 
But many dissenting voices were heard.
The content ot the discussion groups differed. 
Some concerned themselves with grading systems, 
others with philosophies of education, some with 
the role of counseling and advisors. One thing was 
clear, however—most of the freshmen currently 
enrolled in the experimental college were dis­
turbed about their first year in college and were 
sincerely worried about the direction the College 
would now adopt.
Group Reports
Students are basically selfish It they aren t 
now. they will be. said the reporter from the first
group His group proposed that the College institute 
a no-requirement system with "strong advisor " 
support. He indicated that the advisors should be 
more than 'free seminar preceptors " and that they 
should be in contact with incoming freshmen betore 
they arrive.
The second group supported proposals 1. II. and 
IV of the proposal that was printed in the April 7 ed­
ition of the Tartan. In addition, they recommended 
that treshmen should be notified of the require­
ments and the courses available before they arrive. 
The group also suggested that a period of auditing 
be instituted for several days before classes offi­
cially begin.
Although the third group did not reach a consen­
sus. a majority agreed that a defined proportion of 
a student's courses should be taken outside his 
major
No college requirements was the recommenda­
tion from the fourth task force. They. too. recom­
mend that an advisory corps be set up
In the fifth group, one-halt of the members fav­
ored the proposal as presented in the Tartan. The 
others advocated a flexible area requirement sys­
tem which would extend over the entire four-year 
period All area requirements should be limited to 
one semester courses, they added.
Of the remaining groups, the suggestions were 
made to ill eliminate core requirements and sub­
stitute area distinctions: i2i institute i no-require- 
ment program on an experimental basis for one 
year; i3> have area requirements but i student 
may take a test to place out ot particular discipline; 
i4> experiment for one year by having some stu­
dents follow the defined program and others follow

EDITORIAL
“Your last one, isn’t it?” they say as they stop by the 
office. You nod, and turn back to your typewriter trying to 
evaluate the past year, attempting to communicate what it 
has meant to be the Editor-in-Chief. A blank piece of paper 
sits there, staring, slugged at the top “last editorial, double 
column, 10 on 12.”
The last one. There have been many, some right, some 
you perhaps wish you had not written, others you wish you 
had. But all of them were based on honest convictions and 
the facts at hand.
Some battles have been won. Apathy has been overcome 
in some instances. Accomplishments and progress have been 
made... but there’s so much left to do.
They walk by, lean on the door jamb, talking about the 
past, wondering about the future. They ask you what it’s 
like. . . the last one. You’ve been wondering about that too 
and even now you don’t know.
Outside people are hammering away on typewriters, re­
writing and writing copy. Inevitably, someone brings in a late 
story that’s “very important.” Where are we goint to put it? 
You make a quick decision. But it’s probably the last time.
What should I say to my successor? I’m still too close to 
my own efforts to evaluate what I have accomplished. But 
maybe I can tell him just a few things.
David, your work, the way you fulfill this responsibility, 
will depend quite a bit on how you evaluate, constructively, 
this year’s paper. You will be expected to maintain our gains, 
and to improve on your flaws.
Don’t be afraid of someone who accuses you of not know­
ing what you are talking about. You are in a position to 
keep many things in perspective. You won’t and can’t begin 
to know it all; but you will often find that many of those who 
accuse you of not knowing will come to you for information.
Try to be open-minded about positions other than your 
own. I don’t mean don’t hold an opinion. Make a considered 
judgment and then stick to it. If facts prove you wrong, an 
open mind will than allow you to change your stand. To have 
no opinion is not having an open mind; it’s having no mind 
at all.
Try to be as objective as possible. Of course, simply by 
the facts you include and reject you are being subjective. 
But objectivity is a goal which can and should be strived for. 
Your audience will appreciate it if you try to keep your 
editorial opinion confined to the editorial page.
So back to today. Time is moving on, others will be tak­
ing over, you and your ideas are forgotten. . . but the news­
paper lives and flourishes.
The sun is setting behind the cut. You’re late to dinner 
again. Perhaps it’s for the last time, for now you can be 
just another student. But one who can truthfully say that the 
years have past and I have lived them.
And remember Mr. Valiant-for-Truth in “Pilgrim’s Pro­
gress” who said, “My sword to him that follows me; my cour­
age to him that can get it.”
And that’s
THIRTY.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Protest Continuation Of War On April 15th
Editor. The Tartan:
It is a half a year since the 
first moratorium. The war con­
tinues and expands with no end 
in sight. Conditions at home are 
getting worse with such notic-
able problems as inflation. The 
represeive atmosphere is at a 
new peak; the Conspiracy trial 
made this clear as does the trial 
of Panther 21. Citizens of the 
country are made to pay through 
taxes, blood, and sacrifice of ba-
sic freedoms while the establish­
ment profits. If you don't like the 
situation that exists as I have 
briefly desctibed let your voice 
be heard on April 15th.
Peace and freedom.
Jimmy Margulies
ROTC Programs Should Be Made Voluntary
Editor: The Tartan:
On February 15. the national 
Board of Directors of the Amer­
ican Civil Liberties Union adop­
ted a policy statment calling for 
certain specific reforms respec­
ting ROTC. The full statement 
was:
'The ACLU has taken the 
position that: 1. Where ROTC 
programs exist, they should be 
completely voluntary. Com­
pulsory participation. . . chal­
lenges the concept of an open 
university. When ROTC is now 
compulsory by university regu­
lation. we urge revocation; where 
it is imposed by state law. we
urge the institution to. . . press 
for repeal. 2. Academic credit 
should be granted only for those 
ROTC courses which are accept­
able to and under the control of 
the regular faculty. 3. ROTC 
instructors should not hold 
academic rank unless they are 
members of a normal academic 
department subject to regular 
procedures of appointment 
and dismissal. 4. ROTC pro­
grams should fully observe the 
practice of the university or col­
lege regarding any keeping of 
records which relate or refer to 
political, religious or social 
views or associations of the stu­
dents. in harmony with ACLU
standards expressed in the pam­
phlet on academic freedom for 
college and university students.
“ROTC programs which 
fail to meet these standards 
would undermine the values of 
free inquiry and academic auto­
nomy which are at the heart 
of academic freedom and should 
be eliminated in institutions of 
higher learning."
Yours very truly,

ACLU Studies Academic Freedom Problems
Editor. The Tartan
The Academic Freedom Com­
mittee of the American Civil 
Liberties Union has just conclud­
ed a two-year study of the aca­
demic freedom „problems arising 
out of university involvement in 
federally-subsidized contract re­
search projects. In accordance 
with its findings and conclusions, 
and as a reflection of its con­
cern, the Committee has recom­
mended the adoption of the 
following policy resolutions:
1. Secret research is contrary 
to the kind of free circulation of 
ideas that should prevail in an 
intellectual and academic com­
munity. and should have no place 
on a university campus. Univer­
sities should not accept grants 
or enter into agreements for the 
support of instruction or research 
which confer upon any external
party, public or private, power 
to censor or to exercise effective 
veto on: (a) the contents of in­
struction or research <b) the
publication or other dissemina­
tion of results and conclusions 
arising from instruction or re­
search.
2. Any work not open to the
critical judgment of one's pro­
fessional peers should not be
used as a crierion for evalua­
tion toward promotion, tenure 
or a degree. All participation 
in such work should be separate 
from the usual academic respon­
sibilities.
3. The university should enter 
no contract and accept no grant 
that involves the loyalty or secur­
ity clearance of any person in­
volved in the project. The selec­
tion of personnel for research 
work should be completely with-
in the purview of the university 
and its faculty.
4. Universities should dissoci­
ate themselves from the Insti­
tute for Defense- Analysis and 
should not be a party to the for­
mation of similar organizations 
in the future. It is a perversion 
of the mission of the academy 
for a university to lend its pres­
tige and the prestige of its scho­
lars to an enterprise engaged in 
research that is designed to ac­
complish some other agency's 
purpose and has little or no per­
tinence to the interests or pur­
suit of scholarship.
Yours very truly,

Alternative Liberal Arts Program Proposed
Editor. Tartan.
In Friday's (April 3rd Editor­
ial you state, in reference to the 
discussion of the curriculum for 
H&SS. that "The course selected 
must depend on the individual s 
needs and goals. . ." Your pro­
posal. however, is for a system 
of ‘distribution requirements" 
similar to the program at Pitt. 
While this is better than the 
present "core requirements" 
which stipulate specific courses. 
I do not think it is a significant 
improvement, because it assumes 
that "the individual’s needs" 
will never conflict with taking 
courses in th% fields you men­
tioned. that is. English. Math. 
History and Social Sciences. I 
think this assumption is invalid.
Instead. I would propose an 
alternative course of study to 
the current ones offered bv I1&SS.
Why not, in addition to all the 
existing programs, have one 
which is similar to but less struc­
tured than the present "self­
defined major"? I will call it 
the "self-non-defined major". 
It's characteristics would be: 
absolutely no requirements 
other than completing 360 units 
study; credit to be given for 
any reasonable activity proposed 
by the student, including travel, 
and work experience; a student 
can enter the program at any­
time during his four years at 
school, without "losing credits "; 
finally, the degree given would 
be called Bachelor of Arts in 
Liberal Arts.
This proposal is different from 
the existing self-defined major in 
what it does not require that 
the student know exactly what 
he wants to do.
It is entirely compatible 
with the present curriculum of 
H&SS. All existing majors (His­
tory, English, etc.) could be re­
tained as they are or however 
they might be modified.
It could be tried out on a 
provisional basis to determine its 
popularity. (It has been fairly 
successful at schools such as 
Antioch and Goddard, among 
others, i
Finally. I believe it is an es­
sential part of any educational 
system which hopes to cope 
with the complex needs of many 
alienated people, needs which 
are not met. indeed not even 
considered relevant, by the pres­
ent system.

Faculty Compensation Tables Made Public
The question of how much of a 
student s tuition is fed back into 
his college in terms of faculty sal­
aries has floated around all year. 
In the beginning of the fall term 
James Langer. chairman of the 
Faculty Senate, received a prom­
ise from Dr. Edward Schatz that, 
for the first time, a comparative 
table of faculty members per col­
lege would be made public.
The five tables presented here 
show average and minimum C-MU
compensation comparisons for
1969-70. Compensations »salaries 
plus fringe benefits) are computed 
for each college and compared to 
AAUP standards and the compen­
sations for previous years.
Table I gives average academ­
ic year compensation for 1969-
70. The compensations of cer­
tain deans and vice-presidents 
who also hold academic titles are 
not included in the figures. In this 
table and all succeeding tables.
compensations have been deter­
mined by adding to salaries a 
fringe benefit portion calculated 
by using the percentages indi­
cated in the footnotes.
Table II gives minimum com­
pensation data. AAUP instruc­
tions permit the omission of a cer­
tain number of compensations in 
determining minum ratings. Un­
der the rules. C-MU is permitted 
eight omissions.^The eight omis- 
sions^are not included in date in
Tables II and V. On the other hand, 
all compensations have been in­
cluded in the data on averages in 
Tables I and IV.
Table III gives the number of 
faculty members below AAUP 
standards for 1969-70 and for 
four preceding years. Tables IV 
and V give compensation com­
parisons with five preceding 
years.
The data that salaries at C-MU 
have been and are set to meet
'market conditions.” Thus, fur­
ther comparisons with other insti­
tutions and particular units of 
other institutions are of great im­
portance.
C-MU will not participate fully 
in AAUP salary studies until 
197,-71. For 1970-71. AAUP 
will abandon its AA to G ratings 
and substitute a new decile rating 
system one to nine for average 
compensations. Minimum ratings 
will be abandoned altogether.

Chance for Black Power?
As the featured entertainment of this year’s Spring Carnival Weekend, 
YHE CHAMBERS BROTHERS will appear in concert Friday night, 
April 17, at 8:30 in the Syria Mosque. Tickets are available at the Skibo 
Information Desk for the reduced price of $4.50. The other weekend ac­
tivities are free.
By William Russell Robinson
If there is a lesson in Ameri­
ca’s pluralistic history, it is that 
the ability of an outcast minor­
ity to advance in the face of 
majority prejudices partly de­
pends on its ability to develop 
countervailing power. It is 
extraordinary that so conven­
tional an idea has evoked so bit­
ter a controversy in the United 
States.
Indeed, those institutions in 
the Black community which are 
•integrated” - whether political 
orgainzations, the rackets, or 
social welfare agencies -actually 
contribute to Black impotence, 
for they are integrated only in 
the sense that they are domin­
ated by whites and serve white 
interests.
Afro-Americans compose 42 
percent of the private house­
hold work force and 25 percent 
of nonfarm laborers. Poor Blacks, 
in brief, are being shut out of 
the economic system. They have 
progressed from slave labor to 
cheap labor to no labor at all.
Worse yet. manifestly egalitar­
ian measures have been turned 
against the poor. Federal agri­
cultural subsidies established to 
aid all farmers, actually helped 
to bankrupt small ones. The 
Housing Act of 1949 asserted 
the right of every American to 
a “decent and standard dwelling
Phi Beta
Faculty members of the na­
tional honorary society Phi Beta 
Kappa will organize themselves 
at a meeting next Tuesday to 
begin the process of bringing a 
chapter to the C-MU campus. 
Now that a separate College of 
Humanities and Social Sci­
ences is a reality and a separate 
college of science has been pro­
posed (to be called the Mellon 
Institute of Science), the time 
seems appropriate for establish­
ing the best-known of a national

campus. Tau Beta Pi. the na­
tional engineering honorary, is 
already represented here.
Charters for chapters of Phi 
Beta Kappa are awarded trien-
Promotio
Senate on Tuesday began to 
drive for student membership in 
faculty promotion committees 
across campus. Dr. Schatz was 
present to hear President Pat­
rick Cavanaugh submit the fol­
lowing motion:
Whereas we feel that direct 
student input to faculty pro­
motion decisions is an essential 
part of the education process. . . 
We request that the Vice presi­
dent of Academic Affairs: 1.
grant student membership on the 
Committee on Promotion and 
Tenure, and 2. urge individual 
departments to seat students on 
the departmental faculty promo­
tion committees.
In the forty minutes of discus­
sion that followed. Dr. Schatz 
explained, among other things, 
the three-leveled promotion pro­
cedure-departmental promotion 
committees that make recom­
mendations to college-level com­
mittees which then forward 
their decisions to the All Uni­
versity Committee on Promo­
tion and Tenure
unit”, but initiated the Urban 
Renewal Program that destroyed
350,000 low-renting housing units 
in the course of reclaiming slum 
neighborhoods for commercial 
facilities and better-off resi­
dents.
Moreover, corporate enter­
prise can now take a benevo­
lent stance towards Blacks be­
cause it no longer has a major 
stake in domestic racism. At 
an earlier stage of production, 
racism helped to depress the 
cost of labor by ensuring a sup­
ply of cheap Black workers as 
well as a supply of scabs to 
inhibit union organizing among 
whites. But labor costs are now 
a less important factor in pro­
fits, and union organization has 
turned out to be an advantage 
in stabilizing and regulating the 
work force. Racism is no longer 
an economic asset; by threaten­
ing social stability, it has be­
come a liability.
Acquiring access to white in­
stitutions is one way to advance; 
developing Black institutional 
relationship to the society is 
another and more important 
way. Separatist institutional de­
velopment will not take place 
quickly, but in the long run its 
effects should be profound, for 
nothing about the Afro com­
munity is more conspicuous

nially after an institution applies 
and is visited by one or more of 
the members of the Qualifica­
tions Committee of the national 
organization. The next triennium 
ends in 1972: in order to receive 
a chapter C-MU has to make a 
preliminary application prior to 
October 15. Since not all insti­
tutions which apply can be vis­
ited during the triennium. it 
may require more than three 
years to obtain a chapter.
Phi Beta Kappa requires that 
institutions with chapters em­
phasize 'curricula definitely li­
beral in character and purpose." 
Although all of C-MU's curricu­
la meet this definition, most are 
vocational as well. Hence, there
The main point of the dis­
cussion centered on how best to 
overcome the anticipated strong 
faculty resistance to the move. 
The original proposal involved 
initially obtaining membership 
on the All University Commit­
tee to allow faculty to grow ac­
customed to student participa­
tion and to move from there to 
the departmental level.
Dr. Schatz considered this 
unadivisable for two reasons. 
First, the faculty is generally 
opposed to the All University 
Committee as they feel that 
promotion decisions should be 
made only at the departmental 
level. Second, much more ef­
fective student input is possible 
at the departmental level be­
cause. as Dr. Schatz pointed 
out. decisions not to renew con­
tracts or not to promote do not 
reach the All University level. 
A further consideration was that 
students would be participating 
in decisions in their own de­
partment at the lowest level, 
while the cross-section of stu-
than the absence of its own 
institutions (save the church). In 
part, this condition is a heritage 
of slavery and of laws passed 
in the wake of Reconstruction 
which prohibited free assembly 
and the formation of associa­
tions among Blacks. The tra­
ditional isolation of most Blacks 
in rural and feudalistic settings 
has also inhibited the formation 
of institutions, especially of a 
kind that would be viable in the 
city.
Judging from the past, pro­
grams for Blacks will be de­
signed to treat their presumed 
deficiencies - to engender "good 
work habits and incentives.” 
strengthen family life, improve 
mental health.
The Black poor. then, have 
few prospects for political or 
economic advancement. Because 
of the current disruptions, they 
will get few concessions to re­
store tranquility. But once the 
cities are tranquillized, what 
then? As we have said, the 
main chance for Black power is 
in the cities, but the odds are 
lengthening. If there is a ques­
tion to be debated, it is not 
whether the idea of Black 
power is desirable: it is whether 
the power of this idea can pre­
vail in the face of the continu­
ing centralization of corporate 
and federal power over the city.
Campus
are a number of questions 
about student eligibility which 
would have to be resolved before 
a charter could be received. For 
this reason, a meeting of mem­
bers of Phi Beta Kappa cur­
rently serving on the C-MU 
Faculty has been called for 
11:30 a.m. on Tuesday. April 
14 in the History Seminar 
Room (Baker Hall 245A). At 
this time an organization will 
be created to apply for a char­
ter. Any faculty member, gra­
duate student, or alumnus who 
is a member of Phi Beta Kappa 
is urged to attend or to get in 
touch with Dr. Harold Burstyn 
of the History Department, who 
is convening the meeting.
dents would not be so represen­
tative on the All University 
Committee.
When asked. Dr. Schatz stated 
that he felt that students had an 
important input to make to the 
promotion process. His opinion, 
however, was that this input 
should not necessarily be through 
the promotion committees. Facul­
ty would probably fear that stu­
dent input would bring a popu­
larity contest element into pro­
motions. Senators expressed se­
vere doubts that this would hap­
pen and pointed out that faculty 
promotions are already danger­
ously subject to popularity con­
siderations by the faculty itself.
The motion and possible ac­
tions to be taken were referred 
to Student Government's Aca­
demic Affairs* Board. Director 
Ken Friend will attempt to ga­
ther as much information as 
possible about the promotion 
structure in the various de­
partments and how best to ap­
proach gaining student member-

At Tuesday's meeting, the Stu­
dent Senated acted on President 
Pat Cavanagh's motion of the 
week before by forming an intern­
al Senate committee to study the 
possibility of incorporation Stu­
dent Government, and to work on 
obtaining facilities which would 
be under the autonomous control 
of SG. The need for such a Student 
Union is evident in view of the 
many differences which have oc­
curred recently between the Uni­
versity and students upon the use 
of University facilities. A discus­
sion of the many possible func­
tions of such a Student Union and 
the steps toward obtaining it will 
be presented in the Tartan soon.

Senate Discusses, Acts
by Vincent J. Misitano, Jr.
For the second meeting in a 
row the new senate found it­
self considering very controver­
sial issues. The first, an extreme­
ly touch one. was brought up 
by new President Pat Cavanaugh 
in his motion to place students 
on Faculty-Promotion Commit­
tees. A lengthy discussion cen­
tered around whether or not stu­
dents should have a voice in 
hiring and firing teachers. 
This motion was finally tabled 
to the Academic Affairs Board 
to be given careful considera­
tion before Senate action. An 
equally dynamic discussion re­
sulted from a motion to have 
Student Senate support the H&SS 
students' 'Proposal for Student- 
Directed Education ". (This pro­

ate by several students, who have 
been engaged in an extensive 
battle to have the college meet 
their demands. After asking 
questions of the students and 
discussing many aspects of the 
controversy, the Senate gave a 
firm stamp of approval on the 
proposal. Other actions taken by 
Senate included a reappropria­
tion of $635 to Patterns, and the 
formation of a Student-Union

Still in the process of or­
ganizing itself, the new Senate 
elected Vince Misitano as assist­

Voluntary Counselors 
Needed in Moreivood
by Alex Cummings
The administration recently decided to eliminate floor counselors 
in Morewood Gardens. However, it is obvious that these floor counse­
lors serve a very important function in the dormitory. First, they act 
as a communication liason between AVVS. Housing, and the house moth­
ers and the girls on their floors. Second, they help to familiarize the 
freshmen with C-i\llT during orientation and the beginning of the year.
So. in order to replace the floor counselors. AWS has instituted a 
program of volunteer floor counselors. AVVS has instituted a program 
of volanteer floor managers for Morewood Gardens. These girls will 
be responsible to AVVS and act under the tower presidents and vice- 
presidents. having meetings periodically with the tower presidents.
They will also have the opportunity to meet with Dean Swank and the 
men s counselors to discuss campus issues. They will serve as a com­
munication liason between AVVS and the girls in the dormitory and will 
also help with orientation of freshmen. As a reward for their service, 
these girls have been given choice of room on the floor where they will 
serve. Because of the unique situations in Welch Hall and Mudge B" 
wing, it was decided that their elected representatives would perform 
the duties of floor manager.

As the second Existence of 
God ' seminar. David Wojick. a 
graduate student in philosophy at 
Pitt, put forward a carefully rea­
soned defense ol atheism. His 
starting point was to treat the ex­
istence of God as analogous to a 
scientific hypothesis useful in ex­
plaining experimental data. After 
a careful discussion of the sense 
in which a typical scientific hypo­
thesis "explains" and event, he 
listed possible "events" which 
the God-hypothesis purports to 
explain: the existence of the uni­
verse. of man. man's moral 
religious experience, man's ra­
tionality. and miracles. Criteria 
for choosing among competing 
hypothesis—simplicity, economy, 
and power of prediction — were 
set forth next, and Wojick claimed 
that in terms of these criteria 
there are alternative and super­
ior (to ’God exists") hypothesis

Due to the questions raised by 
participants, resulting in interest­
ing digressions on topics such as 
the intelligibility of evolution and 
the intelligence of porpoises. Wo- 
jick s presentation lasted over an 
hour. In the discussion following 
he was asked to explain why. if 
the arguments for the existence 
of God framed in a scientific 
way " are so unsound, there are 
scientists who believe in the exis­
tence of God and are willing to 
defend this belief. He replied that 
many scientitsts have little phil­
osophical sophistication, that they 
may be arguing for the existence 
of God in some non-rational sense, 
that the implications of God s ex­
istence have never clearly been 
spelled out. and that in any case 
one becomes a believer or a non­
believer on bases other than ra­
tional considerations. Most of 
these assertions were immedi­
ately challenged, and the ensuing 
discussion (lasting well after the 
seminar had formally ended) will 
presumably continue at the semi­
nar meeting on Monday. March 16. 
at 9 p.m. in room 115. MMCC.

Waynesburg, Loses 74-71
^ The CMU tennis team opened 
its season with two victories, 
6-3 over Western Reserve on Sat­
urday and 8-1 over Grove City 
on Tuesday. March Krotee has 
replaced Dave Lichtman as 
coach and has a good chance to 
improve on last season's excel­
lent 9-1 record.
Winning matches for CMU Sat­
urday were J°e Gordon, Phil 
Myers. Bader Wahedi, and Steve 
Forman in singles, and the 
double teams of Rich Smith- 
Myersand Gordon-Forman.
It was a little wet at Grove 
City but the conditions didn’t 
bother the Tartans at all. The 
only Tartan losing was newcom­
er Sol Swartz, with the rest of 
¿he squad having a relatively 
"asy time.
Coach Drotee is looking op­
timistically to the future of the 
Tennis team. The only senior on 
the squad is Joe Gordon and 
the only member graduating 
from last year’s squad was Mike 
Smolens.
Sophomore Javed Khan is re­
turning is the number one singles 
*layer and Gordon, Myers, Wa­
hedi, and Chuck Anderson add 
experience to the squad. Other 
members who saw action so far 
this season are Rich Smith, 
Swartz, and Forman.
The tennis team played Indi­
ana yesterday and travels to 
Westminster on Saturday.

The Tartans turned in magni­
ficent performances on the track 
while fighting Waynesburg Sat­
urday. leaving the outcome in 
doubt until the last event. Un­
fortunately, fewer misses gave 
the' Yellow Jackets the high 
jump and the score was 74-71.
The meet opened with a break 
for C-MU as the Waynesburg 
lead-off man in the 440 relay 
fell at the exchange, effectively 
ending the race. Jon Manon 
then continued his sophomore 
career on the track where he 
left off in cross-country last 
fall, winning the mile in an 
excellent 4:30. Waynesburg's 
multi-talented Nichlow followed 
the mile with the first of his 
two hurdle victories, evening 
the score a bit. C-MU stunned 
everyone by sweeping the short
sprint, and later, the 220, with 
Mike Fotta leading the pack in 
both races. Nichlow’s win in the 
broad jump and the loss of the 
880 and 440 hurdles temporarily 
dampened Coach Mecklev’s day. 
but Manon stormed to a 9:56 
two-mile (three seconds off the 
51-year-old Tech record) and 
Houck of C-MU set a new school 
record in the triple jump (41- 
lV’) to tie the score again.
The main problem was that 
Waynesburg was having its usual 
strong day in the field events, 
losing only the triple jump and 
pole vault (to Erskine). The 
score was 65-62 C-MU going into 
the last two events, but the jave­
lin was lost and although both 
C-MU’s Miller and Waynesburg's 
English cleared 510”. Miller 
had one miss at that height and 
thus was defeated.
