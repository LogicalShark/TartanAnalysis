New, -Renewed 
^Scholarships 
Must Be Filed
All students seeking finan­
cial aid, whether for the first 
time or for renewal, must fill 
out an application.
Applications are available from 
the financial aid office, room 154- 
B, Baker Hall, (formerly Admini- 
^ stration Hall).
They must be mailed to Prince­
ton, New Jersey or Berkley, Cal., 
before March 15, it was an­
nounced by Philip R. Blake, head 
of Financial Aid to Students.
This is the first time that those 
wishing to renew scholarships 
must also apply. This is because 
the renewal analysis, formerly 
done by Carnegie Tech, is now 
being done by the Princeton v bureau.
Freshmen especially are re­
minded to apply for their scholar­
ship renewals, regardless of the 
type of scholarship they now pos­
sess. Applications are also re­mind to be sure to fill out all 
pages of the application.

Editorial
We Thank You, ‘Jake’
Dr. John C. Warner retires in two weeks. He leaves 
Carnegie Tech after 15 years as president.
Dr. Warner has become an integral part of the Carnegie 
Tech world. His retirement climaxes the end of 38 years of 
service on the Carnegie Tech faculty.
An instructor of chemistry in 1926, he moved up the 
academic ranks to become professor of chemistry and head 
of the Department of Chemistry in 1938, and dean of Gradu­
ate Studies in 1945.
When Dr. Warner assumed the presidency of Carnegie 
Tech in 1950, he recognized the school’s need for improved 
physical facilities. To help fulfill these needs he initiated 
fund-raising drives and a development program. We today 
are benefitting from Dr. Warner’s efforts.
Since Dr. Warner became president, 14 new buildings 
have been constructed including new men’s dormitories, and 
an addition to Morewood Gardens.
Before his inauguration as president, Dr. Warner explain­
ed his attitude toward the academic program at Carnegie 
Tech:
“As a member of the faculty and an administrative 
officer at Carnegie, I have had part in charting our course; 
therefore I am glad to say that I am in full sympathy with 
and eager to carry forward both CIT’s fundamental program 
of education and its present policy of balance among fund­
amental research, graduate education, and undergraduate 
education ...”
During his presidency, Dr. Warner has spent more than 
a good deal of his time in attempting to improve the cur 
ricula.
In addition, the retiring president has raised faculty 
salaries over 100% during his term. This has encouraged more 
participation by educators in the school’s academic life.
To quote George K. Brown, Dean of Student Affairs. 
“Dr. Warner has had a very deep interest in students both 
in their academic pursuits and their out of classroom activi­
ties.”
It was the president's feeling, in 1956, that the organiza 
tion of student government was ineffective. It did not give 
as much personal freedom to students as they could assume. 
Because of his suggestions, the government system was re­
vised.Also, as a result of his leadership, students now have a 
student activities center, a football stadium, and a lighted 
intra-mural field.
Back in 1949 Dr. Doherty, Carnegie Tech president from 
1936 until 1950, said of Dr. Warner, “Because of my intimate 
knowledge of his administrative ability, stemming from his 
integrity, forthrightness, and sound judgment, I congratulate 
CIT on the prospect of his leadership in years ahead.”
And we today congratulate Dr. John Christian Warner 
for having been a Carnegie Tech president worthy of this 
praise.

Library To Open Till Midnight; 
Schatz Accepts Faculty Survey
by Sue Attinson
Hunt Library hours will be extended on a trial basis 
?beginning February 3.
The library will remain open 
until midnight Monday through 
Thursday.
Finals Seen By Profs 
¦ As Means Of Evaluation
by Candy Etkin
According to Dr. Edwin Steinberg, dean of Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College, final examinations are an evalua­
tion device, useful to demonstrate what knowledge the stu­
dent has acquired from his course. “A good final exam con­
taining challenging questions, is a useful teaching instrument. 
It should enable the student to think through the whole
Students Favor 
Penn B Plan
For ’66-’67
Preliminary results of the 
Tech Calendar Poll, show stu­
dent preference for the “Penn 
B” plan.
The poll was organized so' that 
each que-stionaire represented 30 students.
84 of the 100 distributed ques- 
tionaires have been returned. 68 
of these favor the “Penn B” plan.
Students also showed prefer­
ences for a spring recess and also 
a vacation 'on Spring Carnival 
Friday rather than on Good Fri­day.
The Carnegie Tech Calender 
Committee will meet tomorrow to 
evaluate the student poll and fac­
ulty opinion. The committee, 
headed by George K. Brown, dean 
of Student Affairs, will consist of 
faculty representatives from each 
college, the president of Student 
Congress, Joe Sandulli, and the 
chairman of the student Calendar 
Committee, Vernon Leicht.
It is expected that a prelim­
inary decision will be made con­
cerning the, calendar for 1966-67.
course.Final exams will be given to 
Carnegie Tech students from Fri­
day, January 5, to Saturday, Jan­
uary 23.Exams were scheduled by com­
puter. Priority was given to exams with large enrollments 
such as History of Western Civili­
zation and freshman chemistry in 
order to insure the completion of 
grading in the allotted time. The 
computer was used to eliminate 
the possibility of conflicts.
“We are committed to grades,” 
stated Dr. Steinberg. “A student 
is usually evaluated on his class 
participation, written papers, class 
exams, and the final examination. 
In Margaret Morrison the final 
has a varying effect on grades. 
There is no set rule.”
“The effect of finals on grades 
vary,” according to Richard A. 
Wells, assistant dean for fresh­
man, Engineering and Science.
“Finals, however, usually produce 
higher grades.”
Students in Architecture and 
Graphic. Arts have few written 
finals. Final projects are a major 
determination of grades. Final 
exams are given to students in 
music. Drama students have few 
written exams and various test 
performances.
Rooms For Study
Rooms 44, 45, 46, 54, 55, and 56 
will be opened for study until 
midnight during the week of 
finals.
It was reported last week by 
Dr. Dale E. Strick, Coordinator of 
Student Activities, that the Skibo 
Cafeteria would not be open as 
previously reported in the Tartan.
The cafeteria does not provide 
enough light for adequate study­
ing.
1965 ‘Thistle’
To Go On Sale
by Eiissa Parker
The 1965 Thistle will go on 
sale for one week at the be­
ginning of next semester.
Order forms will be distributed 
in front of Skibo, Baker Hall, 
Doherty Hall, and Margaret Mor­
rison on February 2.
The yearbook price will be $7, 
as it has been in previous years. 
A $4 deposit will be accepted, the 
rest to be paid in the fall. There 
will be a 75c mailing charge for books that are to be sent off cam­
pus. These books must be paid for
lull.
Nc orders will be accepted after February 6.
According to Tod Johnson, edi- 
tor-in-chief of the Thistle, the 
1965 hook will have many new 
features.
It will be square in shape and 
color pictures will be used. The 
introductory section will be in 
the form of a graphic and literary 
essay, and the sports copy will 
be more extensive.
Group portraits will represent 
organizations.
In summarizing, Johnson says: 
“The entire book wiil be focusing on the human element.”
See Editorial, Page 4
Transcript Requests
Requests for transcripts should 
be made to the Registrar's Office 
approximately one week in ad­vance of the needed date. Prints 
requested by Thursday at 3:30 
p.m. will be ready for distribution 
on the following Tuesday morning.
The week’s notice is necessary 
because records are now on mag­
netic tape. This... necessitates 
scheduling computer time.
All library services will be 
terminated at 9 p.m. on these 
nights. Reserved books will be signed out between 8 p.m., and 
9 p.m. Briefcases will be checked by security officers after 9 p.m.
Four students and two security, 
officers will substitute for the reg­
ular libraiy personnel during the
9 p.m. to midnight extension pè- riod.
Morewood residents will be able to make use of the library facili­
ties until several minutes before midnight. -
Women’s Dormitory Council 
voted to extend the weeknight 
curfews for spohomores and jun­
iors to midnight. This change in 
regulations will become effective February 3.
Though their regular 10 p.m. week-night curfews will be main­
tained, freshmen will be given 
special permission to study in the 
library until midnight. According 
to Mrs. Helen Thorpe, resident 
head of Morewood Gardens, fresh­
men women were not given a 
blanket extension on their cur­few because they “probably need 
somewhat more limits” than do the upperclass women.
The final decision to extend 
library hours was made Decem­
ber 18 by Dr. Edward R. Schatz, 
Vice-President for Academic Af­fairs.
The problem of library hours 
had been considered for several 
months by members of the ad­
ministration and library staff. A 
faculty committee studied library 
hours at other comparable in­
stitutions and conducted a count 
of the number of students using 
library facilities between 9 and10 p.m.
They also sponsored a special 
cost survey. According to Mary 
Scarlott, Associate Librarian, it 
was found that major costs in 
extending the hours would be 
for electricity and pèrsonnel.
The faculty committee’s final 
recommendation to Dr. Schatz 
specified that library hours be 
extended on a trial basis. Library 
counts, taken between 10 p.m. and 
midnight, would indicate the ade­quacy of student usage.
Dr. Schatz attributes strong 
student opinion as expressed by 
the Student Congress Library 
Committee and Tartan editorials 
as major influences on his accep­
tance of the faculty committee’s 
proposal.
Library hours will remain 9 
a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and 
2 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Sunday. 
kThe library will close at 9 p.m. 
on Friday.
Opera Tickets
Tickets for the Opera ‘Carmen* are now on sale in the office of 
the Dean of Fine Arts.
The opera will take place, to­
morrow and Saturday, at Syria 
Mosque. The price of tickets is 
$1.50 for Thursday and $1.95 or 
$2.10 for Saturday.
Curfews
During the mid-semester break 
Morewood residents, will have 
12:30 a.m. weeknight curfews. 
Their Friday and Saturday night 
curfews will be 1:30 a.m., as usual.

Times Have Changed
The Pittsburgh Press reported 
that in Germany in the Middle 
Ages, professors’ salaries were 
partly paid in fruit and wine.
But they had to press the grapes 
themselves and thus often missed 
lectures — causing their students 
to complain.

Let’s discuss tomorrow
In science and technology, the accomplishments 
of today are but direction for tomorrow. Why?
Simply because resting on the accomplishments 
of today is a luxury we cannot afford.
In Communications Engineering, where 
others are content to modify, our mandate 
is to CREATE. 
In Electronic Data Processing Systems, 
where others are content to innovate, our 
mandate is to CREATE.
This, then, is the philosophy . . . the crux of 
intellectual thought ... at the National Security
Agency—where the concepts of tomorrow are the 
problems of today.
So let’s discuss the future... 
yours and ours
If you are a gifted and interested Engineer or 
Mathematician, we have much in common—including 
A COMPULSION TO SUCCEED.
Our future is contingent upon a constant input of 
new . . . and creative . . . scientific talent. . . the 
lifeline of any institution. Our success is embodied 
in the technical capabilities of our professional staff. 
To assure this, scientific employees are encouraged 
to pursue graduate studies at local universities 
under Agency sponsorship. Your future with NSA 
will entail education . . . early responsibility . . . 
and unusually challenging assignments.
Why? Because . . .
• We MUST create completely new kinds of 
communications equipments and systems embodying 
concepts and techniques THAT HAVE NO 
PRECEDENT . . . antennas, transmitters, receivers 
and terminal hardware of a most advanced design.
• We MUST assure the complete invulnerability
of message content through the novel . . . but never 
static . . . science of cryptology.
• We MUST develop special refinements for 
computers and electronic data processing systems
.. . experimenting with the latest semiconductors, > 
magnetic film and superconductive devices to provide 
new logic circuits and memory units for increased 
speed and capacity.
Interested? ... If so, then LET’S DISCUSS 
TOMORROW. Representatives of the National 
Security Agency will be on campus in the near future.

Editorial
Reform Achieved
Edward R. Schatz, Vice-President in charge of Academic 
Affairs, approved the bill passed by Student Congress calling 
for extended library hours.
The bill, proposed by the Student Library Committee, 
was passed unanimously on November 11. It needed adminis­
trative approval before funds could be allocated to bring the 
new schedule into effect.
The bill calls for a long-needed extension of library 
hours from 10 p.m. to midnight, Monday through Thursday.
Morewood curfews will be adjusted to allow women to 
benefit by the new schedule.
In its editorial of September 23, the Tartan pointed out 
the inadequacies of the present schedulè, expressing the need 
for longer hours, and adjustment of curfews when the stu­
dent needs them.
The Tartan reaffirmed its views on November 18 and 
urged swift and unreserved approval of the bill by the ad­
ministration.
After a comprehensive faculty investigation of the situa­
tion, Vice-President Schatz approved the bill.
This investigation confirmed the need for a new schedule, 
and indicated that such a change would be financially 
feasible.
The strong student opinion, expressed both in the Tartan 
editorials and in the recommendations of the student Library 
Committee, combined with the results of the faculty study 
could leave no room for doubt.
Vice-President Schatz’s approval of this bill will help 
to rectify the deficiencies in the library schedule, and take a 
step toward providing adequate study facilities for student 
use.
We appreciate the administration’s cooperation in help­
ing to achieve this goal.

Author Of Best Seller Says 
Mississippi A Closed Society
by James Panepinto
With the situation in Mississippi being as serious as it 
is, the recent visit of Dr. James Silver, author of Mississippi: 
The Closed Society, to Pittsburgh and to Tech proved to be 
both worthwhile and interesting.
Dr. Silver was the guest speak-*---------------------------------------------------------
er at a meeting of the American 
Civil Liberties Union of Pitts­
burgh, and also entertained a 
small group of Tech students and 
faculty earlier that day. Dr.
Silver’s book, which has been on 
the best seller lists for over three 
months, was only one of the topics 
of discussion.
“Mississippi will never, never 
reform itself from within,” Dr.
Silver declared in his afternoon 
discussion at Tech. The reason for 
this is what Silver terms the 
"closed society” in Mississippi.
The closed society is responsible 
for the position of Negroes in 
Mississippi today and its distin­
guishing features are items such 
as the biological inferiority of 
Negroes as a race and the subse­
quent superiority of whites, and 
the predominant social, political, 
and economic segregation present 
in Mississippi society.
These are only a tew of the 
features, but they all have one common characteristic: they are 
all intended to keep the Negro 
in the lowest possible position 
in the society of Mississippi.
The average Misslssippian, how­
ever, is a product of his environ­
ment and this looms as the major 
reason for his actions toward 
Negroes. Dr. Silver points out that 
a person living in Harlem is often 
excused from the crimes he com­
mits because of the influence on 
him of his interior environment;
Mississippians are just as much 
products of their environment but 
they are usually condemned with­
out understanding conditions such 
as this.The Mississippians charged with 
the murder of the three civil rights 
workers this summer are a prime 
example of this fact. A look at 
their backgrounds shows that they 
are the products of Mississippi’s closed society. That their actions 
will be as racially violent as they 
are is only to be expected.
This is certainly not a plea to 
• excuse the actions of all guilty 
persons. However, it is a fact that 
»me persons receive special con- ideration due to temporary in- 
ity and other related reasons, 
environment and social con-
ditions in Mississippi have pro­
duced permanent social norms which may be considered insane 
in comparison to the norms of 
some of us.
For example, one of the basic 
rules of behavior is that no white 
man will ever testify against an­other white in a crime against a 
Negro. It is not plausible to at­
tempt to incorporate a considera­
tion concerning this insanity into 
our law system, but in one’s own 
judgment of Mississippi, and the 
actions there, it should definitely 
be considered.
Silver goes as far as to say: 
“Eighty-seven and one-third per­
cent of the people of Mississippi 
voted for a man named Gold- 
water. If this isn’t irrefutable evi­
dence of the mental illness of 
Mississippi, nothing is.” This was 
a strong opinion, not a political 
joke. Silver believes this is an­
other indication of Mississippi’s 
inability to reform herself: by 
chosirig the wrong person for 
president for the wrong reasons. 
Most Missiissippians considered 
only the civil rights question in 
chosing Goldwater, a very stupid 
way to choose a person who will 
be the leader of the entire United 
States.
Through actions such as these, 
Mississippi will not eliminate the 
closed society, but she will further 
entrench it as a Mississippian way 
of life. The first force to affect 
Mississippi will be economic; in­
dustries today cannot be bothered 
by such extreme problems if they 
are to be successful. Industries 
have stopped entering Mississippi 
and some have begun leaving. 
Economic boycotts have been 
started by the few indignant 
whites that there are and by the 
few Negroes who can afford the 
risk.
Silver believes that these eco­
nomic forces will precipitate the 
breakdown of the closed society. 
Social norms will then begin to 
change to provide the atmosphere 
that is compatible with industry. Then the closed society will have 
a good start to becoming as "open” 
as any society may hope to be.

Claymore Clan to Hold 
Book Exchange Again
Editor, the Tartan:
- Claymore Clan, the Men’s Dor­
mitory Service Honorary, is 
pleased to announce that the bool» 
exchange held at the beginning of 
the school year will be repeated 
during the first few days of the 
second semester.
The purpose of the exchange 
is to give students the oppor­
tunity to buy used course books 
instead of the new books at high­
er prices; and also, the exchange 
gives students the chance to pro­
fitably dispose of books which 
they no longer need.
On Tuesday, February 2, the 
second day of registration, used 
books will be collected from 10:00 
a.m. to 5:00 p.m. in the front 
lobby of Baker Hall (AH). All 
books submitted for sale will be 
marked to sell at the price re­
quested by the owner plus a 5 
cent service charge; the money 
gained by the small service change 
will be used by Claymore Clan 
to defray the cost of operating 
the exchange.
Books will be sold on Thurs­
day and Friday, February 4 and 
5, from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. in 
45 Skibo.
Unsold books and money from 
sold books are to be claimed on 
Monday and Tuesday, February 
8 and 9, from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 
p.m., room 45, Skibo. All money 
must be claimed on these days.
Anyone having unneeded text­
books or paperbacks for courses 
taught second semester (for ex­
ample, Economics C715, World Lit 
C728, etc.) is invited to submit them for sale on February 2. 
Persons needing textbooks-are in­
vited to stop at room 45, Skibo 
to see if the books available might 
be used.
Claymore Clan hopes that this 
service is appreciated.

Congress Asks
$28,000 Budget
by Liz Seley 
Student Congress met Jan­
uary 6 in an extra session to 
discuss the budget for 1965.
This year for the first time the 
Finance Committee of Student 
Congress will submit a budget 
for consideration by the Univer­
sity. The budget calls for over 
$28,000, an increase of $10,000 over last year.
The budget was first submitted 
to congress at the December 16 
meetings. However, congress 
members decided that the budget 
should be discussed further and 
revised.
At last week’s meeting of Stu­
dent Congress, the Finance Com­
mittee presented a revised 
budget for approval by congress 
representatives. Discussion 
resulted in the acceptance of the 
revised budget and the passing 
of amendments to this budget.
The motion proposed by David 
Aronowitz, chairman of the Fi­
nance Committee called for al­
locations of $1,750 to the Debate 
Team, $800 to the Radio Club, 
$1,700 to Cameron Choir, $5,800 
to the Tartan» $1000 to Student 
Congress, $2,150 to WRCT, and 
$3,650 to the Technical.
The amendment asks that al­
locations be approved tentatively 
by Student Congress. The budget 
prepared by the Finance Commit­
tee will be presented to the uni­
versity to give it some idea of 
how funds will later be distrib­
uted.
After the school considers the 
proposed budget of the Finance 
Committee, congress will meet to 
discuss how much each organiza­
tion included in the budget will 
receive.

The juveniles were discovered 
rummaging through an office on 
the evening of December 15.
They were taken into custody 
by the Pittsburgh Youth Squad.
Questioning of the teenagers, 
who are unaffiliated with Carnegie 
Tech, led to the discovery of three 
older members of the gang.
This gang was responsible for 
a series of thefts in Skibo, Doherty 
Hall, and Scaife Hall dating to last 
October. They operated from early 
evening until 9:30 p.m., and bur­
glarized unlocked offices.
The Security Office is working

by Howard Weiss 
Miss Anna L. McCandless is one of the most active mem­
bers of the class of 1919. Today, at the age of 65 she is a 
member of such diverse organizations as the Carnegie In­
stitute Society and the Appalachian Mountain Club.
After graduating from the sec­
retarial department of Marg.ii« I 
Morrison Carnegie College with ; 
bachelors degree, she became sec 
relary to prominent businessman

Water Polo 
Favorites:
The intra-mural water polo 
season got underway before 
Christmas vacation with ATO 
and GSIA the pre-season fav­
orites.
Water polo may best be describ­
ed as competitive drowning, since the players may be subject to 
dunking at any time they have 
possession of the ball, and must 
iry to score - goals and fight to 
stay above water.
The three powers in the league 
at the present time are GSIA, 
Beta Sigma Rho, and Alpha Tau 
Omega. Since the**e is only one 
league, there will be no playoffs, 
and the winner of the league takes 
all.
Both Beta Sig and GSIA sport 
3 and 0 records with both teams 
scheduled to meet this week. If 
the grads win, it will clinch the 
win for them. However, if Beta 
Sig wins and ATO can come back 
and beat Bela Sig, it will mean a 
three way tie for first. So, the 
water polo race is still wide open.
ATO, the water polo champion 
for the past few years, suffered 
iis only defeat last week at the 
hands of the strong GSIA team. 
The ATO defense was at its best, 
and they held GSIA to only two 
goals, but they could not get an 
offense going and scored only one 
point in the hard fought battle 
with the big GSIA team.
So, the two biggest games are 
coming up this week, with Beta 
Sig meeting GSIA and ATO. These 
two games will decide whether 
there will be a clean sweep for 
the Grads or Beta Sig, or whether 
there will be a three way tie for 
first. It should prove an interest­
ing and exciting race for the water 
polo championship with all three 
teams very much in the fight.

The Carnegie Fine Arts 
String Quartet will present 
the second of three Concerts-

Fraternity Life 
Shown In Film
The National Interfraternity 
Conference and the National Panhellenic Council have joint­
ly sponsored a color film on fra­
ternity life.

Tech Receives 
Three Grants
Carnegie Tcch has received 
three grants for research in the 
Departments of Electrical Engi­
neering and Chemistry from the 
National Science Foundation and 
National Institute of Health.
Professor Arthur G. Milnes, 
professor of electrical engineering, 
received an NSF grant of $56,000 
for research in the field of elec­
trical and electro-optical phenom­
ena caused by deep-lying im­
purity levels in semiconductors.
Allah K. Colter, an assistant professor of chemistry, is at work 
in the field of charge-transfer 
complexes, with'an NSF grant of 
$32,400.
Philip L. South wick, professor 
of chemistry, received $30,960 to 
continue his work in the field 
of synthesis of pyrrolidine deri­
vations for NIH. The research 
deals with the search of new 
medicine to relieve pain and treat 
asthma and hay fever.
Rifle Team 
Beats Clarion
Paced by Senior Woody Whit- 
latch, the Carnegie Rifle team 
gained a bit of sweet revenge at 
the expense of Clarion by a score 
of 1391 to 1380. Woody fired a 
fine 99-96-89—284, his best per­
formance of the season. Woody’s 
score would have been a lot bet­
ter had he not dropped two shots 
in the standing position. Woody 
had six tens, two nines, a six 
and a five for his score of 89.
Freshman Ted Mankovich also 
turned in his best score of the 
year, a 99-92-88—279, to finish 
second for the Tartans and sec­
ond in the match. Bob Fritz and 
Rich Damberg turned in a pair 
of 277’s and Leighton Westlake 
fired a 274 to round out Tech's 
evening.
Low man for the evening was 
Scott McCormick who shot an 
ignominious 258, his lowest score 
in two years. The two high men 
for Clairion were Slater and 
Perry, who each finished at 278.
The Tartan shooters can now 
sit back and relax until February 
13, when they travel to Meadville 
to take on Allengheny.
Naming Lauds 
Ex-Presidents
by Gretclien Smith
According to the adminis­
tration, changes in campus 
building names were made to 
commemorate the past presi­
dents of Carnegie Tech, and 
to eliminate confusion be­
tween the old and proposed 
administration halls.
Earlier this semester, Engineer­
ing Hall was renamed Doherty 
Hall; Administration Hall became 
Baker Hall; and Machinery Hall 
was renamed Hamerschlag Hall.
Although dormitories have al­
ready been named after these 
presidents, the administration felt 
it would be more appropriate to 
recognize them on the central 
campus.
A name for the proposed ad­
ministration hall has not yet been 
selected. It is expected by some 
that the name of it will be an­
nounced either next term or be­
fore ground-breaking ceremonies.
Concert Series
The Carnegie Concert Series' 
third and fourth concerts of the 
season will be held on January 27 and February 10.
The January concerts will be 
held in the Fine Rrts Theater at 
8:30 p.m. Guest artists, Daniel 
Majeska, violinist, and Harold 
Fink, pianist, will perform.
The February concert, featuring 
guest artists Charles Gillespie, 
vocalist, and Rudolph Fellner, 
pianist, will be held in the Car­
negie Lecture Hall at 8:30 p.m.
'Orb and Instrument1
An iron construction by Rob­
ert Lepper, professor of painting, 
design and sculpture, has been 
acquired by the Museum of Mod­em Art in New York.
The construction is entitled 
"Orb and Instrument."
Composers' Forum
The Composers’ Forum will pre­
sent the music of Benjamin Lees, 
on February 6, at 3:00 p.m. in the 
Carnegie Music Hall.
Professor N. Laponikoff of the 
Carnegie Tech Music department 
will speak about the composer.

%ch Swims To Third Victory,- 
Set 4 Records At Allegheny
The Carnegie Tech swimming team smashed three school 
records and tied a fourth on their way to their third consecu­
tive win this season, beating Allegheny, 48-46.Bill Cotsworth first tied the 200 
yard freestyle record at 2:05.0á
’nd then went on to shatter the 
00 yd free-style record by almost 
10 seconds with a time of 5:25.5.
Not to be outdone, Pete Hutter 
roared to a first in the 60 yd 
freestyle and later broke the 100 
yd freestyle record by over a 
second with a time of :53.0.
Tech team captain Dave Specht 
bettered his' old record in the 200 
yd breaststroke with an impresive 
time of 2:37.0.The Tartan freeseyle and med­
ley relay teams both registered 
better times than the present 
school records, but Allegheny vic­
tories in the two events kept the 
achievements out of the record 
books.Allegheny held the lead in the 
meet up to the diving. Here Car­
negie Tech took over and by the 
second to last event had enough 
points to clinch the meet.
High scorer for Allegheny was 
^Bill Dewitt, who led their Medley 
‘-«Relay and took-in the 200 yd in­
dividual medley and the 200 yd 
backstroke.
The Tartans travel to W & J 
today with hopes of their first vic­tory there in several years. The 
next home meet is Saturday, Feb­
ruary 6, at 2:00 p.m. in the Car­
negie Tech Pool.
¿SAE Wins 
Volleyball 
Championship
Sigma Alpha Epsilon turned 
on the steam at the outset of the 
l.M. volleyball championship 
game, and by the time the smoke 
cleared on the Grad Nads side 
of the court, SAE was already 
'^through the championship door. 
The Grad Nads failed to score 
a single point in the first game, 
as they spent most of their time 
avoiding the hard driving spikes 
sent at them by two long-estab- 
lished veterans in the volleyball 
wars, Harvey Gammon and John Regan.
With the aid of some perfectly 
executed sets by Willie McClure, 
and some sound defensive play 
«fcby the SAE aggregation as a 
whole, Gammon and Regan had 
a field day scattering the Grad 
Nads around the opposite side of 
the court. Down, but'not out, the 
Nads effectively began to set 
Ralph Kilmoyer in the second 
game, but SAE’s offense held up, 
and resulted in a 15-11 decision 
*:nd the championship.
SAE made a clean sweep of 
the night’s events by defeating BTP in the consolation encounter. 
0 For SAE “B,” the spiking tac­tics of John Mulholland and Doug 
Cranwell proved too much for the 
Beta's to handle, and SAE ‘‘B'J 
won two straight games by scores 
of 15-13 and 15-3.

Paffe 8 ;— CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN — Wednesday» January 13, 1965-
Basketball Team in Slump;
lose Three Of Four Games
by Tom Terpack
Tech’s basketball fortunes continue to sink. lower and 
lower as the season progresses, and, unless a complete re­
versal of form takes place, the Tartans may have their worst
season since 1961-62’s 4-21 year.*---------------------------------------:—r-
1'efore the Christmas break,
Tech dropped a giame to Bald- 
win-Wallace, 94-74, but man­
aged to upend Thiel, 77-63, for 
their second win of the season.
During the past week, howevor, 
the Tartans played two bad 
games, losing to St. Vincent, 70- 
62, and Penn State, 69-36.
Against Baldwin-Wallace, Tech 
played a fine first half, manag­ing to stay ahead of the Yellow- 
Jackets until the final minute, 
when they lost the lead with 
forty-five seconds remaining.Hank Werronen and Jeff Kalin 
kept the Tartans in the game with a good show of shooting, but they 
were m a t c h e d by. the single- 
handed heroics of “Flash” Gor­
don, who had twenty of B-W’s 
forty-two first half points.
With five, four, or three — 
take your pick — minutes left in 
the first half, a bright Fine Arts 
student noticed that Tech’s new 
electronic marvel, the multi-hued 
scoreboard (which most people 
can’t see anyhow), was . doing a 
fine job of ticking off the sec­
onds, but for some reason stayed 
at “5” minutes. The scare at this time was 32-32, but the failure of 
modern engineering so unnerved 
Tech’s equation solvers that B-W 
slipped into a 42-38 half-time 
lead.
The Yellow-Jackets changed 
into »a man-to-man defense in 
the second half» and all but 
stopped Tech cold. Outscoring 
the Tartans 26-13 in the first 
ten minutes, the Jackets quick­
ly upped their, lead to 68-55, 
and coasted to a 94-74 victory.
The following night; bouyed by 
the prospect of an upcoming va­
cation, the Tartans, led by Don 
Keefer, held Thiel even in the 
first half, and then spurted to 
stop the Tomcats, 77-63. Thiel, 
which hasn’t won a game since 
1962, proved a capable foe in the 
first half, but could not match the 
shooting' of Keefer. in the second 
slanza.
Keefer, who scored twenty- 
seven, including 11 of 12 from 
the field, was aided by Jeff 
Kalin, who dropped in twenty 
points and picked off twelve re­
bounds, and at the game's finish, 
the scoreboard (repaired) saw 
Tech the victor, 77-63.
Mel Cratsley’s charges opened 
the 1965 segment of the campaign 
last Wednesday night against St.
Vincent. The visiting Bearcats 
opened a quick 5-0 lead, until 
Hank Werronen dropped in a 
basket for Tech. Seeing that the 
Tartans were getting hot, a St.
Vincent player dropped his con­
tact, necessitating a delay that 
would hopefully cool off the Tar­
tans. Led by Keefer and Kalin, 
however, the Tartans bumbled 
into the lead, and left for the 
locker room at the end of the 
half with a 37-32 advantage.
The second half was another 
story altogether. Playing the most 
inept ball seen in Skibo gym this 
year, the Tartans gave up eight 
straight points and the lead. Man­
aging only five points in the first ten minutes of the second half,
Tech fell behind, 49-42.
Tech began to fight back, an j 
with 1:45 remaining, George 
McGeary plunked in a bunny to j 
bring the Tartans within two I
points, 62-60. However, Tony 
Gentile of St. Vincent, who 
finished the night with 23, coun­
tered with a two-pointer and à 
foul-shot to .insure victory for 
St. Vincent.'The Bearcats finish­
ed with a 70-62 win, with Tech’s 
only ' bright spots being Kalin, 
with 16 points, and the "new 
edition” Don Keefer, with 19. 
Saturday night saw Tech make 
its bi-annual pilgrimage to Penn 
State, to help dedicate the new 
Nittany Lion fieldhouse. Preceded 
by a gymnastics meet and a wrest­
ling match (the major winter- 
sports at Penn State), the game 
finally began at 10 p.m. with 7000 
exuberant fans in attendance.
The final, outcome became 
quickly apparent, and the only 
question was the final score. The 
Lions moved into a quick lead, and 
Tech, playing a pre-planned con­
trol-game fell behind 11-2 in the 
first seven minutes.
State fans caught on ¦'immedi­
ately to Tech’s stalling operation, 
and began to count the number of 
passes each time Tech had the 
ball. Obviously already tense be­
fore the huge crowd, the Tartans 
became highly disconcerted by the 
fans’ chanting. After passing the 
ball twenty or twenty-five times, 
Tech would give the ball away by 
committing basic errors, such as 
travelling or standing out 
bounds. The first half ended with 
Tech behind, 34-19, having given 
up the ball fourteen times on turn­
overs.
Like the little girl with the 
curl, when Tech is bad, they’re 
horrid. Scoring at will, State 
moved into a commanding 53- 
22 lead, giving Tech only five 
field goal attempts (one success­
ful- in the first eight minutes. 
The entrance of the second and 
third teams did little to relieve 
the Tartans’ misery, .and the 
Lions walked away with a 69- 
36 victory.
The Tartans have looked fan­
tastically atrocious in the last two 
games. Basically a good ball club, 
as was shown earlier in the year 
against Westminster, the team has 
had trouble working together 
since. Other problems, such as a 
lack of rebounding and the slump 
of Hank Werronen, have added to 
to Tech’s woe.
Don Keefer’s hustling and 
shooting have been carrying the 
team for the past three games. 
Keefer, who has developed into a 
fine ball-player, has picked up 27, 
19, and 16 points in the last three 
games for 65 points, and has made 
27 of 40 from the field for 68%.
The Tartans will lay off for two 
weeks, due to finals, but will be 
back in action in two away games, 
with Westminster on January 30, 
and Allegheny on February 3.
IM Bowling 
Nears Finale
With only one week re­
maining in-- regular season 
play, there are still many 
playoff sports being fought 
over. The favorites at this 
stage seems to be Beta Theta 
“A” in the Strikes League 
and GSIA “B” in the Spares 
League. These two teams 
seem destined to meet in the 
finals.
Action last week found BTP 
“A” taking 3 from DU, TDP “A” 
taking 3 from the Dorm Rats, and 
Whales “A” sweeping Malt & 
Ryes 4-0. February 6 will find 
TDP “A” tangling with BTP “A” 
and if Tau Delt can pull an upset 
over the Beta’s they can vault 
into first place.
In the Spares League, GSIA “B1 
has first place sown up, and it 
seems that ATO “A” will take 
second place as the third place 
Delts will tangle with GSIA “B" 
and stand to lose all 4. Last week’s 
action found GSIA “B” taking 4 
from the Whales “B”, DTD taking 
4 from BTP “B”, and ATO “A” 
coming out on top of BSR 3-1.
The Splits League showed GSIA “G” winning 3-1 over SN, SAE 
over B-300 3-1, and Scobowls 
besting TDP “B” 3-1. The top 
positions should go to GSIA “G”, 
SAE or Scobowls.
The other two playoff position 
go to the two top averages and 
these places should fall to DTD 
J and BSR. If the Scobowls manage 
1 to best SAE for second in the 
Splits League, then SAE will claim 
the second high average position.
