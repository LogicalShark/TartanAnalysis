President Farnam Jahanian 
used his Oct. 26 inaugura-
tion address to announce that 
“the Allegheny Foundation has 
committed a $30 million lead 
grant toward the transformation 
of Scaife Hall into a modern, 
new home for Mechanical 
Engineering.” 
The transformation will mark 
the seventh signi?cant change 
to the infamously-latticed 1962 
engineering building. This time 
it will be a complete rebuild, 
with an emphasis on modern 
labs, recon?gurable classrooms, 
and collaborative spaces, and 
probably a goodbye to the Pringle-
shaped lecture hall in the front. 
The large grant came from 
the Allegheny Foundation, a 
subsidiary of Scaife Foundations, 
another namesake of Alan M. 
Scaife. According to their web-
site, the Allegheny Foundation 
“con?nes most of its grant awards 
to programs for historic preser-
vation, civic development and 
education.” The grant for the new 
Scaife Hall is the largest grant 
ever offered by the foundation.
Past grants of the Allegheny 
Foundation mostly include lo-
cal educational and community-
oriented donations. Outside of 
the community, the foundation 
mostly donates to conserva-
tive groups such as the Heritage 
Foundation, the CATO Institute, 
and the American Legislative 
Exchange Council.
President Jahanian noted in 
his inaugural address that the 
grant from the Allegheny Founda-
tion pushed the “total infrastruc-
ture investments in engineering 
over the past decade to more than 
a quarter billion dollars.”
The Tartan interviewed Allen 
L. Robinson, Engineering and 
Public Policy Department Head 
and Raymond J. Lane Distin-
guished Professor in Mechanical 
Engineering, who shed some light 
on the potential impact of a new 
Scaife Hall from the perspective 
of the Department of Mechanical 
Engineering.
Currently, Robinson says, 
Scaife Hall and Mechanical Engi-
neering spaces are “lacking in sev-
eral dimensions.” With the move 
towards more project-focused 
and ?ipped-classroom courses 
in the College of Engineering, 
traditional classroom spaces are 
not optimal, Robinson said. He 
continued, “New Scaife will have 
those sorts of ?exible classrooms. 
This will bene?t MechE, other en-
gineering departments, and [the] 
university as a whole.”
Robinson also notes that “the 
number of MechE students has 
more than doubled since I joined 
the faculty about 20 years ago,” 
with large growth in undergradu-
ate, graduate, and faculty popu-
lations, though the spaces the 
Mechanical Engineering program 
occupies on campus have largely 
remained the same.
With the increase in multi-dis-
ciplinary research taking place in 
the College of Engineering, cur-
rent lab spaces that favor small 
research teams are outdated 
and lacking, Robinson told The 
Tartan. New lab spaces will 
encourage collaboration among 
students and faculty alike, and 
will be able to accommodate new 
research on “novel technologies 
such as DNA-origami, biohybrid 
robotics, and biomechanics,” 
Robinson says, continuing, “these 
types of research require different 
types of infrastructure that don’t 
exist in Scaife.”
Ultimately, Robinson says 
that a new Scaife Hall “will 
dramatically enhance our gradu-
ate and undergraduate education 
programs. It will also accelerate 
our research activities by promot-
ing highly collaborative research 
in critical emerging areas.”
President Jahanian aired 
similar sentiments in his inaugural 
address, saying that due to this 
expansion, Carnegie Mellon 
University “will be better able to 
compete for the best students and 
faculty, driving Pittsburgh’s repu-
tation as a hub for innovation.”
With this new Scaife Hall, 
as well as the new Tepper 
Quadrangle, the forthcoming 
ANSYS Hall, and the recently 
purchased Shadyside apart-
ment building, Carnegie Mellon 
University is furthering its in-
frastructure expansion plans in 
Pittsburgh.
Construction is yet to begin, 
but the new building is expected 
to be double the size of the current 
Scaife Hall in the same location. 
There is no scheduled completion 
date as of now, but construction 
will probably push students out of 
Scaife sometime soon.

On Nov. 2, Carnegie Mellon 
purchased a Shadyside apart-
ment complex known as Fifth 
Neville for $16.98 million, 
one of its most expensive real 
estate investments to date.
According to Allegheny 
county real estate records, the 
Fifth Neville complex had been 
assessed at $3.6 million, which 
means that Carnegie Mellon 
paid more than $13 million 
over the assessed price for Fifth 
Neville, more than $217,000 
per unit. This far exceeds the 
price per unit paid for the 
319-apartment Ascent 430, a 
luxury apartment in Warrenda-
le with a number of amenities 
such as a swimming pool, con-
ference rooms, and even more. 
While some may question why 
Carnegie Mellon would pay so 
much more than the county’s 
assessment for the Fifth Neville 
apartment complex, university 
spokespeople and outside busi-
ness professionals think that 
this is an excellent purchase.
The Fifth Neville apartment 
complex is located at 4705 
Fifth Avenue, quite close to 
the corner of Neville Street. 
Carnegie Mellon spokesman 
Jason Maderer said in a state-
ment to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette that the benefits of the 
investment are twofold: it will 
allow Carnegie Mellon to both 
satisfy the increasing demand 
for university-owned hous-
ing, and also allow Carnegie 
Mellon to be more flexible in 
initiating future renovations 
to existing buildings. Carnegie 
Mellon plans to renovate Fifth 
Neville to elevate the complex 
to university standards in mat-
ters such as life safety.
The managing director 
of Colliers International’s 
Pittsburgh office, Gregg 
Broujos, acknowledged that 
Carnegie Mellon paid a great 
deal for Fifth Neville when he 
spoke to the Pittsburgh Business 
Times. Regardless, he stated 
that “Oakland has and will 
continue to demand the high-
est prices, quite frankly, in the 
state.” As the healthcare and 
scholarly center of Pittsburgh 
and one of a number of the 
city’s most popular cultural 
centers, Broujos and others see 
the cost as fully justified due 
to the ever-increasing demand 
for properties in a coveted 
area stuffed to the brim with 
activity.
Although Fifth Neville was 
constructed 60 years ago, the 
six story high, 78-unit apart-
ment complex has recently 
been updated to modern stan-
dards. In addition, it is at a 
nearly full capacity. Most of 
the 78 units are single or dou-
ble occupancy. The university 
has stated that Fifth Neville’s 
location is ideal for Carnegie 
Mellon students.
Fifth Neville is near other 
Carnegie Mellon-owned 
housing complexes on Fifth 
Avenue, including several re-
cently bought from the Roman 
Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, 
which will make it relatively 
simple for Carnegie Mellon to 
incorporate it into its “institu-
tional master plan.” Moreover, 
it’s only a short walk from 
Fifth Neville to the Tepper 
Quadrangle and, in turn, 
to Carnegie Mellon’s main 
campus.
In 2015, Carnegie Mellon 
requested that the zoning for 
a parcel of land it bought from 
the diocese be changed to 
EMI, or Educational, Medical, 
and Institutional. Although 
Carnegie Mellon planned 
on constructing a five-story 
building to serve as a “hub of 
student life” to be completed by 
the spring of 2018, that plan is 
still on hold for the time being. 
That building would have 
been Carnegie Mellon’s first 
academic facility in Shadyside.

By now it’s no secret: at least 
19 percent of students at Carnegie 
Mellon are living with food in-
security. The 2017 Campus Cup-
board study on food insecurity 
at 11 colleges in the Pittsburgh 
area showed that for nearly 2,700 
students at this school, access to 
food is a problem. Since last fall, 
students and university adminis-
tration have been working hard to 
change that. On Friday afternoon, 
the fruits of their labor were cel-
ebrated at the brand-new CMU 
Pantry open house.
Located on the ?rst ?oor of 
the Residence on Fifth housing 
community, the CMU Pantry aims 
to reduce student hunger by giv-
ing students access to free non-
perishables and produce, as well 
as other basic needs items. Any 
Carnegie Mellon student can shop 
at the CMU Pantry after ?lling out 
the registration forms, and can 
return on a biweekly basis.
The Pantry is run by a mix of 
volunteers and paid staff, who as-
sist new and returning shoppers 
with ?nding items, developing 
shopping lists, and meal plan-
ning. The small space consists of 
a checkout table with shopping 
guidelines, a walk-in refrigerator 
for fresh produce and dairy prod-
ucts, and a shelf section. On the 
shelves are condiments, a wide 
array of canned goods, grains, 
baking supplies, snack foods, and 
personal hygiene products.
About 60 people from the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
attended the open house, receiving 
?iers on topics like “Eating better 
on a budget” and “Smart snack-
ing.” Pantry staff led visitors on 
tours of the small space, showing 
a sample shopping bag of items: a 
bag of rice, a carton of milk, a tube 
of toothpaste, a box of cereal, and 
multiple cans of beans, peas, and 
other vegetables.
Also in the Pantry is the 
“expired” shelf, which includes 
items ranging from Cliff bars to 
Matzoh to tortillas which have 
passed their “best by” date. Pantry 
Coordinator William Coggins ex-
plained that the “best by” date 
on most foods is somewhat arbi-
trary: “This food will still be good 
for a while, with no change in 
taste or nutritional value.” Items 
on the expired shelf, along with 
fresh produce from the walk-in 
refrigerator, have no limit on 
consumption: students can take as 
many as they need.
Along with access to food, said 
Coggins, a ?rst-year graduate stu-
dent in Heinz College, education is 
a major priority at the Pantry. “We 
realize that a big barrier to healthy 
eating could be not knowing what 
to do with food,” he said, gestur-
ing towards a stack of recipe cards 
stacked on a shelf.
Of the numerous speakers at 
the open house, the only non-
Carnegie Mellon af?liate was 
Charlese McKinney, the Network 
Development Director for the 
Greater Pittsburgh Community 
Food Bank (GPCFB). She spoke 
highly of Carnegie Mellon’s quick 
response to the study and of the im-
portance of institutional partner-
ships: “Our traditional networks 
work with thousands of people in 
the Pittsburgh area,” she said to 
the room, “but there are thousands 
more we aren’t reaching. Campus 
Cupboards help us reach young 
bright minds who are struggling 
with food insecurity.”
The CMU Pantry is now a part 
of the GPCFB network, and will 
receive a majority of its staple 
items from the larger organiza-
tion. GPCFB will also provide free 
produce donated by local farms. 
Other sourcing will come from 
campus food drives, community 
organizations such as 412 Food 
Rescue, and purchasing via the 
Pantry’s Division of Student Affairs 
(DOSA) budget.
“There’s also the potential to go 
out and buy directly from grocery 
stores,” said Stephanie Laughton, 
Vice President of Campus Affairs 
for the Graduate Student Assem-
bly (GSA), “particularly keeping 
an eye on the fact that our stu-
dent population is very interna-
tional and may not want a mostly 
American selection.” Laughton, a 
fourth-year PhD student in Civil 
and Environmental Engineering, 
played a key administrative role

Though Scaife Hall is hidden from the main campus it has many features that distinguish it, including its unusual enterence.
At the grand opening of the Pantry, attendees celebrated both the work that went into its creation and the work still to come.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT COLUMN
RUBEN SRISKANDA
Special to The Tartan
Over the last few weeks, 
the Student Senate has been 
working tirelessly to serve the 
undergraduate population. 
From Oct. 21 to Oct. 26, the 
Senate hosted a whole week 
of engagement. During Sen-
ate Week, the Undergraduate 
Senate informed and offered 
many activities for the students, 
including the Strip Crawl, an 
event called “Key to my Suc-
cess,” a Q and A session about 
any comments or concerns re-
garding Housing Services and 
Facilities Management Services, 
and an information session to 
assist organizations on applying 
for funding resources and 
special allocations. The week 
was a valuable experience for 
Carnegie Mellon students to see 
how the Senate is continuously 
representing the undergradu-
ates, reflecting the theme of 
representation.
Within the last two weeks, 
the Senate has been deeply in-
volved in the discussion of the 
Housing Master Plan. Commu-
nicating with representatives, 
the Undergraduate Senate is 
playing a critical role in the con-
sultation and advisement of new 
study spaces, students centers, 
fitness centers, computer clus-
ters, and other resources that 
will benefit the undergraduate 
population.
Finally, the Senate has 
continued its role of pro-
viding mid-year funding to 
clubs and organizations that 
recently formed or have re-
cently acquired unexpected 
costs. This happened to several 
organizations, including the 
Chess Club and the Spanish and 
Latin Student Association. De-
termined to support programs 
and offer benefits to the Under-
graduate population, the Senate 
continues to review finance re-
quests to support student orga-
nizations. The Undergraduate 
Student Senate is continuing to 
tackle new problems, develop 
new events and opportunities, 
and advocate on behalf of the 
student population.

Some around Pittsburgh might ?nd it hard to communicate to 
people outside the city just how it feels to have been so close to such 
an incomprehensible tragedy as the one that took place at the Tree of 
Life synagogue. This past Saturday, those that entered Commonplace 
Coffee were reminded that Pittsburgh is sadly not alone in this 
experience.
A group of alums from Frasier Woods, a school in Newtown, CT, 
donated $650 so that patrons of Commonplace Coffee, a coffee 
shop in Squirrel Hill, could enjoy a free beverage. Those that are a 
part of the Newtown community understand what it is like when 
a national tragedy happens in your neighborhood. The gift was 
organized by a Frasier Woods mother, Kathy Craughwell-Varda, 
who told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that while she knew the 
coffee would not ?x everything, the acts of kindness that her 
community received following the attacks on the Sandy 
Hook Elementary School helped residents cope.
A post on Commonplace Coffee’s Instagram page 
explained, “They understand that it affects all of us, and 
that as individuals and communities, we need to make 
sure we’re taking care of ourselves. Join us today 
for some coffee and healing, and also in thanking 
this incredibly kind group of people.”
Students frequently patronize and 
work at Commonplace Coffee, which 
some would argue is one of the best of 
the coffee shops close to Carnegie 
Mellon. One such student was Mason Young-Shor, a junior majoring 
in Design who happened to be meeting a friend for a cup of coffee 
on Saturday. As he was waiting online to make his usual order, a 
medium black coffee, he noticed the barista did not accept payment 
from the people ahead of him, explaining that the donation from 
Newtown families covered the expense of their coffee.
Young-Shor found himself “grateful, not so much for the $2 
but for making me feel a part of the community.” He has lived 
in Squirrel Hill for two years, but tended to think of himself as 
primarily a member of the Carnegie Mellon community. This 
donation made him “[look] back at all the times [he] had 
been able to engage with strangers through the comfort and 
community [that] Commonplace and Squirrel Hill offer” 
and “place value in those connections.”
The gift offered at Commonplace that day, from 
Newtown residents to Squirrel Hill residents, was not 
just one of coffee. “The gift that Newtown families 
gave me and I hope all the others who were fortunate 
enough to sit down in Commonplace that day, who 
read this article, and members of the Squirrel Hill 
or any similar effected community, was a sense 
of being, being part, being supported, and 
being loved, and I am grateful for that,” 
Young-Shor said. As Craughwell-Varda 
said to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
this gift was meant to “just let them 
know we are thinking about 
them, and that they are not 
alone.”
Newtown families donate coffee to comfort Squirrel Hill
councilwoman for Shadyside 
and parts of Oakland, has 
met with Carnegie Mellon 
leaders to discuss the Fifth 
Neville purchase, but she has 
yet to hear of any concrete 
plans. “[I look forward to] a 
full community process once 
plans are developed,” said 
Strassburger to the Pittsburgh 
Business Times.
Carnegie Mellon’s purchase 
of Fifth Neville marks its latest 
expansion beyond the bound-
aries of the main campus and 
into the largely residential 
Shadyside. Fifth Neville itself 
was a commercial residential 
apartment complex itself pri-
or to Carnegie Mellon’s pur-
chase of it. Current residents 
of Fifth Neville will be forced 
to leave the complex upon the 
completion of their respective 
leases.
In a broader sense, Carnegie 
Mellon’s purchase of Fifth 
Neville is representative of its 
increasing focus on expand-
ing the university, both in 
terms of campus housing and 
academic buildings. One need 
only look at Carnegie Mellon’s 
plans for the brand new Scaife 
Hall, the constant construction 
on many parts of campus such 
as the Mall, and the recently 
completed Tepper Quadrangle 
to understand Carnegie 
Mellon’s plans for its future.
in the transition from proposal to 
reality this fall.
The initial push for the project 
came mostly from within the 
graduate student community. In 
what could only be described as 
perfect timing, second-year Heinz 
student Sarah Pesi began gradu-
ate school just before the results 
of the Campus Cupboard survey 
were released. “On the ?rst day 
of graduate student orientation, 
I found myself in a conversation 
with Gina Casalegno about the 
study,” she recalled. Pesi spent the 
previous year managing the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh food pantry 
as an AmeriCorps VISTA volun-
teer, and has struggled with food 
insecurity in the past.
She founded the Graduate 
Student Assembly Basic Needs 
working group last fall to bet-
ter understand the speci?c 
issues contributing to the prob-
lem, which eventually led to the 
creation of the Campus Food 
Insecurity Committee. This 
committee, consisting of staff 
and students from both under-
graduate and graduate programs, 
worked with SLICE, Dining 
Services, Pitt, and the GPCFB to 
make the Pantry a reality.
Pesi, who has since stepped 
back from leading this effort to 
focus on school, spoke highly of 
the committee members. “We 
would spend hours on things,” 
she reminisced about the spring of 
2018, when a core group of about 
six graduate and undergraduate 
students plugged away at the thir-
ty-page comprehensive proposal 
document. “Our team was small 
but mighty,” she said with a smile.
In her closing remarks Friday 
afternoon, Vice President 
for Student Affairs and Dean 
of Students Gina Casalegno 
expressed admiration for the ef-
forts of the students and staff who 
made the CMU Pantry a reality, 
and looked to the future. “This 
issue is personal,” she said, “But 
I’m thrilled to say this is just the 
beginning. It doesn’t stop here.”
The CMU Pantry is free to all 
students and is located on the ?rst 
?oor of the Residence on Fifth 
(4700 Fifth Avenue). To donate 
shopping bags or inquire about 
volunteering, email the Pantry 
Coordinator at cmu-pantry@

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
Re?ections post-2018 midterm election: how hard did the anticipated Blue Wave hit?
The 2018 midterm was argued 
to be one of the most signi?cant 
midterm elections in recent U.S. 
history. As reported last week 
by The Tartan’s Editorial Board, 
many of the House seats were 
“up for grabs, while 35 out of the 
100 Senate seats [were] up for 
reelection.” Before the poll results 
were released, FiveThirtyEight 
forecasted a “7 in 8 chance 
Democrats win [House] control,” 
solidifying the prediction of an 
upcoming “blue wave.”
With a nod to last week’s 
piece from The Tartan Editorial 
Board, all three of the endorsed 
candidates — Tom Wolf, Bob 
Casey Jr., and Dan Frankel — were 
elected as Governor, Senator, and 
State Representative, respectively. 
Although Pennsylvania’s 
gerrymandering had allowed 
a disproportionate number of 
Republicans to represent the 
state, with the recently redrawn 
legislative maps, Pennsylvanians 
got the chance to choose leaders 
more accurately representing 
them and their political beliefs in 
the 2018 midterms.
The extent to which the blue 
wave hit is arguable. Although 
the Senate maintains its 
Republican majority, we saw a 
massive increase in the number 
of minorities representing the 
diverse American population. 107 
women were elected to the House 
this time around, two of whom 
are Muslim. Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez set a new precedent for 
young citizens wishing to enter 
the political arena by becoming 
the youngest congresswoman at 
age 29. Despite these historical 
milestones, there are still ballot 
recounts and signs of voter 
suppression worth investigating.
In the Texas Senate race, 
Republican Ted Cruz narrowly 
beat Democratic candidate Beto 
O’Rourke by 2.6 percentage 
points. Texas elections carried 
problems due to faulty and 
outdated voting machines as well 
as crowded polling stations. Some 
voters caught on to the errors and 
manually changed their ballots to 
re?ect their choice in candidates, 
but it is unknown how many 
ballots were affected. Texas, in 
response, blamed user error, not 
the faulty and outdated machines.
Texas is not the only state 
impacted by machine-induced 
errors; they may have contributed 
to voter suppression in Georgia 
as well. Republican Brian Kemp 
was up 1.6 percentage points 
over Democrat opponent Stacey 
Abrams, but multiple voters were 
turned away, had their absentee 
ballots rejected, or could not have 
their voting registration veri?ed. 
Despite the close ballot count, it 
is unlikely that a ballot recount 
would swing towards Abrams’ 
favor, but voter suppression 
on even a small scale can set 
a dangerous precedent to the 
erosion of democracy.
In Florida, Broward County 
experienced a statistically 
signi?cant undervote rate. While 
all other counties in Florida saw no 
more than a 0.8 percent difference 
in the number of votes cast for 
governor and the U.S. Senate, 
Broward County experienced a 
3.7 percent difference. Multiple 
factors — including poor ballot 
design and, again, faulty ballot 
machines — could have played a 
role in this discrepancy. In Florida’s 
Senate election, Republican Rick 
Scott beat Democrat Bill Nelson 
by a mere 0.18 percentage points. 
Given this tight margin, Florida is 
facing a statewide recount.
Of course, the topic of 
gerrymandering pops up again. 
Pennsylvania was previously 
reported as one of the most 
gerrymandered states, but in 2018, 
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court 
deemed the gerrymandered map 
unconstitutional. Consequently, 
this election saw results which 
were much more representative 
of the popular vote. In 2016, PA 
Democrats won 48 percent of the 
statewide votes in contested House 
elections but only won 27 percent 
of the seats; in 2018, Democrats 
earned 53 percent of the popular 
vote in PA while earning just 
under 50 percent of the contested 
seats. In the meantime, North 
Carolina — another historically 
gerrymandered state — saw 50.3 
percent of the votes going towards 
Republicans, yet Republicans 
took 10 of 13 possible seats. This 
difference between the number of 
votes and the number of seats taken 
echoes that of the 2016 election, 
which is no surprise considering 
North Carolina still has the same 
gerrymandered districts that they 
had in 2016. Other states — such 
as Wisconsin and Michigan — 
were also negatively impacted by 
gerrymandering.
Voter suppression also 
in?uenced the midterm results. 
North Dakota came under ?re 
for not allowing P.O. boxes to be 
used as addresses for voter IDs, 
disproportionately affecting the 
Native American population, 
who almost exclusively use 
P.O. boxes for home addresses. 
Additionally, Georgia’s “exact 
match” law barred many voters 
from participating in the election 
due to discrepancies between 
what is written on a registration 
form and what is present in state 
records. Although these are the 
two major examples that caught 
headlines, some other states 
such as Maryland, Arkansas, and 
Missouri have seen an increase in 
regulations for voter IDs required 
to vote.
For a country that prides 
itself on having free and fair 
elections, there seem to be quite 
a few examples contradicting 
that image. Although the end 
results of the midterm election are 
unlikely to change drastically after 
recounts, steps to ensure a more 
representative House and Senate 
must be taken. With the 2020 
election on the horizon, these 
seemingly minor obstacles may 
add up to affect who is elected as 
Leader of the Free World.

Kanye’s political career: Thank you Kanye, very cool!
FRANK HU
Assissant Forum Editor
It seems that the almighty 
Yeezus has had another 
revelation.
On Oct. 30, Kanye West took 
to Twitter, tweeting that “My 
eyes are now wide open and now 
realize I’ve been used to spread 
messages I don’t believe in. I am 
distancing myself from politics 
and completely focusing on being 
creative !!!”
It’s not clear what caused this 
change of heart, but it’s likely 
that this tweet came in response 
to West’s controversial meeting 
with President Trump on Oct. 11. 
During their exchange, Trump 
sat quietly while West, who was 
wearing a red “Make America 
Great Again” hat, unloaded a 
stream of consciousness rant that 
covered topics as diverse as North 
Korean nuclear disarmament 
and mental illness, all in his 
characteristically bombastic 
style. West concluded their 
meeting by embracing Trump, 
and openly claiming that he 
loved the president.
West’s performance drew 
sharp criticism, with many 
pointing out that the hip-hop 
artist’s friendly relationship 
with the president makes it 
seem like he supports the hateful 
ideologies and downright bigotry 
championed by Trump and his 
base. Clearly, these comments 
were not ignored.
West has a reputation for 
being a defender of controversial 
people, and much like everything 
else, he does it in his own way. 
This generally entails unleashing 
an un?ltered torrent of thought 
at the most inopportune time 
(such as his rant telling everyone 
to leave Elon Musk alone). 
Speaking without thinking is bad 
enough when you’re an ordinary 
person, but when you’re as big 
as Kanye West, your words have 
weight, and you need to choose 
them carefully.
It’s good that West ?nally 
recognized this problem and 
has chosen forego politics to 
focus on his work, for which he 
is in?nitely more quali?ed. But 
the scenario with West is just 
a reminder that celebrities are 
getting increasingly involved in 
our national conversation.
On the one hand, there’s 
nothing wrong with celebrities 
supporting causes or messages 
that they believe in. For example, 
Pharrell Williams sent a cease 
and desist order to Trump when 
he used the song “Happy” at his 
Illinois rally on Oct. 27, the same 
day as the Tree of Life synagogue 
shooting. It’s clear that Pharrell 
does not support Trump, and it’s 
his prerogative how his music is 
used and in what context. Other 
artists, including Rihanna, have 
made similar requests.
In a more proactive sense, big 
stars like Oprah Winfrey and Will 
Ferrell have taken to campaigning 
for the candidates of their choice, 
both going to Georgia to support 
Stacey Abrams in her close race 
for governor against Brian Kemp.
Endorsing anyone as a 
celebrity is risky, and if not 
handled properly, it could 
lead to consequences. This 
was evident when Taylor Swift 
endorsed Tennessee candidates 
Phil Bredesen and Jim Cooper 
in, where she did so through 
the medium of Instagram (of 
all things) by posting a lengthy, 
poorly phrased justi?cation that 
not only missed the mark but also 
promoted divisiveness in politics.
Politics is a sensitive thing for 
anyone to talk about, especially 
big industry stars who have far 
more clout than the ordinary 
person. It’s important for 
celebrities to realize that, should 
they choose to leverage their 
fame and power in favor of some 
individual or cause, they must 
do so in a measured, respectful, 
and targeted way. Otherwise, 
they are only stirring the pot 
with controversial comments and 
endorsements and creating more 
problems, rather than solving 
them.
If that sounds like too dif?cult 
a task, then it’s worthwhile to 
consider stepping out of politics 
for a little while. It’s better late 
than never, and, as West showed 
us, if you want to stop digging a 
deeper hole, step one is to put the 
shovel down.

Last week’s midterm elections 
showed us what can happen when 
people bother to vote. Control of 
the House of Representatives will 
change hands in January, and 
many races that are normally 
written off as safe for one party 
ended up either very close or 
delivering upsets. One-party rule 
of the federal government will 
come to end. These are things 
to celebrate, and they hopefully 
point to a general reawakening 
of American civic engagement. 
But amidst the good news 
of a potentially recovering 
democracy, the midterms showed 
us there’s still a lot of work to do 
to achieve a truly fair electoral 
system.
We knew well before the 
elections took place that there are 
plenty of people in this country 
who want to preserve the legacy 
of segregation by keeping people 
away from voting, and who find it 
defensible to use their positions 
of power to keep themselves and 
their acolytes in high position. 
The big story two weeks ago 
was in Georgia, where the 
candidate and election-overseer 
Brian Kemp was shown to have 
deleted hundreds of 
thousands of voters from 
the registration 
polls, while 
withholding tens 
of thousands more 
absentee ballot and 
voter registration 
applications. The 
majority of these 
applications belonged 
to African-American 
citizens. But that’s 
last week’s news, and 
Kemp wasn’t done 
suppressing the vote 
then.
Despite Kemp's claims 
that everything went 
smoothly in Georgia 
on Election Day, people 
reported hours-long lines 
to vote at some polling 
places, especially in the 
traditionally democratic 
Atlanta area. Voters in 
Gwinnett County, expected 
to be a highly competitive 
district, ended up waiting 
hours to vote, because the 
voting machines at Annistown 
Elementary School were 
delivered to the site without 
power cords. We can’t even 
walk outdoors without a 
tangle of power cords to keep 
our various devices working 
properly, and a state government 
can’t remember that electronic 
machines need a power source? 
Considering, again, that one of 
the candidates in this election was 
the person in charge of Georgia’s 
elections, it seems less like a 
genuine mistake and more of an 
accidental-but-on-purpose way 
of making sure that Kemp came 
out on top. Court orders, spurred 
on by lawsuits from groups like 
the Georgia National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored 
People (NAACP), forced the state 
to keep some polling sites open 
later than normal to account 
for the earlier delays — but the 
damage could have already been 
done. We don’t know how many 
people were forced to leave 
rather than wait at polling sites, 
and we don’t know what other 
forms of suppression might be 
lurking under these more obvious 
displays.
If there is a silver lining to the 
cloud of suppression, it’s that we 
don’t know for sure that it will 
actually end up working in favor 
of those who tried to cheat. As 
of Saturday, the gubernatorial 
election in Georgia has still not 
been called by the Associated 
Press, as the state works its way 
through absentee and provisional 
ballots. The two candidates are 
separated by less than 2 percent, 
and there is a possibility that, 
although Kemp has the small 
lead, the two candidates will 
have to face each other again 
in a December runoff election. 
But the critical thing about this 
election is the numbers. The goal 
of suppression is to disadvantage 
your opponent, and to that end, 
Kemp failed. Even after purging 
people from the voter rolls and 
making it as difficult as possible 
for people to actually cast ballots, 
he ended up in a race that is, 
for him, uncomfortably close. 
There’s a lesson to be learned 
here: we can overcome the cheat-
to-win policies of American 
conservatives if we actually 
show up in large numbers. We 
very nearly did it in Georgia. 
There are also recounts currently 
taking place, for two races in 
Florida, where ballots seemed to 
have gotten mixed up.
Republicans in this country 
are on notice. In terms of policy, 
they know that they have a 
relatively narrow (and shrinking) 
group of core supporters. And 
to be guaranteed victory in 
competitive races, they have 
stopped playing by the rules that 
they claim to hold so dear. The 
biggest takeaway from Tuesday’s 
elections should be this: it is 
unquestionably discouraging 
to hear these stories of voter 
suppression. After all, why even 
bother voting if there’s a chance 
that those in power will not only 
ignore but invalidate the message 
that voters have for them? If 
last week’s elections in states 
like Georgia (and Florida, and 
Arizona) show us anything, it’s 
that the days of the cheat-to-win 
tactic working are numbered. 
When people vote, we overcome 
the cheating strategies of people 
trying to ignore progress and 
keep the country in the past.

The Carnegie Mellon fence 
became the symbol of a grave 
on the night of the Oct. 29. 
Students painted the fence 
black, with two white Stars of 
David sketched on the vertical 
pillars. And then the students 
invited the campus community 
to engage in the Jewish ritual 
of placing a small rock on the 
fence as testimony that the grave 
was visited and the individual’s 
passing mourned. This is just one 
example of the host of actions 
taken by the Carnegie Mellon 
students in response to the 
horrifying tragedy at the Tree 
of Life synagogue last week on 
Saturday, Oct. 27. While there 
are far too many instances to 
enumerate individually and I 
provide examples of a few below, 
the massive show of support that 
I have received from Carnegie 
Mellon students (and the 
broader campus community) has 
made the grief somewhat more 
manageable.
I teach on Mondays and 
Wednesdays and came to class 
on the Monday following the 
shooting, prepared to teach. As 
the class time drew near and I 
took my position at the front of 
the room, it became clear that 
I was unable to focus on the 
material and unable to stand up 
and lecture. I simply sat down at 
the table with the students and 
opened a conversation about the 
events of the previous weekend. I 
told the students that I had been 
attending services in my own 
synagogue (not Tree of Life) on 
Saturday morning, that we had 
been in lockdown, that parents 
had huddled with their children 
and that we had not known 
whether the shooter was headed 
in our direction after Tree of Life. 
I also told them that I am proud 
to be Jewish but now a little more 
frightened to be a member of this 
minority group. I then invited 
students to ask me questions. I 
only managed to remain in the 
classroom for 15 minutes before 
stating that I could not continue 
and, instead, invited the students 
to come talk to me in my office 
if they wished. It only took a 
couple of minutes before a line 
of students, neatly arranged 
in single file in the corridor of 
Baker Hall, appeared outside 
my door. Students entered 
individually or in pairs, hugged 
me, and expressed their outrage 
and their condolences. Many 
students had already emailed 
me over the preceding weekend 
expressing concern about the 
safety of my family and offering 
to provide assistance for my 
affected community.
One such email received just 
after noon on Saturday the 27th 
reads “I unfortunately lived 
through this numerous times 
in my home country (name 
deleted), so I know how anything 
I can say will not help when 
these things happen in your 
community.... Please let me know 
though if there is absolutely 
any way I can help anyone you 
know (or don’t know), blood, 
transportation, etc. anything I 
can do. My number is 412-xx)”.
And I am grateful to so many 
other students on campus. There 
was the extraordinary effort 
and commitment of a group of 
grieving students who partnered 
with the university to plan and 
then host Monday’s gathering in 
Rangos, and the Carnegie Mellon 
students — Jewish and not Jewish 
— who flocked to this service 
in Rangos on Monday evening, 
requiring a second overflow 
location in the Cohon Center. 
And the students whom I have 
only encountered occasionally 
on campus but who still left notes 
under my office door expressing 
their sympathy. And the 
members of the Alpha Epsilon 
Phi fraternity who donated all 
the food originally intended for 
their 412FoodRescue fundraiser 
so that it could be shared by 
students looking for refuge and 
togetherness at the Center for 
Student Diversity and Inclusion 
on Saturday night.
And this email: “Good evening 
Dr. Behrmann. First, I want to say 
that you and your family have 
my greatest condolences after 
the events that transpired this 
weekend. Although the lives of 
so many people have been cut 
short or immensely saddened, 
I am relieved that you are okay. 
As an African-American, I tend 
to lose sight of the hate that so 
many other minorities face in 
this country, so if it offers any 
kind of emotional support, I want 
you and your family to know that 
I will do my part, no matter how 
small, to contribute to the well-
being of all citizens, and not just 
those who look like me.”
And… it goes on.
For Jews, amongst the highest 
forms of praise a person can 
receive is to be referred to (in 
Yiddish) as a mensch. This word 
translates roughly into “a person 
of noble character, of integrity 
and honor.” The Carnegie Mellon 
students showed their collective 
menschlichkeit this past week. 
I thank the students for their 
contributions this past week 
and am deeply grateful to be 
part of this amazing community. 
Together, we are all stronger.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: STUDENT SOLIDARITY FOR THE JEWISH COMMUNITY
Sri Lanka faces a burgeoning constitutional crisis
LIKHITHA CHINTAREDDY
Staffwriter
On Oct. 26, Sri Lankan 
President Maithripala Sirisena 
of the Sri Lanka Freedom 
Party (SLFP) sacked the Prime 
Minister, Ranil Wikramasinghe 
of the United National Party 
(UNP), ending a three-year-
old alliance often marked with 
internal turbulence, and setting 
off a Constitutional crisis in the 
island nation. He then installed 
an ally-turned-foe-turned-ally, 
Former President Mahindra 
Rajapaksa of the Sri Lanka 
Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), as 
Prime Minister. Two weeks later, 
on Nov. 9, President Sirisena 
dissolved the Sri Lankan 
Parliament and called a snap 
general election to be held on 
Jan. 5. He also suspended the 
House until Nov. 16, based on 
reports released at the time of 
the writing of this article.
This latest political tussle 
between Rajapaksa and 
Wikramasinghe has experts 
and lawyers divided on 
the constitutional legality 
of Sirisena’s action. Under 
Article 33 (2)(c) in the 19th 
Amendment of the Sri Lankan 
Constitution, “in addition to the 
powers, duties, and functions 
expressly conferred or imposed 
on, or assigned to the President 
by the Constitution or other 
written law, the President 
shall never have the power to 
summon, prorogue and dissolve 
Parliament.” The president’s 
ardent supporters cite this 
article to defend his actions. 
However, there are also serious 
problems, as Article 70(1) of the 
19th Amendment also states that 
the president cannot dissolve 
the Parliament before four and a 
half years into its five-year term 
unless requested by two-thirds 
of its members.
Article 33(2) is also a 
general provision describing 
the powers and functions of the 
president, including the power 
of the president to dissolve the 
parliament. But Article 70(1) is 
a specific provision that limits 
this power of the president in 
regards to the dissolution of the 
parliament. And based on the 
standard rule of interpretation, 
a general provision must always 
be read subject to a specific 
provision.
As the Wikramasinghe-
Sirisena coalition had lasted 
a little more than three years, 
this renders the Sirisena’s move 
to dissolve the Parliament 
unconstitutional, according to 
several legal experts.
In 2015, when Sirisena and 
Wikramasinghe’s parties, which 
are rivals and ideological polar 
opposites, teamed up for the 
elections to defeat incumbent 
Rajapaksa, it caused ripples of 
surprise all around. However, 
now that Wikramasinghe’s 
political star and public 
popularity has waned thanks to 
slowed economic growth and 
several internal tussles between 
the former-rivals-turned-allies, 
Sirisena covertly formed an 
alliance with Rajapaksa. One 
of the main reasons, according 
to reports, is Wikramasinghe’s 
strongly worded statement 
that he issued in New Delhi 
after meeting the Indian Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi on Oct. 
20 about the delay in Indian 
projects in Sri Lanka, that seemed 
to be blaming the president. 
Wikramasinghe’s visit to India 
also came in the backdrop 
of reports in which Sirisena 
accused the Indian government’s 
Intelligence Agency, Research 
and Analysis Wing (RAW), of 
plotting his assassination, which 
Wikramasinghe repeatedly 
denied ahead of his visity in order 
to maintain Indian confidence in 
his government. Another reason, 
analysts speculate, could be the 
rejection of two of Sirisena’s 
nominees for the Supreme court 
and an Appeals Court.
Whatever the reasons may be, 
the Rajapaksa-Sirisena alliance 
is back, sparking fear of violence 
in Sri Lanka. Rajapaksa is known 
for quelling the insurgency 
and ending the civil war with 
the ethnic Tamilian separatist 
group, Liberation of Tamil 
Tigers Eelam (LTTE). But the 
massive human rights violations, 
including the murder of LTTE 
chief Prabhakaran’s 12-year-old 
son, who was handed a pack of 
biscuits before being executed, 
have cast the international 
spotlight on the various 
methods of suppression used by 
Rajapaksa and the Sri Lankan 
army in Tamil-dominated 
regions like Jaffna, even after 
the war ended. Rajapaksa is 
also very pro-Chinam and his 
tenure saw massive amounts of 
Chinese investments, including 
the construction of a port in Sri 
Lanka. In fact, when he lost the 
elections in 2015, Rajapaksa 
accused India of orchestrating 
his defeat.
Reports indicate that prior 
to his firing, Wikramasinghe 
had argued with Sirisena 
about a proposal to grant the 
development of a Colombo 
port project to an India-Japan 
joint venture. Wikramasinghe 
had allegedly argued that the 
decision should respect the 
memorandum of understanding 
signed by Sri Lanka, India, and 
Japan. However, reports suggest 
that Sirisena wanted to reject 
the proposal.
These reports seem to suggest 
that the tussle for power between 
India and China for investments 
in Sri Lanka may have led to this 
latest political crisis in Sri Lanka. 
While India remains concerned 
that China intends to turn Sri 
Lanka into a military outpost, 
which could greatly harm 
India’s security and territorial 
integrity due to its proximity to 
Sri Lanka, China continues to 
grow its portfolio of investments 
in Sri Lanka, welcoming it into 
its ambitious One Belt One 
Road (OBOR) program in 2017 
and subsequently increasing 
investment.
Wikramasinghe’s United 
National Party is going to the 
Supreme Court to challenge 
what it calls the illegal 
dissolution of the Parliament by 
Sirisena. Meanwhile, countries 
around the world are observing 
the situation cautiously. The 
Japan International Cooperation 
Agency put a $1.4 billion soft 
debt to a light railway project in 
Colombo on hold, while the U.S. 
Department of State released a 
statement calling on President 
Sirisena to reconvene the 
Parliament to let democratically 
elected representatives decide 
who will lead the government.

“The thing with science is that 
you can’t just do it from a cold, hard 
perspective,” says Andrew Wolff, a 
biology PhD student in the Mellon 
College of Science. “It’s very tied to 
your own personal beliefs.”
Objectivity — the removal of all 
personal bias from an experimen-
tal setting — is a central concept 
in scienti?c research. Practically, 
however, experiments are designed 
by humans, algorithms are written 
by humans, and journal articles are 
edited and approved by humans. A 
researcher’s perspective inevitably 
in?uences their work.
Unfortunately, in STEM, not all 
perspectives are considered equal.
We’ve long been culturally aware 
of the challenges that women face 
in scienti?c research, and there’s a 
general understanding of the preju-
dice people of color face in STEM 
?elds. The experiences of LGBTQ+ 
people in science are much less well 
known, for various reasons: While 
the numbers of other underrepre-
sented groups in STEM are increas-
ing, queer researchers have always 
been present, as long as they man-
aged to hide their identity. There has 
also been signi?cantly less research 
into LGBTQ+ experiences in STEM.
However, as academic research 
and cultural awareness have caught 
up over the past ten years or so, 
LGBTQ+ scientists have rapidly 
become more visible.
Organizations advocating for 
LGBTQ+ scienti?c researchers have 
existed for decades, but thanks to 
technology and heightened societal 
awareness, LGBTQ+ scientists are 
networking more than ever before. 
oSTEM (Out in STEM), a chapter-
based professional organization for 
LGBTQ+ researchers founded in 
2009, now has chapters at over 75 
universities. The Queer in STEM 
Project has tackled the lack of quan-
titative data on the LGBTQ+ STEM 
experience by surveying queer re-
searchers about their experiences, 
in the U.S. and worldwide.
The internet has provided space 
not just for advocacy, but commu-
nity. “With the rise of social media, 
and especially Twitter, as a ?eld for 
academics, it’s a lot easier to main-
tain connections with other queer 
civil engineers, follow each other, 
and talk,” says Daniel Gingerich, a 
postdoctoral researcher in Carnegie 
Mellon’s Department of Civil and 
Environmental Engineering. Many 
research ?elds and institutions now 
have online “Out Lists” that serve 
as a kind of directory that LGBTQ+ 
academics can use to connect or 
seek out mentorship.
Increasing LGBTQ+ visibility is 
incredibly important for future sci-
entists: The National School Climate 
Survey conducted by GLSEN (an 
organization that advocates for 
LGBTQ+ issues in K-12 education) 
found in 2013 that high schoolers 
whose science classes positively ad-
dressed LGBTQ+ topics were twice 
as likely to enter STEM majors in col-
lege — but in 2015, only 3 percent 
of the 10,000 high school students 
surveyed had seen positive repre-
sentation of LGBTQ-related topics in 
science class.
Visibility — and awareness 
— is equally important for those 
already working in STEM, who 
often experience homophobia and 
transphobia that comes from a 
place of ignorance. “As a PhD I had 
several con?ate my sexuality with 
pedophilia and insinuate that I 
would have dif?culty ?nding a job 
because I was a kind of sexual devi-
ant,” explains Chase Mendenhall, 
Assistant Curator of Birds, Ecology, 
and Conservation at the Carnegie 
Museum of Natural History.
Sarah Frisco, a PhD student in 
materials science, says of their expe-
riences in chemistry research, “There 
were a lot of ‘bro-y’ guys making 
rape jokes, and I was like, this is not

Out in the sciences: ‘Without limits and without fear’
Is ‘Oumuamua a probe sent by aliens? Probably not
AI simulates reasons behind human religious con?ict
FRANK HU
Assistant Forum Editor
When you think of an alien, you 
probably picture a little gray man 
in a skintight jumpsuit piloting a 
?ying saucer, not an amorphous, 
cigar-shaped hunk of rock hurtling 
through our solar system.
Scientists studying the mysteri-
ous interstellar object ‘Oumuamua 
didn’t make that connection either 
until Avi Loeb, chair of Harvard’s 
astronomy department, suggested 
it. Though not many took him seri-
ously, given how much uncertainty 
surrounds this visitor from outer 
space, Loeb is not backing down.
‘Oumuamua, a Hawaiian name 
that roughly means “?rst distant 
messenger,” is an asteroid ?rst 
discovered on Oct. 19, 2017, and 
it’s been puzzling researchers 
ever since. Not only was its trajec-
tory unlike anything previously 
encountered, but it displayed some 
strange behavior that made it dif?-
cult to classify. Observers ?rst classi-
?ed it as a comet, but it was quickly 
changed to an asteroid because 
there was no coma, the glowing 
“envelope” surrounding the body of 
the comet due to the sublimation of 
ice caused by the sun. Researchers 
later changed it back to a comet be-
cause the object displayed strange 
accelerations that couldn’t be ex-
plained by gravity alone, indicating 
that something must be coming out 
of the comet.
Loeb offers an alternate explana-
tion that would neatly answer all the 
questions about ‘Oumuamua, if it 
weren’t so implausible. According to 
Loeb’s paper, the object is a piece of 
debris from a destroyed alien probe 
powered by a theoretical solar sail, 
a propulsion technology based on 
the idea of harnessing the radiation 
emitted by stars. Over time, a solar 
sail could generate enough velocity 
to exit a solar system.
‘Oumuamua could be a busted-
up alien probe gliding through 
space on a solar sail, or it could be 
an unexplainable low-activity com-
et. There’s no way of verifying ei-
ther way, because ‘Oumuamua has 
long since left our solar system. In 
fact, because its proposed size and 
shape were off estimation, no one 
could even get a good photo.
Though our interstellar visi-
tor is gone, the debate over its 
classi?cation remains. Loeb’s theory 
has taken the media by storm, the 
widespread coverage leading to the 
spread of rumors and sensationalist 
content.
Predictably, astronomers aren’t 
thrilled about this. As Benjamin 
Weiner of the University of Arizona 
expressed in a tweet this past 
Wednesday, Loeb’s speculation does 
a disservice to the scienti?c com-
munity, with scientists now working 
overtime to stop the spread of false 
information. In a time when science 
is often decried as fake news (think 
about all those global warming de-
niers), these frustrations are under-
standable.
Whatever you may think about 
‘Oumuamua, its brief visit reminds 
us all that the universe is astound-
ingly large, and that we are but 
a single speck of dust in a cosmic 
ocean. Who knows? Maybe there 
are aliens out there, launching 
more probes as we speak.

ASHWIN SRINIVASAN
Assistant SciTech Editor
Are people naturally violent? 
Can religious factors create anxi-
ety between groups that leads to 
violence?
These are the questions that 
a new study in The Journal for 
Arti?cial Societies and Social 
Simulation sought to answer. 
A team of researchers from 
the University of Oxford, 
Boston University, and the 
University of Agder in 
Norway combined com-
puter modeling and 
cognitive psychology 
to develop an arti?cial 
intelligence (AI) that 
emulated human religious 
behaviors in order to un-
derstand the conditions, trig-
gers, and patterns of religious 
violence.
For the ?rst time, multi-agent 
AI is being used to create psycho-
logically realistic computer 
models in research. Justin 
E. Lane, a member of the 
research team, noted the 
computational advance-
ment this study represents 
over previous applications of 
AI. “99 [percent] of the general 
public are most familiar with AI 
that uses machine learning to 
automate human tasks like — 
classifying something, such 
as tweets to be positive or 
negative etc., but our study uses 
something called multi-agent 
AI to create a psychologically 
realistic model of a human, 
for example — how do they 
think, and particularly how 
do we identify with groups? 
Why would someone iden-
tify as Christian, Jewish 
or Muslim etc. Es-
sentially, how do 
our personal beliefs 
align with how a 
group de?nes itself?”
Applying theoretical 
cognitive psychology 
literature allowed 
the team to 
translate the 
workings of 
the human 
mind into 
a computer 
program, 
specifically 
how humans 
process 
information and compare it 
to their personal experiences. 
The simulated environment 
contained millions of AI-based 
human agents with differing 
characteristics like age and eth-
nicity. While everyday tasks 
such as working and studying 
were not emulated, the simu-
lation included the possibil-
ity of environmental hazards 
like disasters and disease, as 
well as groups of individuals 
interacting with each other.
The study reveals that 
humans are naturally peaceful, 
but can be willing to engage in or 
endorse violence when others 
go against core beliefs de?ning 
their identity. Long periods of 
mutually escalating tensions be-
tween social groups occur due 
to outlier members, who deny 
a group’s core beliefs or values 
and overwhelm other individu-
als. In general, anxiety and agita-
tion arises when people feel that 
their belief systems are chal-
lenged. However, the sim-
ulation found that anxi-
ety led to violence in just 
20 percent of scenarios 
triggered by individuals 
contradicting group identity, 
leaving the cause of other violent 
engagements a mystery.
Lane said, “Ultimately, to use 
AI to study religion or culture, 
we have to look at modeling 
human psychology because our 
psychology is the foundation for 
religion and culture, so the root 
causes of things like religious 
violence rest in how our minds 
process the information that our 
world presents it.”Ryan Sunada-Wong/Junior Staff Artist

From LGBTQ+, A7
 where I’m gonna discuss queer iden-
tity...In the place where I worked af-
ter [undergrad], I was the only per-
son who could be read female in the 
whole company, and it was the same 
situation. Rape jokes, fat jokes, gay 
jokes, all of it.”
Much of the discrimination and 
discomfort LGBTQ+ researchers 
face can be ascribed to the hyper-
masculine climate in many scien-
ti?c ?elds. A 2013 study found that 
LGBTQ+ scientists were more likely 
to be open about their identities 
when they worked in ?elds with 
more women, such as biology. “In 
Yellowstone, where I did a lot of 
work, wolves and bears were for the 
macho mountain men, while birds 
and butter?ies were for women and 
others,” explains Mendenhall. “I 
have always depended on women 
to help me navigate hostile environ-
ments of toxic masculinity — espe-
cially in the ?eld where safety is a 
concern.”
In highly masculine environ-
ments, it’s easy to be ostracized — 
even when there’s no active preju-
dice at work. “It was dif?cult for 
me to socialize because it was just 
a bunch of straight guys,” explains 
a PhD student in computer science 
who asked to remain anonymous. 
“Like they would talk about girls, 
they would talk about cricket…
You feel like you’re missing out on 
opportunities because you’re not 
able to socialize with them the way 
they’re able to do it with each other; 
you’re not able to connect with 
them. I just never felt like I was a 
part of the group.”
However, it isn’t really the 
presence of straight men that 
causes LGBTQ+ researchers to 
feel excluded. A study published in 
March of this year found that gay 
and bisexual men who begin their 
academic careers in STEM ?elds are 
less likely to persist in STEM than 
heterosexual men, but lesbians and 
bisexual women are more likely 
to continue in STEM than straight 
women. Many researchers believe 
this shows that it’s not necessar-
ily just women being devalued in 
STEM, but femininity — or anyone 
perceived as feminine.
Most LGBTQ+ scientists are 
very conscious of animosity toward 
traditional femininity — especially 
trans researchers, who usually have 
a heightened awareness of gender 
presentation. Many nonbinary sci-
entists feel an obligation to exter-
nally present or identify as more 
feminine, to push back against the 
male-dominated environment. “I’ve 
met a lot of younger women who 
aren’t sure whether or not to be in 
STEM, and they’re like, ‘but I see 
you’re doing it’,” says Frisco. “I want 
to inspire you, but what you’re see-
ing isn’t necessarily what I am…
When trying to make my own deci-
sions about gender, it’s very hard to 
do that individually.”
Everyone who’s part of a group 
historically excluded from STEM re-
search experiences marginalization 
differently, and many people experi-
ence it on several fronts. One of the 
earlier large-scale surveys of queer 
researchers — the American Physi-
cal Society’s 2016 LGBT+ Climate in 
Physics Report — found that among 
LGBTQ+ physicists (particularly 
among trans researchers), people 
of color and women were the most 
likely to experience compounded 
prejudice and harassment. LGBTQ+ 
researchers who aren’t U.S. citizens 
also have more considerations to 
balance, trying to stay safe and in 
good legal standing in both the U.S. 
and their countries of origin, while 
still af?rming their identity.
The overlap in marginalized iden-
tities also has a more positive side: 
when one group ?ghts prejudice, 
other groups usually stand to bene?t 
as well. Vivian Miranda, a postdoc-
toral researcher in the University of 
Arizona’s Department of Astronomy, 
recounts one of her ?rst academic 
presentations after coming out as a 
trans woman. When she asked her 
cis colleagues for advice on profes-
sional attire, she “was shocked that 
even the most well-known women in 
my ?eld feared using dresses while 
presenting a seminar” in order to 
be taken more seriously. “I decided 
to retribute...I picked my best dress, 
and I presented wearing it — I could 
see my colleagues were cheering for 
me. I had just broken a new barrier 
[for] all of us.”
In her previous position at the 
University of Pennsylvania, Miranda 
encountered one of the most com-
mon obstacles for trans researchers: 
the university refused to update her 
name on her university ID card or in 
the HR system. Diana Parno, a pro-
fessor in Carnegie Mellon’s physics 
department, is a straight, cisgen-
der woman who changed her name 
when she married and had the exact 
same problem as Miranda. “It’s been 
more than ten years and my whole 
scienti?c reputation has been built 
with my new name, but I have still 
had to have some extremely frustrat-
ing arguments with IT departments 
to get a professional username 
change — and with one, I’ve given 
up. How much worse it would be if 
the old name brought up symptoms 
of gender dysphoria!”
Parno, a particle physicist 
who studies neutrinos, was a lead 
writer for the second edition of the 
Best Practices Guide for LGBT+ 
Inclusivity in Physics and Astrono-
my, published in April. The docu-
ment gives guidelines for ensur-
ing the research environment is 
safe, welcoming, and accessible to 
LGBTQ+ physicists at many levels 
of academia, from the classroom to 
the department to the institution. 
(The guidelines are not necessarily 
speci?c to the ?eld of physics).
“Little things are important for 
two reasons,” explains Parno. “First, 
though they may not seem big on a 
grand policy scale, they can be very 
signi?cant to the individuals expe-
riencing them. Second, little things 
add up to really shape the overall 
climate.”
Wolff, an of?cer for ALLIES Grad, 
has seen how traditional biological 
terminology can ‘other’ LGBTQ+ 
scientists, particularly when talk-
ing about gender. “People that talk 
about mutations, or mutants — 
along the lines of like, sex deter-
mination — they usually refer to it 
in a negative context.” He believes 
that open discussions on how words 
can be used differently can make a 
research environment much more 
inclusive.
Even in physics, hypothetically 
much more removed from human 
affairs, language makes a differ-
ence. “There are two research com-
munities in particle physics whose 
traditional acronyms included 
the slur f**,” says Parno. “It was 
a coincidence that the slurs were 
there, but that didn’t make it any 
less of an ugly surprise for many 
scientists when they came across it. 
After years of pushback, in the last 
year both communities are moving 
away from these acronyms.”
Explicit acknowledgement of 
LGBTQ+ researchers in university 
policy still isn’t the standard. Often, 
departments that are hiring ask 
women and racial and ethnic minor-
ities to apply, but don’t explicitly en-
courage LGBTQ+ applicants. While 
this omission is likely because the 
research on LGBTQ+ exclusion in 
STEM is much more recent and not 
as well known, it can leave academic 
job seekers wondering whether 
they’re heading into a homophobic 
or transphobic environment.
Many queer researchers express 
frustration at the lack of awareness 
of how being LGBTQ+ can impact 
a research career, even in the most 
welcoming settings. “As a queer 
person, you have to deal with a lot 
more things,” explains the computer 
science researcher. “It’s not just the 
fact that you’re working on dif?cult 
[research]... Your personal life is go-
ing to occupy some amount of your 
time and energy, and that is going to 
eat away from the time and energy 
you can give to your work.” While 
anyone can have personal dif?cul-
ties, LGBTQ+ scientists frequently 
encounter stress and obstacles that 
might not even occur to those out-
side the queer community.
After giving a talk, Miranda 
describes being asked if she knew a 
certain male PhD student, and real-
izing that the person was referring to 
her, pre-transition. “I had to explain 
that I was that student! No problem 
in the end — the person was quite 
sweet and thoughtful — but it re-
minded me that my career would be 
broken in half permanently. All the 
friendly interactions that I had in 
the past and that were important to 
project my name in the ?eld will not 
be automatically translated to my 
new identity.”
However, most agree that vis-
ibility within the STEM community 
is increasing — and science itself is 
becoming more inclusive.
Mendenhall explains, “During 
my PhD I was fortunate enough to 
work and teach with Stanford pro-
fessor Joan Roughgarden,” a trans 
biologist who challenged traditional 
ideas of sex and gender in nature. 
“Her research and teaching pio-
neered a new narrative of inclusive 
evolutionary biology...Roughgarden 
argues that sex evolved to generate 
diversity and diversity is bene?cial 
and critical for the process of natu-
ral selection.” In the same way, Men-
denhall argues, diversity is critical 
for the advancement of science — a 
view increasingly common among 
researchers. “Science advances fast-
est when scientists are free to apply 
their intelligence and imagination to 
the exploration of the universe with-
out limits and without fear,” reads 
the physics inclusivity guide.
Retaining scientists from diverse 
backgrounds will take some big 
changes, and a lot of small ones, 
says Parno: “Pushing for more inclu-
sive and welcoming study groups. 
Allowing academic travel by train or 
car, where possible, even if it takes 
longer, because encounters with the 
TSA are so fraught for many trans 
people. Facilitating author name 
changes on previously published 
papers.”
Inclusive policies in the academic 
environment can’t be effective un-
less they’re supported by the cul-
ture. “Students have a huge impact 
on the social environment,” says 
Parno. “My advice is to be openly 
inclusive and thoughtful — if you 
are concerned about making sure 
the environment is a good one for 
your LGBTQ peers, you are on the 
right path. Don’t assume that your 
male labmate is looking for a girl-
friend, or your female study partner 
a boyfriend.
“Welcome people who aren’t like 
you into your study group; you may 
make new friends.”

On Saturday, the Tartans brought the Academic Bowl trophy back to Pittsburgh after winning the 33rd iteration of the rivalry game against Case Western Reserve University in overtime, 29–23. In overtime, the Spartans 
started with the ball, an interception by junior cornerback Anthony Kennon’s gave the ball back to the Tartans. Junior running back Chris Haas topped off his career day with a nine-yard touchdown run to win the game.
Leicester City remembers Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha
YANNICK SHETTY MENTON
Junior Staffwriter
On Oct. 27, the entire soccer 
world suffered an incredible loss 
when Thai multi-billionaire Vichai 
Srivaddhanaprabbha, owner and 
chairman of Leicester City F.C., 
was killed in a helicopter crash. 
The widely adored sixty-year-old 
had been the chairman of the 
English Premier League soccer 
club since the company King 
Power, of which he was founder 
and CEO, purchased the club back 
in 2010.
At that time, Leicester City had 
just been relegated to play the 
2008-09 season in the third tier 
of English soccer, having never 
played below the second tier 
before that. Their meteoric rise 
to fame and success in the years 
that followed has been largely 
credited to the impetus given 
by Vichai’s new ownership. His 
death, and those of three others in 
the helicopter, came as he left the 
club’s stadium after a game a few 
weeks ago, and the entire city of 
Leicester mourned with the rest of 
the soccer world.
Six years after slogging it in 
the third tier of English soccer, 
Leicester made it to the Premier 
League in 2014, reaching England’s 
top ?ight of soccer. With only nine 
of the 38 games left to play, and 
only four wins of the previous 29 
games, Leicester sat at the bottom 
of the table, seemingly destined 
for relegation, ending their short 
spell in this elite tier. An unfore-
seeable turnaround saw them win 
eight of the last nine games and 
thus maintain their position in 
the league, but the celebrations 
were cut short when the manager, 
who’d garnered heroic status with 
the fans, decided to quit his job 
that summer.
The next season, to most 
Premier League viewers’ surprise, 
took off fairly well for the Foxes (as 
they are nicknamed), with players 
Riyadh Mahrez, N’golo Kante, 
and especially forward Jamie 
Vardy exploding onto the scene 
as top-class players. New manager 
Claudio Ranieri found a real 
rhythm, and Leicester City found 
themselves in the ?fth position, 
having lost only one game 10 
games into the season. Though 
unexpected it wasn’t uncommon 
for a weaker team to start well 
like this in the Premier League, 
and all expected and awaited 
the eventual dip in form. As the 
season progressed, Leicester 
City became the fairytale heroes, 
somehow managing to maintain 
this form and ?ght for a place in 
the top two.
The world was rooting for this 
underdog team. They were given 
a 5000/1 outside odds of winning 
the title, lower than each of the 
other 19 clubs, yet they were 
?ying high. In May 2016, Chelsea 
scored an equalizing goal against 
Tottenham Hotspur, determining 
that no club could mathematically 
reach Leicester’s points tally in the 
remaining three games, crowning 
them champions. It was a 
celebration of the sheer impossible 
becoming true. Leicester City gave 
the world a story of hope, that the 
underdog team could overcome 
the traditional top teams like 
Manchester United or Arsenal. It 
was a miraculous win showcasing 
the true unpredictability of sport.
Years prior at Vichai’s 
inauguration as chairman he 
stated he would make Leicester 
a top-?ve club, to much disbelief 
from both Leicester City fans 
themselves and the soccer 
world. In being an integral part 
of achieving this dream, he 
became more than just any other 
chairman to the fans. In just eight 
years, he had embedded himself 
into the city, where the millions he 
poured into the football club were 
matched by his philanthropic 
efforts, donating millions to 
various local charities, social 
development programs, and the 
local hospital to aid improvements 
to a city that he embraced.
A man remembered by many as 
being the one behind the counters 
at the stadium serving free 
doughnuts and beer to the fans, he 
truly became a man of the people 
succeeded in creating something 
magical for. For Leicester fans, 
it was the little things that made 
Vichai the face of generosity and 
benevolence, it is what uplifted 
the entire sports community and 
had everyone celebrating with 
him and his club in their successes.
His untimely departure is 
tragic, but his legacy has already 
taken shape; Leicester City 
announced he will be honored 
with a statue outside the stadium. 
In the days after the accident, 
fans placed ?owers and jerseys 
and personal mementos outside 
the stadium in remembrance. In 
the new age of sports dominated 
by solely monetary goals and 
functions, Vichai brought 
something personal to the 
pitch. In this moment of shock 
and sadness Leicester City fans 
remember the happiness and 
hope that was brought to the 
sporting community by a man, his 
club, and his endeavor.

TRAN, from A10
Off the ?eld, Tran is president 
of Plaidvocates, a student-
athlete-run organization 
that focuses on being a peer-
to-peer support team, help-
ing fellow student athletes 
balance academic and athletic 
life. Every team at Carnegie 
Mellon has representatives from 
Plaidvocates; Tran is one for the 
football team in addition to being 
president of the organization.
“I de?nitely appreciate the 
people who helped me and spoke 
to me and took time out of their 
day to get me through what I 
dealt with last [year], and to see 
that reciprocated through this 
organization really is something 
I’m really proud of,” he said.
Alongside his mechanical and 
biomedical engineering course-
work, Tran has also done research 
for various professors and labs on 
campus. Currently, he is working 
on a modular snake medical robot 
for his CIT Honors Research. 
Its purpose is to be used during 
surgical procedures in minimally 
invasive ways. With the robotics 
component, the snake can access 
the vessels in the body through a 
less invasive hole.
Looking to the future beyond 
his senior year, Tran is interested 
in pursuing an integrated master’s 
degree from the mechanical 
engineering department, though 
he is also open to working in the 
surgical robotics ?eld. Because 
he took a medical redshirt year to 
recover from his heart condition, 
Tran has one year of athletic 
eligibility left to play football at 
Carnegie Mellon. Football has 
been part of his life for so long, 
and the integrated master’s pro-
gram is an opportunity to play 
football for one ?nal year.
“I think my favorite thing 
about the football is just the 
competitiveness,” Tran said. “I’m 
a highly competitive person. On 
the ?eld, it’s a very competitive 
mindset. I try to pump up the 
guys every time before the ?rst 
snap of the game. We’re out here 
for one job, one job only, and 
that’s to win. We’ll get it done. It’s 
a source of pride.”
With the ?nal game of the 
season against Geneva this 
Saturday, Nov. 17, Tran looks to 
go out with a win.

FANTASY, from A10
The losing team, Tunnard’s 
team Slugs, had no players score 
above 20 points, which probably 
explains the team’s loss this 
week. Slugs’ defense, of the 
Jacksonville Jaguars, and kicker, 
Jake Elliot of the Philadelphia 
Eagles together had a total 
fantasy score of zero points. It 
was an unlucky week for Slugs 
(but not as unlucky as my week).
TARTAN FANTASY over newz, 
127.22 to 80.26
Three players led Photo 
Editor Lisa Qian’s team, TARTAN 
FANTASY, to a big win this 
week, beating News Editor Nora 
Mattson’s team, newz by 46.96 
points. Those players were 
Panthers running back Christian 
McCaffrey, Saints wide receiver 
Michael Thomas, and Houston 
Texans quarterback Deshaun 
Watson, who in total scored an 
impressive 75.12 points
Mattson’s newz did have one 
big scorer this week: Atlanta 
Falcons running back Tevin 
Coleman who scored 27.6 points. 
Tennessee Titans running back 
Dion Lewis and Texans wide 
receiver DeAndre Hopkins had 
the second and third highest 
scores of 18.20 and 16.50, 
respectively. Unfortunately, 
newz had two players who 
scored a total of 0 points this 
week, definitely contributing to 
the loss.
Gin and Bear It over 
mmichelle123, 99.44 to 79.16
Ah, finally we’ve come to the 
part of the recap where I tell 
you all about my devastating 
misfortune: losing to Yang’s team 
Gin and Bear It by 20.28 points. 
I’m not sure where things went 
wrong, but I do know that Gin 
and Bear It has this guy named 
Jared Goff, Rams quarterback, 
score a total of 29.34 points. I 
guess that’s impressive. This, 
without a doubt, is what led 
to Yang’s victory, since all the 
other players on her team scored 
below twenty points, with 
four of them scoring below ten 
points. Gin and Bear It’s kicker, 
Justin Tucker of the Ravens, and 
defense of the New York Jets did, 
however, score pretty well with 
10 and 8 points, respectively.
My team just had a really 
bad week. My highest scorer 
was Pittsburgh Steelers wide 
receiver Antonio Brown, who 
only scored 10.20 points, while 
the rest…well I’d rather not 
talk about it. But, my kicker, 
Saints’ Wil Lutz and my defense, 
of the Minnesota Vikings, did 
score a combined 33 points. 
Unfortunately, these scores 
weren’t enough to save me from 
the bottom ranking this week; 
Yang’s team moves up while I 
take its place at the bottom of 
the standing. But it’s all good! 
Hopefully next week will go 
better!
Anyway, tune in next week for 
another Tartan Fantasy Football 
recap from the week’s biggest 
loser! Le’s team futbol will take 
Miller’s league-leading Last 
Manning Standing, Tunnard’s 
Slugs and Sio’s GOAT but 
Ironically will square off against 
each other, Mattson’s newz will 
play Yang’s Gin and Bear It, 
while I will try to get out of the 
bottom versus Qian’s TARTAN 
FANTASY.

MATTHEW BENUSA
Assistant Sports Editor
This is the ?rst week of The 
Tartan’s brand spanking new 
sports column, Penalty Shouts. 
Drawing inspiration from The New 
Yorker’s column Daily Shouts, this 
satire-fueled column will focus on 
anything and everything funny 
in the sports world. The column 
will be a short piece each week 
— we would never interrupt the 
regularly scheduled programming 
of The Tartan — about something, 
or somebody, in the sports world 
that is deserving of our comedic 
attention.
Our ?rst Penalty Shout goes 
out to J.R. Smith for publicly 
discussing a potential trade from 
the Cavaliers, in spite of the NBA’s 
Collective Bargaining Agreement 
(CBA). Smith did an interview 
after another game spent on the 
bench smoking a joint, and with 
bright, red eyes and a bushy tail, 
he said, “I deserve to play, I need 
to be traded.” The 33-year-old 
shooting guard averages seven 
points a game in seven games 
played this season; his contract 
is worth $14.5 million, and 
the three-point shooting and 
controversy-sparking player has 
hit only a third of his threes so far 
this season.
Smith started his ?rst game 
of the season last Wednesday 
against the Thunder. The veteran 
had to earn his way back into the 
jam-packed, young roster of the 
Cavaliers, which features huge 
names, like Cedi Osman. In the 
game, he showed why the team 
needed him after missing a few 
threes, and frankly, the team is 
in?nitely better with him, at least 
on the bench. That way, Smith 
can shout “Kobe!” whenever 
sharpshooter Jordan Clarkson 
shoots a deep fade-away two that 
caroms into the front row.
That said, it’s important for 
Smith to ?nd happiness with, or 
without, the Cavaliers. Over the 
years, we’ve seen what happens 
when he doesn’t want to play for a 
team — take the Zhejiang Golden 
Bulls of the Chinese Basketball 
Association (CBA), for example. 
In the lockout season of 2011, 
Smith played for the Golden 
Bulls, but his agent “forgot” to 
include an opt-out clause in the 
contract for him to return to 
American basketball.
Now, Smith is stuck on the 
bench for a team that doesn’t see 
his true potential as the next (but 
older) Stephen Curry. Who else is 
going to shoot that many threes a 
game? J.R. can. Smith currently 
isn’t  utilized to the fullest extent 
of his ability, and so he is fairly 
demanding  the Cavaliers trade 
him to a team that will value his 
skills as the best player to towel 
sweat off Lebron’s forehead. 
The public statement of the 
trade is what got Smith into 
trouble with the league. Players 
before Smith have talked to their 
team’s front of?ce, but it takes a 
real dunderhead to actually tell 
the press, “I want a trade.” Even 
Timberwolves forward Jimmy 
Butler has worked his way around 
the system, playing the league’s 
coy mistress to Smith’s bumbling 
buffoon. Eventually, by way 
of fax, the league of?ce heard 
about the incident, and balded 
NBA Commissioner, Adam Silver, 
started a rumor about the threat 
of a ?ne.
After hearing the threat to ?ne 
Smith for violating the collective 
bargaining agreement, Smith 
said, “Let him ?ne me. I’ll land 
a plane on his beautiful, bald, 
waxed head.” For the record, a 
plane could not land on Silver’s 
head. Other players around the 
league had comments to make the 
rumor of a ?ne for Smith. Butler 
said, “I would never publicly ask 
for a trade, but I wouldn’t mind 
if the Timberwolves sent my 
contract to another team in a se-
ries of roster changes for a player 
to be named later.” Boston Celtics 
point guard (and ex-teammate of 
Smith) Kyrie Irving asked, “How 
does the trade carousel work if 
the Earth is ?at?” Another old 
teammate, Lebron James, now 
playing with the Lakers, had only 
one thing to say about the inci-
dent: “Who?”

It’s the second quarter. 
Defensive end Long Tran checks 
into the game. The opposing 
quarterback scrambles to the 
right, with Tran in pursuit. He 
pushes the quarterback into the 
sideline, causing an interception. 
Tran’s teammates cheer him on at 
the end of the play.
That was two years ago, in 
a game against Washington 
University in St. Louis, when 
Tran was a sophomore. After 
spending most of his ?rst year at 
Carnegie Mellon in the weight 
room and studying ?lm, it was 
the moment when he felt he had 
graduated from high school foot-
ball to college football.
Tran, now a senior mechanical 
and biomedical engineering 
major, is a leader on the Tartan 
football team. Earlier this 
season, his career day versus 
Saint Vincent — ?nishing with 
three sacks for a loss of 23 yards 
and eight tackles, three solo — 
earned him University Athletic 
Association (UAA) honors for 
Defensive Player of the Week.
Tran started playing football 
in grade school and is now in his 
13th year. From his ?rst game, he 
was hooked. He hasn’t stopped 
playing since.
“I really enjoyed the game the 
?rst time I put pads on,” Tran said 
in an interview with The Tartan. 
“It was really a great experience 
because at that time, I’d never 
had any exposure to teams and 
goal-oriented stuff. It was really 
fun, getting to bond with other 
people and make friends in a 
unique way.”
Fast-forward a decade, and 
Tran was making decisions about 
his college future. Carnegie 
Mellon came calling, and he found 
a perfect ?t. He had the chance 
to play collegiate-level football, 
as well as a great opportunity to 
pursue engineering, which he 
knew he wanted to do. But like 
any student athlete, balancing 
both academics and athletic 
responsibilities was a challenge 
for Tran, and something he has 
learned to do throughout his 
time at Carnegie Mellon.
“It’s de?nitely had its ups and 
downs. I try to prioritize: ‘Do I 
have energy enough to get the 
?lm study done? I know I have 
a test tomorrow, so how can I 
proportion [it] out?’” Tran said. 
“I de?nitely think I’ve improved, 
time management wise. I know 
when to push my limits…but I 
also know my peak limit. The 
athletic mindset really helps that. 
You just try to get the job done in 
whatever way you can.”
One of Tran’s biggest 
challenges came in his junior 
year. After fully participating 
in workouts the summer 
before the season, a heartbeat 
reading showed that Tran had 
an irregular heartbeat. He was 
soon diagnosed with premature 
ventricular contractions (PVCs) 
— extra heartbeats that disrupt 
regular heart rhythm. While 
PVCs are common and often 
cause few symptoms, further 
tests revealed that Tran had 
PVCs at an especially high rate 
and that his cardiac output was 
abnormally low. He underwent 
a cardiac ablation procedure, 
which sidelined lined him for the 
entire 2017 season.
“That was really one of the 
rougher periods,” he said. “That 
was a roller coaster ride of a 
semester. Luckily, I got through 
it, I recovered very well, and 
I’m back on the ?eld this year. 
Luckily, I had a great group of 
guys and coaches that helped me 
get through that.”

The 2018 Major League Baseball 
free agents include superstars like 
Bryce Harper, Patrick Corbin, 
or Manny Machado. Normally, 
players like those three bounce 
around the top of the league, but 
rumors say that teams that spent 
their time during the 2018 season 
at the bottom could attempt to 
make a big move to increase their 
chances of making it to the post-
season next year.
Like always, the big names 
will take up most of the media 
attention, but following the moves 
of smaller market teams, like the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, is still worth 
doing. Aside from declining Josh 
Harrison’s option, the only other 
move of notice that the Bucs have 
made is their signing of Jung-Ho 
Kang to a one-year contract. That 
move alone gives the Pirates a bit 
more depth on the right side of the 
in?eld, which is one of their most 
glaring needs for 2019, as veteran 
shortstop Jordy Mercer became a 
free agent and rookie Colin Moran 
struggled through the majority of 
his 2018 season at third base.
There’s still more work to do, 
of course. With Gregory Polanco 
out for the ?rst half of the season 
while he recovers from a shoulder 
injury, along with Edgar Santana 
and Chad Kuhl losing the entirety 
of the 2019 season to Tommy John 
surgery, the Pirates have more 
than a few holes in their lineup. 
The glaring one was in the in?eld, 
where rookies Kevin Kramer and 
Kevin Newman look replacement-
level at best in their month with 
the club in September. Neither 
corner in?elder, Moran or Josh 
Bell, showed the power that top 
management expected from them.
The Kang signing helps on the 
left, and Bell likely just fell into a 
bit of a sophomore slump, so the 
concern is not about ?rst base, but 
the middle in?eld is worrisome. 
Adam Frazier may end up ?lling 
a role in right ?eld and on second 
base, but manager Clint Hurdle 
said that he was likely going to 
stick at second base, so a veteran 
signing in someone like Manny 
Machado would ?ll that void and 
more. The Pirates aren’t the kind 
of team to spend so much money 
on one player, so someone like  
Brian Dozier might help out in 
Pittsburgh. His market value isn’t 
going to be too high, especially 
with the top players already 
in this blockbuster free agent 
market, and he could be signed for 
multiple years, supplying a solid 
defense.
Right ?eld is also an interesting 
spot for the Pirates. They could 
take the leap and try to shake 
things up with a vet signing there 
like Matt Joyce, who enjoyed a 
stint with the club in 2016, one 
of the best of his career. Perhaps 
a guy like Hunter Pence from the 
San Francisco Giants would do 
well in the smaller right ?eld at 
PNC Park. In terms of signing more 
players for the out?eld, re-signing 
Corey Dickerson to a multi-year 
deal here might be prudent.
The Yankees have mentioned 
that they’re giving up on the much-
maligned and inconsistent pitcher 
Sonny Gray, and New York has 
dealt the Pirates players like that in 
the past, ones they’ve seen enough 
from and are willing to dump for 
some prospects. Francisco Cervelli 
and Ivan Nova come to mind. 
Trading some assets for a guy with 
that much upside would go a long 
way to solidifying our rotation if 
our other starters goes down. The 
Bucs bullpen looks to be solid, in 
my opinion.
If the Pirates end up doing  
something in free agency, I’ll 
be surprised, but seeing as they 
traded for Chris Archer and Keone 
Kela at the deadline this past 
season, it might be a new leaf for 
the Buccos. After the unloading 
of Andrew McCutchen and Gerrit 
Cole last offseason, we’ll just have 
to wait and see what they end up 
doing. The Pirates might push 
the envelope and try to win this 
season, who knows?
Pirates should look to pillage great free agent market
MICHELLE MADLANSACAY
Pillbox Editor
Greetings from ?rst-time 
Fantasy Football loser and Pillbox 
Editor, Michelle Madlansacay! 
I’m here today to give you all a 
recap of Week 9 for our Tartan 
Fantasy Football League. My 
team, mmichelle123, was the only 
one that moved down in ranking 
this week (which is cool with me), 
while Publisher Caleb Miller kept 
his team, Last Manning Standing, 
in ?rst. Following him are Visual 
Editor Tracy Le’s futbol and 
Assistant Pillbox Editor Izzy Sio’s 
GOAT But Ironically who kept 
their spots in second and third 
place, respectively. Sports Editor 
Marika Yang’s Gin and Bear It 
moved up a spot to seventh place, 
sadly bumping me down to eighth 
and last place.
Aside from my team’s 
misfortune, the past week overall 
has been pretty exciting for our 
Fantasy League.
Last Manning Standing over 
GOAT But Ironically 112.52 to 
92.68
Last Manning Standing now 
has an overall record of 7-2, while 
GOAT But Ironically’s record 
drops to 5-4. New Orleans Saints 
running back Alvin Kamara looks 
like someone to watch out for on 
Last Manning Standing, since 
his leading 29.60 points helped 
bring Miller’s team to victory. 
Miller also had some other play-
ers with abnormally high fantasy 
points this week, like Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers quarterback Ryan 
Fitzpatrick with 24.02 points and 
Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis 
Kelce with 21.90 points.
The losing team, Sio’s GOAT 
But Ironically, unfortunately 
didn’t have nearly as many high 
scoring players this week, with 
only Chiefs quarterback Patrick 
Mahomes scoring above 20 points 
this week with 26.80 points. 
Three other offensive players all 
scored below ten points, and Sio’s 
Baltimore Ravens defense only 
scored one point, contributing to 
her team’s loss this round.
futbol over Slugs 129.98 to 
92.96
In their second matchup 
against Operation Manager Adam 
Tunnard’s Slugs, Le’s futbol yet 
again ?nishes with a win, bringing 
their overall record to 6-3 and 
bumping down Slugs’ record to 
4-5. It was futbol’s Chicago Bears 
defense who really led the team 
to victory this week, scoring 28 
points. Individual players on Le’s 
team put up solid performances, 
with Carolina Panthers 
quarterback Cam Newton scoring 
21.18 points, Julio Jones with 
18.10 points, George Kittle with 
16.80 points, and Nick Chubb 
with 15 points.

Dear Michelle,
The holiday season is approaching, and I’m super 
excited! This has always been my favorite time of 
the year, mainly because my family and I have the 
best traditions. It’s a time when I genuinely feel 
at my happiest. I know that my holiday season 
experience might be a little different because I’m 
in college now, and honestly, I’m sort of worried 
about that. I really don’t want all the stress from 
school to ruin the holiday season for me. I want 
to be able to celebrate the holidays, while also 
finishing off my semester on a good note. Do you 
have any tips on how to do that?
Thanks,
Help On Living In Denial About Year-end Stress
Dear HOLIDAYS,
The holiday season is also my favorite time of the 
year! And I understand that it’s difficult to have 
to find ways to keep up your family traditions and 
feel at home, especially when you’re so far from 
home. But over the past few years I’ve been in 
college, I’ve learned some good ways to do so.
The first thing you can do is make up your own 
traditions with friends! I’m sure during this time of 
the year, a lot of people, including your friends, 
are starting to feel homesick and miss their 
families. Since a lot of you are feeling the same 
way, this would create a good opportunity for 
you guys to find some fun activities to do together 
during your free time; to create spaces where you 
all can spend quality time with one another, and 
be like a family. Something nice you all could do 
is have a potluck dinner, where you all can bring 
dishes that you usually eat with your families 
during the holiday. Not only is this a great way to 
bond with your friends, but you can learn so much 
more about them and their cultural backgrounds. 
Another thing you can do, if you feel like you’re 
missing out on the holiday celebration while being 
on campus, is decorate your dorm! Of course, ask 
your roommate (if you have any) if it’s okay to 
decorate the entire dorm, but it’s so easy to put 
up even a few decorations on your wall or door to 
help spread the holiday cheer.
And while it may not seem like campus is getting 
into the holiday spirit just yet, you can just take 
a twenty minute bus ride downtown this Friday 
for Pittsburgh’s annual Light Up Night event, or 
check out a fully-decorated Phipps Conservatory 
in about a week or two. These two events are all 
about celebrating the holiday season, and you’ll 
get to experience all the decorations, lights, music, 
and even fireworks! It might not be obvious, but 
Pittsburgh really does love the holidays as much as 
you and I do. And while it might be different from 
how you usually celebrate at home, making your 
own holiday traditions with a “second family” in 
Pittsburgh can be a really wonderful thing. It’ll take 
some time to get used to, but hopefully these will 
become experiences you can look forward to in 
your coming years of college. Hope this helps!
Best,
Michelle
Sujay Utkarsh | Assistant Pillbox EditorBrunch Buddies: Fuel and Fuddle
Not actually brunch, but let’s go with it.
For the record, I went to this restaurant at 
midnight, which is technically morning. Thus, this 
does count as brunch.
Anyway, I recently went to Fuel and Fuddle, a 
restaurant that specializes in American comfort 
food. The reason I went so late was because 1.) I 
hadn’t eaten dinner, 2.) I had just been on a bus 
for 12 hours, and 3.) after 11 p.m., Fuel has a late 
night menu where everything on that menu is half 
off. So, a group of friends and I went with the sole 
intention of stuffing ourselves like turkeys.
The location: Fuel and Fuddle is located near 
the corner of Oakland and Forbes Avenue. A 
good way to remember this is that it’s right next 
to Stack’d, a fact that blew my mind as I walked 
there. It’s not too far away from everything in 
Oakland, and it’s located in a fairly busy spot.
The food: We played ourselves and accidentally 
ordered much more food than we anticipated. 
With the low late night prices, it was way too 
tempting to order the entire menu. We ordered 
pork nachos for the whole table, two of my friends 
both got individual orders of the same pulled pork 
sandwich, and I split a cajun chicken sandwich 
and pierogies with my third friend. The fact that 
we finished all of that food is a testament to its 
quality. It had been a while since I’d had good 
pierogies, and Fuel reminded me why I missed it. 
The addition of the adobo sauce, bacon, and sour 
cream only made the experience better. I don’t 
normally enjoy chicken at American restaurants 
because I find it to be too dry or unseasoned 
for my liking, but the cajun chicken at Fuel was 
incredible. Both my friends who ordered the pulled 
pork sandwich really loved their sandwiches, 
although they complained about being stuffed 
after eating half of it. However, the best dish was 
the pork nachos. I salute whoever came up with 
that idea and the people who prepared the dish 
that night.
The vibe: Even at midnight, the restaurant was 
fairly packed, with several patrons enjoying 
the late night drinks and food while watching 
NFL highlights. There was some nice classic 
rock playing in the background to really set the 
mood, and after a particularly long day, we 
were all instantly re-energized as we entered the 
restaurant.
Lit or Nah: I would easily classify Fuel as lit. My 
overall experience was great, and it’s incredibly 
fun to go here with several friends and eat 
as much food as humanly possible for a very 
affordable price. I highly recommend checking out 
Fuel—be it early in the day or late at night.

Dutchman joins this year’s exclusive club of “what on earth did I just 
watch?” The play is centered around two characters, Lula and Clay, who 
interact mostly on a subway for the entirety of the play. Dutchman is one 
of those productions that is hard to talk about without spoiling because 
the story is one long conversation split up by a bizarre dance/party 
sequence in the middle.
There are three kinds of people who watch plays: those who don’t get 
it at all, those who know everything and make fun of the play for being 
predictable, and those who are with the play the whole time and are 
intrigued, even if they don’t fully understand it. Dutchman is one of those 
plays where it’s hard for the audience to fall into the first two categories. 
The snappy dialogue, character beats, and reversals keep the 
audience on their toes. The actors do an incredible job with the 
material. There is a lot of pressure on them to keep the play 
from collapsing in on itself, but they pull it off effortlessly. Their 
chemistry and tension was very entertaining, and they really sold 
the dance sequence that takes place halfway through the play.
It wasn’t until the end that it made sense, that the play is a 
metaphor for interracial relations and black identity in the United 
States. Clay is a representative of the mild-mannered black man, 
while Lula represents the pressure from white society, trying in 
various ways to goad Clay into an intense reaction, such as 
pretending to understand black culture, calling Clay several racial 
slurs, or telling Clay to stop being complacent by trying to fit into 
white culture. 
This article contains spoilers for the School of Drama’s production of Dutchman.

Clay snaps and goes into a thoughtful monologue on how African American 
culture silently represses generations of rage, and if African Americans were 
to act rationally they would just kill all whites to end their oppression. He 
no longer knows whether it’s the silent rage or the repression of that rage 
that takes a greater toll on black identity. It’s a bold statement, one that 
was written decades ago during the Civil Rights era and holds just as much 
significance today. It’s a testament to the writing that this message was 
conveyed in a compelling manner without feeling like it was preaching to a 
choir.
Dutchman is another excellent production from the School of Drama. 
Their selection this year seems to encompass a great variety of socially 
conscious, thematically relevant, and unique plays. I’m excited to see 
what other intriguing productions the School of Drama has in store for 
the rest of the year.

Tisbert Sketch Comedy
cordially invites you to
Let’s Get Hitched
Tisbert Sketch Comedy presented their show Let’s Get Hitched this past weekend in the Cohon Center Studio Theater, and it was 
a hit! One of the best aspects of the show was how the main wedding sketches were intertwined with various absurd and hilarious 
sketches, dealing with topics ranging from losing Santa Claus to epic laser tag battles to church. The audience participation made 
for an entertaining addition to the already amusing performance.
One of the most notable sketches, and one of my personal favorites, had to have been the family photo. This sketch dealt with the 
all too familiar situation of taking a family photo with a little more absurdity added in. The characters portrayed in the scene added 
to the amusement: with a father and a mother (Zivan Vasquez and Katherine Sabel) who fought like crazy, a bored daughter 
(Amber Quinn), an overenthusiastic son (Thomas von Davier), and a very uptight photographer (Grant Seastream), what could go 
wrong?
Another sketch, as mentioned before, dealt with a nonexistent Santa Claus. The two Santa elves (Zivan Vasquez and Katherine 
Sabel) broke the fourth wall and went in search of a worthy audience member to be Santa. After the selection, the audience mem-
ber came down onstage and put on a Santa hat, and the kids filed in one by one. Two kids (Grant Seastream and Amber Quinn) 
had their own problems coming in to see Santa Claus. This posed a particularly sticky situation to the audience member. The end 
was a bizarre twist of events in which the Easter Bunny (Thomas von Davier) crashed the party and the sketch went into mayhem!
The wedding sketches, the center focus of the production, were very well thought out. They commented on some seemingly relatable 
and some very preposterous scenarios. From a dare to object to the wedding, a flower girl eating the petals, and a particularly 
hilarious youth pastor (Zivan Vasquez) officiating the wedding, these sketches had it all. The couple, Cynthia and Doug (Amber 
Quinn and Thomas von Davier), finally got married at the end, after dodging the crazy maid of honor, Kourtney (Katherine Sabel), 
and the silly best man, Dave (Grant Seastream), bringing the show full circle among its crazy scenarios.
Overall, the performance was incredibly enjoyable, brought out lots of laughs and was very charming. Bravo Tisbert!

---------------------------------------------------

I’m always in the mood for trying new 
restaurants, but like everyone, I have 
my favorite spots that I know won’t let 
me down. We need these restaurants — 
places we bring our family when they 
visit, places we always go to with specific 
people, places that fit a certain mood or 
appetite. For me, one of those places is 
Taiwanese Bistro Cafe 33, better known 
as just Cafe 33, which satisfies all of 
those different situations. I’ve taken my 
parents there, I’ve gone there to catch up 
with friends, and it’s my go-to spot for 
consistently good Taiwanese food.
Cafe 33 is in Squirrel Hill, at the 
intersection of Forbes and Shady 
Avenues. Take any 61 bus, and you’ll get 
within a block of the restaurant. After, 
if you miraculously have room in your 
stomach left, walk down Forbes or Murray 
Avenue for Cold Stone or Waffallonia.
Cafe 33 is small, unassuming, and easy 
to miss, but just look next to the large 
Starbucks. Inside, the single room is 
small and casual — nothing fancy. A 
converted laundromat, it only seats forty 
people, so be careful if you’re venturing 
in a busy rush-hour meal time. You’ll 
see a wide variety of patrons, some 
getting an authentic taste of home or 
others trying something new. Many of my 
friends from Taiwan say this is the best 
place in Pittsburgh for Taiwanese food. 
If you’re not sure how Taiwanese cuisine 
is different from Chinese food, this is the 
place to go to see for yourself.
Of course, the star of the place is the 
food. The menu offers so many choices, 
it can be overwhelming: a multitude 
of seafood, chicken, pork, beef, and 
vegetable entrees and select dishes over 
rice, as well as a long list of noodle 
soups. I highly recommend anything on 
the “Over Rice” menu, but my favorite 
is the Fried Chicken Cutlet 
Over Rice ($8.50). The 
chicken is crispy and 
juicy all at once, 
and goes perfectly 
with the side salad 
and hard-boiled tea 
egg. If you’re not in 
the mood for chicken, 
try the Pork Chop ($8.50) 
or Minced Braised Pork ($8), 
both over rice.
On the other side of the menu, 
Cafe 33 has twenty-six 
different noodle and 
noodle soup choices, and 
I can’t say you can go 
wrong with any of them. There 
are the familiar Lo Mein options 
next to the more traditional 
Taiwanese Pan Fried or Chow Fun 
dishes. I’m a fan of the Cafe 33 
Special Thick Noodle Soup ($11), 
which comes with a lot of fish in a 
hearty broth.
Cafe 33 is close to campus and decently 
priced, but most importantly, the food is 
consistently great. The service is simple 
and clinical, but gets the job done. If 
you’re looking to give a new place a try, 
you might soon find this place on your 
own eatery go-to list, just like how it 
crept up on mine.

---------------------------------------------------

Be Here Now by Ram Dass, also formerly known as Dr. Richard Alpert, is more than just a book. This 
story is a guide for those embarking on the inner journey towards home or Om. Whichever you prefer.
This epic shares experience, clinical knowledge, and pop-culture references from today and the past, in 
order to give the reader comprehensive tools to themselves. Nothing more than that; it’s a spiritual tool. 
I sought out this book in a time of intense searching for answers that I always felt I had within myself, 
but didn’t know how to access. I feel as though this book should be essential for every student here at 
Carnegie Mellon, and other college students across the world, because it helped me access my heart 
in a way I hadn’t imagined before. This book is more than a comprehensive look at the journey of Ram 
Dass: it is a look at the unfolding of the ego, and of the Universe always serving as the best guide that 
there can be.
This book is centered around a journey. But not a journey that takes place on the outside towards a 
destination, but a journey within. A journey towards seeing one’s soul, past the ego — a journey of see-
ing oneself in the pureness of love and understanding. The book is divided into three different portions. 
The irst portion of the book outlines Dr. Richard Alpert’s transition into becoming Baba Ram Dass, 
which means “Servant of God.” He talks in detail about his experience teaching psychology at Harvard 
during the psychedelic era in America. He also shares his experience of using these psychedelics to ex-
perience oneness with the Universe and with God. He clariies that this wasn’t enough for him, because 
there was always a come-down; the sensation is nothing but temporary, so eventually he would become 
sober. The second portion is illustrative and contains mantras for the regular joe schmoe to read and 
meditate over. He places an emphasis on meditating over the mantras because “knowledge is eternal 
and with time and patience, all knowledge inds it way to resonate and bring clarity.” The last portion 
of this book is called “A Cookbook For A Sacred Life”. It has a table of contents dedicated to different 
yogic practices, all the way up to sexual energy. This section of the book is my favorite because it has 
quotes supporting each section from a multitude of sources. You’re not getting a one-sided perspective, 
but a universal one.
This book is for practitioners of all faiths. Whether you’re Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, or any 
other, there is something for you within this book. It doesn’t just stop at religion and inding ways to help 
us reach our God (or gods), but it goes above and beyond to not idolize or ostracize any religion. It in-
cludes all the knowledge and spiritual practices of different religions so that the reader is well equipped 
and informed.
If your goal is to read something that will in turn help you to master yourself and the inner journey 
towards home (Om), then Be Here Now by Baba Ram Dass is just the book for you. It’s without a doubt 
the best and most viable option for anyone not necessarily looking to enter a religion or religious prac-
tice, but looking to advance their spiritual practice, whether they are religious or not.

Grande redefines the “break up song” as “thank u, next” radiates positivity and acceptance.
When we hear “break up song,” we tend of think of cheating, wist-
fulness, grief, and Taylor Swift. Most breakup songs are filled with 
pain, some embodying a wave of sadness, and others embodying 
the vengeance and vindication desired from an unfaithful ex (Carrie 
Underwood’s “Before He Cheats,” anyone?). But we rarely hear a 
breakup song about self-acceptance – about what comes after the pain, 
the denial, and the anger. Ariana Grande’s newest single “thank u, 
next” is ushering in a new era of break up songs that celebrate self-love, 
strength, and personal growth.
“thank u, next” was released just months after the release 
of her incredibly successful fourth album, Sweetener. 
While the title of the song may appear petty or 
dismissive, the song is anything but – Grande 
is gracious and kind, thanking her exes 
for teaching her how to be patient, 
how to love, and how to deal with 
pain. While it’s difficult to imagine 
thanking your exes, particularly 
those that bring painful experi-
ences back to mind, Grande 
has taken the difficulty out of 
it. Rather than drone melan-
cholically, she celebrates her 
own personal growth and 
her ability to use those pain-
ful experiences to become a 
kinder, more loving person.
The song is filled with Ariana Grande 
trademarks – floaty vocals, tight harmo-
nies, and bouncy accompanying beat. It is 
happy and celebratory – the kind of song 
you would sing with your best friends in 
your living room after a hard day. It is 
both intimate and vulnerable in its emo-
tion and public with its message 
of personal growth, a bal-
ance that’s often difficult 
to achieve (especially in 
mainstream pop). While 
we might not expect a 
breakup song from Grande, 
we may have expected something 
more somber and ballad-like, especially 
given her recent breakup with ex-fiance Pete Davidson. But “thank u, 
next” is one of few pop songs that’s actually focused on celebrating 
yourself during the period of re-learning after a relationship. The most 
impactful line of the song deals with exactly that: “I met someone else, 
We havin’ better discussions. I know they say I move on too fast, But this 
one gon’ last, ‘Cause her name is Ari, And I’m so good with that.”  The 
past 18 months have been incredibly difficult for Grande considering 
the suicide bombing at her concert in Manchester, her break up with 
Pittsburgh-native rapper Mac Miller and his deeply tragic death, and her 
break up with ex-fiancé Pete Davidson. It’s difficult to imagine how some-
one who’s been through so much at so young an age could be so full of 
love, and yet here she is – emerging stronger than ever by revealing her 
vulnerability and bettering herself from her experiences. It 
is a testament to her true strength – of being able 
to not only move on but to feel empowered 
and loved in her choices and relation-
ships. It is so inspirational and 
astounding to see her bounce 
back and thrive after such peri-
ods of grief. She sings with a 
clear smile in her voice, “I’ve 
got so much love, I’ve got so 
much patience, I’ve learned 
from the pain, I turned out 
amazing. I’ve loved and I’ve lost, but 
that’s not what I see. ‘Cause look what I’ve 
found, there’s no need for searching.”
For the difficult year that much of 
the world has had, it’s almost 
as if Grande knew this is 
what the world needed. 
This song is a message 
of female empowerment 
– it displays incred-
ible presence and self-
awareness while simul-
taneously infecting the 
listener with a fun beat. 
In the face of sadness, 
Ariana Grande’s new 
single is filled with unfet-
tered and almost impossible 
optimism. It is a song that serves 
as a band-aid for the heart, reminding 
the listener that sometimes the process of 
bettering yourself is what’s really important. 
Grande tweeted on Nov. 11, “what an interesting, 
challenging, painful and yet beautiful and exciting chapter 
of life...when it rains it pours but I’m embracing all of it. I’m excited for 
whatever else the universe has in store for me. She’s growing n she’s 
grateful.” As someone who admires and respects her for making the art 
that she did, “I’m so f**kin’ grateful” for this song.

This week, Movies in McConomy will be screening two different thrill rides.
11
The newest installment in the Ocean’s franchise stars Sandra Bullock as Danny Ocean’s sister, and follows her creation 
of a new team to pull off a heist. The film is effectively the same as Ocean’s 11 but lacking a lot of the style of Steven 
Soderbergh’s original. It’s not particularly special, but unlike some other reboots or remakes of franchises, this film has 
respect for its source material. If you want a fun, inoffensive film that will kill some time, I would recommend checking this 
one out. Otherwise, stick to the original Ocean’s 11.
Ocean’s 8
Go watch this. You have no excuse not to if you’re available and want something to watch. It’s playing in the Cohon Center 
and it’s free. This is one of the best big budget action films since Mad Max: Fury Road and maybe one of the best action 
films ever. It’s a great homage to old-time spy action thrillers with several twists and turns. All the characters are fun to watch. 
The story is engaging. Ethan’s character gets some depth for once. They call back to the other films really well. But most 
importantly, the action is just jaw-dropping. This has the best of every kind of action sequence: it has one of the best skydiv-
ing sequences, one of the best fist fights, one of the best car chases, one of the best heists, one of the best foot chases, and, 
of course, the best (and only?) helicopter chase ever filmed. The level of effort that the entire crew, especially Tom Cruise, 
put into this film is incredible, and every other studio needs to take note of this and put in this level of effort and care into 
their own big budget films. If you have nothing to do and are choosing to binge Netflix, close that and go watch this instead. 
You won’t regret it.
