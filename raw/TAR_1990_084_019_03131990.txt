Dining Service, Housing 
announce rate increases
By NICOLE BROCKMANN
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Carnegie Mellon students will 
face a rise in housing and dining 
service costs for the 1990-91 school 
year, according to Director of Hous­
ing Anthony Martin and Director of 
Dining Services James Gurley.
The board rates for Dining Serv­
ices are slated to rise by 9.5 percent 
next year, and housing costs will 
increase by seven percent. Accord­
ing to Gurley, the main impetus for 
the increase is that the first install­
ment of the loan used to establish 
the new dorm and dining facility 
must be paid this year. Gurley esti­
mates that each yearly payment on 
the loan will amount to well over 
$300,000.
Dining rates will increase by 9.5 
percent on each of the four meal 
plans, although the breakfast pe­
riod is the only meal period that 
will see an increase in the cash
allowance. The breakfast allowance 
will rise fifteen cents, from $3.15 to 
$3.30.
According to Gurley, this meal 
period is the one which is most 
underused by students. He said he 
hopes that the raise in the break­
fast cash allowance will encourage 
more students to take advantage of 
this period and help them to get 
more value from their meal plans.

Reaction to
grad school 
ratings mixed
By CARLOS H. FRANCO
Tartan Contributing Editor
Carnegie Mellon’s graduate engineering school 
ranked seventh in the nation and GSIA placed 
thirteenth in a new ranking of graduate schools, 
which will appear in the March 19 issue of U.S. 
News and World Report.
Although neither GSIA Dean Elizabeth Bailey, 
nor CIT Dean Paul Christiano could be reached for. 
comment, others associated with the schools had 
mixed reactions to the ratings. Faculty and stu­
dents associated with CIT seemed pleased — the' 
school moved up one slot from last year’s rankings 
— but those associated with GSIA were upset.
“It’s nice to move up, and in this company it’s; 
hard,” said Civil Engineering professor Richard 
Luthy. “To some extent national rankings depend 
on size. When you consider our size, our ranking 
seems favorable — all the schools in the top ten with 
the exception of the California Institute of Technol­
ogy are larger than us.”
“I am not shocked, surprised, or upset about it. I 
think that for many years we have been ranked 
between fifth and eighth,” said second-year electri­
cal engineeringmaster’s studentTamal Mukherjee.
Last year, when GSIA was ranked 13th by Busi­
ness Week, many grad students expressed concern 
because they felt the school should have been ranked 
higher.
Associate Dean of GSIA Ilker Baybars, who had 
not seen the ranking at press time, would not com­
ment on this year’s ranking.
Some GSIA students, however, were vocal. “It’K 
expected,” said second year master’s student Jay;

City Council considers move to protect gays
By NICOLE BROCKMANN
Tartan Assistant News Editor
In a four-and-a-half hour ses­
sion last Thursday, Pittsburgh’s 
City Council heard testimony on 
a proposed amendment to 
Pittsburgh’s City Code which 
would prohibit discrimination on 
the basis of sexual orientation. 
Over 80 residents of the City of
Pittsburgh and its outlying areas 
spoke at the gay rights hearing.
Asimilaramendmenthadbeen 
defeated by City Council in Octo­
ber of 1988. Most of the current 
Council, however, supports the 
new ordinance. A letter drafted 
by the organization Citizens for 
Pittsburgh, which opposes the 
amendment, was sent to Council 
members who support the legis­
lature — including the amend­
ment’s author, Dan Cohen, who 
represents Carnegie Mellon and 
the rest of District Eight.
A preliminary vote on the issue 
will be taken in committee tomor­
row, and a final vote will take 
place one week from today. Cur­
rently, six council members sup­
port the bill; two oppose it, and 
one has not .yet made clear his
stance.
Sixty area residents who spoke 
at the hearing supported the 
amendment, while the other 
twenty-three who testified voiced 
their opposition to it. Among those 
who testified in support were 
Carnegie Mellon philosophy pro­
fessor Ernie Alieva, SDS depart­
ment head Robyn Dawes, staff 
members Michael Franzini. and
Scott Safier, and students Roy 
Conard and Neil Thornton.
Thornton, who spoke on behalf 
of CMU OUT, presented a poign- : 
ant example of the kind of dis­
crimination which occurs all too 
often to sexual minorities.

Murphy as dean
By SCARLETT TOWNSEND
Tartan Staffuiriter
Michael Murphy was appointed 
dean ofStudent Affairs Tuesday, 
after serving as acting dean for 
nearly nine months.
Murphy’s appointment as act­
ing dean was to last for one year 
after Brad Walters, the previous 
dean, resigned to open a consult- 
ingfirm. According to Vice Presi­
dent for Enrollment William El­
liott, his appointment was neces­
sary to maintain stability so that 
the search did not become the 
focus of the fall semester.
The search for a dean began 
around Thanksgiving when Elli­
ott began a process that included 
eight weeks of meetings with
student groups, faculty, deans, 
and the Student Affairs Commit­
tee of the Trustees. These meet­
ings centered on how the search 
would be conducted.
The search committee consisted 
ofStudentGovemment President 
Mark Mittelhauser, Associate 
Dean of CIT/MCS Bob Kail, As­
sistant Vice Presidentfor Enroll­
ment Sanford Rivers, Associate 
Provost Barbara Lazarus, Chair 
of Faculty Senate Volker 
Hartkopf, Assistant Head of 
MathematicsRussell Walker, and 
Assistant Director for Housing 
andResidence Life Amy Ginther.

search with a concentration on 
internal candidates. After inter­

crumples poster policy
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan News Editor
Leaders of Student Senate say 
that Senate’s own violation of the 
campus postering policy it put into 
effect earlier this semester was 
the unfortunate result of miscom- 
munication among members of 
Senate’s Public Relations Com­
mittee.
According to Senate Chair Chris 
Neighbor, seven posters for a 
Senate Happy Hour were placed 
illegally on the doors of Baker and 
Doherty Halls, as well as the door 
of one unspecified office. Neighbor 
said that the reason the posters 
were placed in violation of the 
policy stemmed from the fact that 
the committee was late in poster-
ing for the event.
Though exactly what tran spired 
remains unclear, Neighbor indi­
cated that someone on the com­
mittee mistakenly assumed that 
it would be acceptable to place the 
signs in areas that were more 
highly visible, despite the fact that 
postering there would violate the 
policy, which allows postering only 
on designated campus bulletin 
'boards.
In a letter of apology to the 
campus sent to The Tartan, Mi­
chael Keleher, chair of Senate’s 
Public Relations Committee, ac­
knowledges that “we made a re­
grettable error in judgement.”

Carnegie Mellon in Brief
University honors outstanding 
faculty members with awards
Carnegie Mellon announced the winners of two of its highest 
awards last Wednesday. Helmut Vogel, associate professor of 
physics, won the William H. and Frances S. Ryan Teaching 
Award, while the Robert Doherty Prize was awarded to two 
Carnegie Mellon faculty members, English professor Erwin 
Steinberg and civil engineering professor Tung (Steve) Au.
Vogel received the Ryan Teaching Award — the University’s 
highest honor for undergraduate teachers — for his unusual de­
votion and effectiveness in teaching undergraduate students. 
Vogel joined Carnegie Mellon’s faculty in 1983, and is now a 
lecturer and director of the University’s introductory physics 
Courses.
Steinberg and Au were chosen to receive the Doherty Prize for 
“their substantial and sustained contributions to excellence in 
-education. Steinbergis the Thomas S. Baker professor of English 
¦and interdisciplinary studies, and is also the former dean of 
“it&SS. Au, a professor of civil engineering and engineering and 
"public policy, has written six textbooks and has been instrumen- 
'' tfil in shaping the University’s engineering curriculum.
CMU grad students add new 
tlimension to video technology
Carnegie Mellon researchers might be responsible for spec­
tacular graphics in future video games and movies, according to 
an article in the March 12 issue of Business Week. Graduate 
students Ping-Kang Hsiung and Robert H. P. Dunn of ECE have 
developed software that graphically simulates how objects might 
look if they traveled through space at nearly the speed of light.
The software combines the fourth dimension —time—and the 
speed of light with light-ray tracing, which is used to simulate 
photography, resulting in animations of objects that appear to 
bend into spectacular geometrical shapes as they travel at 99 
percent of the speed of light.
Entertainment companies have expressed interest in using the 
technology behind the software, which has been copyrighted by 
Carnegie Mellon, for video games, movie special effects, and tele­
vision. Scientific applications may include simulations, lens 
manufacture, and uses in evaluating data from space probes.
H&SS gives students a break 
on Mac II workstations
If you’re in H&SS, owning an Apple computer might now be a 
little easier. Beginning today, students may purchase worksta­
tions in the Macintosh II family configured with the 15-inch 
portrait or 21-inch two-page monitors at a discount of $716 offthe 
regular price. Other hardware options — such as the hard disk 
drive and the amount ofintemal memory—are variable and may 
be designated by the purchasing student under the program.
The H&SS program will run until April 13, and students can 
take advantage of the offer on afirst-come, first-served basis. For 
more information, contact the H&SS Dean’s Office at x2830.
SDC elects executive board
The Student Dormitory Council elected its executive board last 
Wednesday. Junior history major Eric Hamilton, former Eastside 
vice president, will take over as president at tomorrow’s meeting 
at 7 pm in the Wherrett Room. Junior Michael Schwartz was 
elected to succeed Hamilton as Eastside vice president. Sopho­
more physics major John Lakin was elected as Vice President for 
the Hill. Two other area vice presidencies — Mudge/Oakland- 
' Shadyside and Morewood — remain vacant and will probably be 
filled within the next week or two, according to sources.
. Also elected to the executive board were sophomore Meri Tyler, 
~who will serve as SDC secretary, and sophomore Cami Kowash, 
_ who will serve as SDC treasurer. Wong said that the new presi-
- dent will appoint committee heads within three or four weeks.

Iran indicates 
freedom near for 
Western hostages
NICOSIA (AP) — President 
Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran said 
the problem of the Western hos­
tages held in Lebanon will be 
solved.
“My feeling is that the issue of 
the hostages is moving toward a 
solution,” Rafsanjani said.
Rafsanjani also said that Iran 
was not directly linked to the 
hostage issue, but had pledged to 
use Iran’s influence to seek their 
freedom.
He repeated Iran’s demands 
that Western nations help trace 
Iranian hostages missing in Leba­
non and “also reduce their mis­
chievous acts.”
Eighteen Westerners are miss- 
ingin Lebanon, most believedheld 
by Shiite Moslem groups loyal to 
Tehran.
The hostages include eight 
Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, two Swiss, an Irish­
man and an Italian.
Rafsanjani’s statements at a 
press conference followed a series 
of editorials in English-language 
papers in Tehran saying the hos­
tages shouldbefreedbecause they 
were being used as anti-Islamic 
propaganda.
There have also been several 
newspaper reports that the U.S. 
and Iran were negotiating over 
the fate of the hostages, which 
Washington has denied. Raf­
sanjani also said there were no 
talks, according to IRNA, moni­
tored in Nicosia.
West Germany 
calls for respect 
of Polish borders
BONN (DJ)—West Germany’s 
Parliament adopted a resolution 
calling for a united Germany to 
honor Poland’s western border 
after a raucous debate marked by 
charges that Chancellor Helmut
Kohl had endangered the unifica­
tion process.
The resolution states that the 
two Germanys should adopt iden­
tical declarations saying, “The 
Polish people are assured that 
their right to live in secure bor­
ders will not be questioned” by 
Germans through territorial 
claims “either now or in the fu­
ture.”
It further states that the future 
government of a united Germany 
should sign a border treaty on the 
basis of those declarations.
Kohl had come underfire abroad 
as well as in West Germany for 
his previous reluctance to un­
equivocally state that a united 
Germany would never lay claim 
to land ceded to Poland after the 
Third Reich’s defeat at the end of 
World War II.
Kohl, apparently trying to avoid 
offending conservative voters 
before federal elections in Decem­
ber, had insisted that only the 
government of a united Germany 
could address the matter.
Israeli warplanes 
batter Palestinian 
guerrilla base
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli 
warplanes attacked a Palestin­
ian guerrilla base near the north­
ern Lebanese city of Tripoli on 
Friday in the first raid in the re­
gion by the Israelis in nearly five 
years, the Israeli military com­
mand said.
A guerrilla group, the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Pales­
tine-General Command, said six 
Israeli warplanes rocketed one of 
its naval bases, killing two guer­
rillas and wounding a Lebanese 
farmer.
The Israeli military said the 
bases served as “launchingpoints” 
for attacks on Israel by the Pales­
tinian group, which is led by 
Ahmed Jibril.
The military communique said 
all planes returned safely from 
the raid on the Khan el-Khiyat 
area six miles north of Tripoli.
? NATIONAL NEWS
Postage rate 
hike imminent
WASHINGTON (AP) — The 
governors of the U.S. Postal Serv­
ice voted to raise rates, including 
a nickel jump in the cost of mail­
ing a first-class letter, but it may 
be as long as a year before any 
increase takes effect.
The proposal calls for the cost of 
mailing a first-class letter to in­
crease from a quarter to 30 cents, 
with the price for each additional 
ounce rising from 20 cents to 23 
cents. Post cards would cost 20 
cents, also up a nickel, while 
Express Mail would go from $8.75 
to $9.75.
Overall, rates will increase by 
about 19 percent on all types of 
mail.
Frank said the increases are 
needed because the post office 
could face its biggest deficit ever 
this year, between $1.4 billion 
and $1.6 billion.
Th e governors’ vote was the first 
step in a nearly year-long process 
heeded to increase mail rates. The 
proposal must go to the independ­
ent Postal Rate Commission, 
which has 10 months to consider
the request, hold hearings and 
issue a repert.
If the commission agrees, rates 
can increase. If not, it’s back to 
the drawing board unless the 
postal board of governors can 
muster a unanimous vote to over­
rule the commission.
At any rate, an increase will not 
occur before early 1991.
U.S. to consider 
changing Exxon 
plea bargain
SAN FRANCISCO (DJ) — 
Exxon Corp. and the U.S. Justice 
Department will begin talks soon 
on restructuring a plea bargain 
proposal to resolve criminal 
charges related to the Valdez oil 
spill, Alaska officials and others 
close to the situation predicted.
Revival of the talks is expected 
largely because Exxon’s lawyers 
are of the view that the U.S. Jus­
tice Department — contrary to 
the recent assessment of a top 
federal prosecutor — stands a 
strong chance of prevailing in 
court, and because the oil giant 
clearly wants to avoid the pro­
longed and embarrassing public­
ity that such a trial would bring, 
those same individuals add.
Most worrisome, from Exxon’s 
viewpoint, is the fact that it will 
be forced to stand trial before an 
Anchorage, Alaska jury which is 
a mere 100 miles from Prince Wil­
liam Sound. It is here that the 
Exxon Valdez supertanker ran 
aground last March 24, setting 
off America’s largest oil spill. The 
vast, scenic sound is commonly 
known as “the playground of An­
chorage” and is to that city of 
250,000 what the Hamptons are 
to New York.
Legal experts also say the cir­
cumstances of the accident itself 
pose huge monetary risks for 
Exxon should it be convicted. The 
Valdez captain, Joseph Hazel­
wood, is currently on trial in 
Alaskan court for allegedly being 
drunk at the time of the accident.
Bush proposal 
calls for user fees 
to improve transit
WASHINGTON (AP) — A new 
Bush administration policy calls 
for more user fees, toll roads and 
local government help for a trans-
portation system that it says is 
“beginning to break down.”
Its overall goal is to maintain 
the U.S. transportation system 
as “the finest in the world.” 
However, it said “there are in­
creasing signs...that the system 
is beginning to break down.” : 
Anyone looking for a far-reach­
ing program such as the inter­
state highway system begun in 
the Eisenhower administration is 
likely to be disappointed.
The policy statement outlined 
no strategy that would involve 
major federal fundingbeyond that; 
already called for in the,, 
president’s budget.
It proposed that users, includ­
ing airline passengers and motor­
ists, pay more of the cost of build­
ing, maintaining and administer­
ing major transport systems.

University paves road for undergrad projects
By BANDY UDAVCAK
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Tartan News Analysis
Carnegie Mel­
lon places strong 
emphasis on 
research and 
creative projects 
by faculty mem­
bers. Yet research work is often 
far removed from students, and 
has caused considerable contro­
versy over its compatibility with 
the larger theme of education.
New efforts by faculty and 
-administration, however, prom­
ise to bring the two spheres closer 
together by facilitating under­
graduate research programs and 
creative projects. Barbara 
;Lazarus, associate provost for 
academic projects, has been work­
ing under the auspices of the 
Associate Deans’ Council to de­
velop a grant program for under­
graduates interested in doing 
projects that they normally 
couldn’t pursue because of finan­
cial limitations or a lack of facili­
ties.
, The program is essentially a 
coordinating effort for all under­
graduate work at Carnegie Mel­
lon, regardless of department. 
According to Lazarus, the 
program’s purpose is “to provide 
a way to leverage what little time 
students do have in a meaningful 
way to allow them to do some­
thing of their own choosing, ei­
ther in research, or in creative or 
artistic work.” Its aim is to pro­
vide students with the means to 
conduct independent research, 
either alone or under the guid­
ance of a faculty member, in the 
student’s area of interest.
To that end, the Directory 
Committee of the Associate Deans’ 
Council has compiled a guidebook 
entitled the Directory of Oppor­
tunities for Undergraduate Re­
search and Creative Projects. The 
guide is a description ofindepend- 
ent study courses by department, 
as well as a complete listing of 
research and creative project 
areas in which individual faculty 
members are interested. Accord­
ing to Lazarus, faculty response 
has been very positive. “We had 
over one hundred [teachers] the 
first year,” she said.
Lazarus stresses that grant
",Research is a word we often use as a cover term, but 
we’re not simply looking for research projects. ”
— Barbara Lazarus, 
associate provost for academic projects
money is available to students in 
any department, regardless of 
area of interest. Funds may be 
used for a broad array of purposes 
—from equipment costs incurred 
in lab work to art supplies. The 
open-ended n ature of th e program 
allows a variety of different inter­
pretations of what constitutes a 
research or creative project. 
“Research is a word we often use 
as a cover term, but we’re not 
simply looking for research proj­
ects,” she said.
The budget for the program 
earmarks $15,000 each year for 
educational innovation. “We hope 
that this program will grow,” said 
Lazarus, “that every year we will 
have more money so that we’ll be 
able to fund more projects.”
Currently the program involves
10 students rangingfrom a fresh­
man ECE major to a fifth year 
architecture student. “We’ve re­
ally been thrilled by the response 
and the quality of the proposals 
that have come in,” said Lazarus.
“The purpose of this student 
grant program,” said Lazarus, “is 
to say, ‘if you have an idea where 
a little bit of money could make a 
difference, come to us.’ We wish 
we could fund everything, [but] 
we can’t. Maybe over time we’ll be 
able to fund more, but some of our 
students at least will be able to 
take their idea, and money won’t 
stand in their way of their being 
able to do it.”
The idea of undergraduate re­
search is not entirely new, how­
ever, as a few individual depart­
ments already have existing pro­
grams. A particularly large pro­
gram, for example, is that of the
Biology Department.
According to department head 
Susan Henry, undergraduate 
research has “long been a tradi­
tion” in the department. The 
National Science Foundation 
currently grants the department 
$40,000 annually, which is used 
to fund summer research pro­
grams. The department was also 
awarded the sum of $1.2 million 
to be disbursed over the next five 
years from the Howard Hughes 
foundation for undergraduate 
research activities.
Henry said that research op­
portunities are not limited to 
students with high academic 
ranking, and that often, seeing 
the practical application of theo­
ries learned in class actually spurs 
achievement in students of lower 
ranking. Currently, 70 to 75 per­
cent of the department’s under­
graduates are involved in som£ 
type of research activity. “I think 
that other departments could do 
the same,” said Henry.
Lazarus said she envisions 
continued growth in undergradu­
ate research programs, with stu­
dent involvement increasing as 
more funds become available. “I 
would like to see a situation,” she 
said, “where three-quarters of the 
students at Carnegie Mellon were 
involved in undergraduate re­
search or creative artistic work.!’
Aside from funding, the -key 
determinant of research/creative 
programs will be student inter­
est. Lazarus stressed that ; the 
program is designed to deal with 
the students’ coursework and 
interests and not add to existing 
work. Given the tight schedules 
of many students, time is a factor 
of prime importance. But given 
proper coordination with a 
student’s curriculum and contin­
ued support from the administra­
tion, the program could bring 
about a closer connection between 
the research and academic inter­
ests of the University.
Eirene claims SEI in 
disarray, engaged in 
weapons research
By JAMES B. ENDRES
Tartan Contributing Editor
SEI protestor Vincent Eirene staged 
an informal press conference in Grey 
Matter on Wednesday, February 28, 
distributing pamphlets entitled “Tear 
Down the Wall of Hate” and erecting a 
ten-foot wall of cardboard boxes that he 
said symbolized “the wall ofhate” around 
Carnegie Mellon.
Although Eirene claimed at his press 
conference that the Software Engineer­
ing Institute is in “internal disarray” 
and that Professor Steven Fenves is 
working on abattle-management expert 
system, both SEI director Larry Druffel 
and Fenves deny the respective charges.
“There’s a crisis at SEI,” Eirene said, 
citing an SEI strategic planning docu­
ment and memo datedFebruary26,1990' 
from SEI director Larry Druffel.
The document, which is marked as an 
internal document not intended for dis­
tribution outside the institute, shows 
“internal disarray at the SEI,” according 
to Eirene. The leaflets that Eirene dis­
tributed at the event included excerpts 
from the document and memo. SEI 
spokesman Terry McGillen provided The 
Tartan with a copy of the original docu­
ment.
Eirene claimed that th e excerpts of the 
memo he provided in the pamphlet indi­
cate a possible re-organization of SEI 
and a re-thinking of its mission.
“It was an internal document,” Druffel 
said. “The reason it was labelled ‘not to 
be distributed outside of the SEI’ is be­
cause it was an early draft of strategic 
planning. Organizations normally do that 
sort of thing.”
In the memo, Druffel writes, “I am well 
aware that we could improve our organ­
izational structure.”
But Druffel denies Eirene’s claims. 
“Actually, [the memo] specifically said 
we were not going to have a re-organiza- 
tion,” Druffel said. “It said we were going 
to address some strategic planning is­
sues.”
“We are currently addressing a collec­
tion of client needs,” Eirene excerpted 
the document as saying. “These needs 
have been identified in an ad hoc man­
ner. During the next phase of planning, 
we must define those needs in a more 
disciplined fashion, including evaluation 
of evidence that such needs exist....” 
“There has been discussion around the 
Institute about whether we should re­
organize along different technology 
lines,” Druffel told The Tartan, “and my 
memo simply said that I realize that we

need to do that, but I didn’t think that’s 
the most important thing right now.” 
“Ayear ago we... showed that SEI was 
working on eleven nuclear weapons sys­
tems, even though they said they were 
not,” Eirene said. “This is more evidence 
that in fact they are working on different 
weapons systems. SEI is the very central 
core and hub of enhancing the software 
of our nuclear military.”
“SEI is going through turmoil,” Eirene 
said. “They’re trying to justify their exis­
tence. It’s very hard to build weapons 
systems when you don’t have an enemy,” 
said Eirene, referring to recent changes 
in countries traditionally regarded as 
Cold War enemies.
“Certainly the Cold War is winding 
down,” said Druffel. “I’m sure the De­
partment of Defense will eventually draw 
down so that we have less of a standing 
force.... Fifty years ago we could react to

Druffel said. “Now we have to have de­
fensive systems just in case. So I’m sure 
the Defense Department will continue to 
exist, will continue to develop new sys­
tems and will continue to maintain the 
systems that they have. And that im­
plies that they’re going to be using a 
significant amount of software.”

contract renewed, and Druffel denied 
that the SEI was feeling or anticipating 
budget cuts because of Defense Depart-

The Macintosh User’s Group 
has returned this weekafter being 
denied their Special Allocation 
last week for the Ruby Stardrive 
150 TX and additional backup 
software. They posed a list of al­
ternatives to this system. Back­

"2/16 INDE­
CENT EXPO­
SURE, 8:34 pm. A 
Campus Police of­
ficer observed two 
men, one wearing 
white boxer shorts with Greek 
letters, near the Skibo parking 
lot entrance. According to the 
officer, the men were posing as 
though they were in a bodybuild­
ing contest. The officer report­
edly saw the man wearing boxers 
remove his penis from his shorts 
andmasturbate, facing oncoming 
eastbound traffic on Forbes Ave­
nue. The two men then crossed 
Forbes together and entered the 
Beta Theta Pi house. The officer 
wss joined by another officer and 
together they entered the Beta 
house to search for the man in the 
boxers. The first officer saw a 
person in the lobby fitting the 
description of the man he had 
seen, and after some confusion, 
he was issued an internal citation 
f0r indecent exposure.
12/18 ASSAULT, 1:11 am. A 
cAll was received by Campus 
Police that a fight was in progress 
at the Beta Theta Pi house. No 
fight was in progress when CMU 
officers arrived; two people who 
w£re standing outside the Beta 
h(mse both said that no fight oc­
curred. Soon after in Skibo, a 
young female Pitt student told a 
Campus Police officer that she 
was just punched in the face by 
someone at the Beta house, but 
she refused to give her name. Her 
description of the person who 
struck her fit the description of 
one of the two men standing at 
the entrance of Beta. The woman 
later called Campus Police stat­
ing that she would sue the Beta 
fraternity. She was informed that 
to; do so requires contacting a 
magistrate. She decided to file a 
report with Pitt Police.
2/18 VIOLATION OF LIQ­
UOR LAWS, 1:19 am. A Campus 
Police officer observed a male 
CamegieMellon student stagger­
ing, falling, and yelling profani­
ties outside of Pi Kappa Alpha. 
The officer checked the student’s 
ID and found him to be underage 
for the consumption of alcohol. 
The student admitted to drink­
ing. As the officer tried to escort 
him home, he became belligerent 
and directed profanity toward the 
officer. The student was issued 
three internal citations.
2/21 INDECENT EXPO­
SURE/DISORDERLY CON-
this allocation last week. The 
group does have a need for a 
backup device. Amotion was made 
to call the question of giving the 
group the $1200. There was one 
objection. The vote was 5—10—4: 
motion failed. A motion was then 
made to allocate $1100 for Magic 
Tape 150, necessary software, and 
shipping and handling charges. A 
rider was attached stating that 
the Mac User’s Group would talk 
to other user groups to see if they 
could combine use and costs. This 
motion passed: 10-4-^i.

Crime and Incident Report
DUCT, 4:42 pm. While observing 
about forty Alpha Tau Omega 
brothers allegedly engaged in a 
pledge ritual called “Repa,” in 
which the pledges run across the 
ATO patio and strike a brick wall 
with a wooden paddle, a Campus 
Police officer witnessed a man 
whom he assumed was a pledge 
remove all of his clothes, in full 
view of the traffic on Forbes Ave­
nue, andrun across the ATO patio 
naked. After strikingthe wall with 
his paddle, the exhibitionist 
jumped the wall onto the More- 
wood Avenue sidewalk, passing 
motorists and pedestrians. He 
then ran back onto the ATO patio 
and disappeared in the crowd. 
Since the identity of the exposed 
person could not be determined, 
ATO President Mike O’Toole was 
issued an internal citation for 
indecent exposure. Assistant 
Dean of Student Affairs Ron 
Campana joined several officers 
to assist in the investigation. In a 
related report, an employee of the 
Hunt Institute for Botanical 
Documentation complained to 
Campus Police about another 
incident involvingpeople from the 
ATO patio, claiming that while 
he was stopped at the traffic light 
next to ATO, a young white man, 
clad only in a jock strap, left the 
ATO patio and placed his bare 
buttocks towards or against the 
side windows of vehicles stopped 
at the light.
2/21 FIREARMS VIOLA­
TION, 9:04 pm. A Campus Police 
officer observed a man on the 
second floor patio of the Kappa 
Sigma house shooting an air rifle 
or other type of long-barreled gun. 
The man had been shooting in 
various directions, and several 
dozen discharges were heard be­
fore he went back inside. An offi­
cer arrived to assist and both offi­
cers entered Kappa Sigma. The 
social chairman of Kappa Sigma 
met the officers at the door and 
accompanied them to the room in 
which the gunman was suspected 
to be. The room was open but 
unoccupied. One of the room’s 
occupants arrived, but he did not 
match the description of the 
gunman. He refused consent of a 
room search on the advice of the 
social chairman. According to 
those present, the patio is consid­
ered a public area.
2/23 LOST OR STOLEN 
PROPERTY, 3:36 pm. A repre­
sentative of the College of Hu­
manities and Social Sciences
for the two PSFB senator seats. 
Sen. Spivack was nominated and 
accepted. Sen. Loomis was nomi­
nated and accepted. Sen. 
Kaufman was nominated and 
accepted. Sen. Lenga was nomi­
nated and declined. Right before 
moving into a secret vote, a mem­
ber of the audience requested that 
the vote be a hand vote. A motion 
was made to have a roll call vote. 
It was pointed out that having a 
secret ballot .vote kept the peace 
internally between senators. The 
motion failed: 3—14—3. Spivack 
and Kaufman were voted as the 
two senators to be on PSFB.
Points of Discussion: About 
the backup drive, some people 
need to “chill out” a little bit when 
talking to outside groups who are 
coming before Senate. About the 
open vote for PSFB, some people 
think that the campus has the 
right to know how their senators 
vote. The question was raised 
about possibly puttingmore pres­
sure on the University to finan­
cially support athletic clubs so 
that they don’t rely so heavily on 
the activities fee for funding. 
Someone also pointed out that 
having a vacancy in the Campus 
Affairs chair is a serious problem.
Announcements: Amnesty 
meetings areevery Wednesday in 
the Amnesty House, MMA133, at 
9 pm. PSFB is meeting on Sunday 
at 2 pm in the Amnesty House.
The meeting adjourned at ap­
proximately 8 pm.
reported that on 9/26/89, four 
manuals entitled Fourth Dimen­
sion were purchased through 
Acius Inc., of Cupertino, CA, and 
were shipped to Carnegie Mellon’s 
Central Receiving via UPS Next 
Day Air. A notice was sent to 
Receiving making them aware of 
the arrival. The employee did not 
receive the manuals, and Receiv­
ing stated that they received the 
notice but not the manuals. A 
check with Acius Inc., found that 
the manuals were shipped on 9/ 
26/89 through UPS. A check with 
UPS found that the manuals were 
signed for by an R. Stapes (spell­
ing unknown). The location and 
date signed are unknown through 
UPS. Several checks of Carnegie 
Mellon Faculty/Staff Directory 
and the C-Book for R. Stapes 
proved negative.
2/24 FIRE ALARM, 6:09 pm. 
CampusPoliceandthe Pittsburgh 
Bureau of Fire responded to a 
tripped fire alarm in Welch Hall. 
The Campus Police officer who 
responded to the alarm found an 
activated smoke detector in a room 
on the second floor, where the 
residents had burned some pizza, 
which set off the detector.
2/25 THEFT, before 11:30 am. 
Unknown persons entered the 
Theta Xi kitchen overnight and 
removed the following items from 
an unlocked freezer: 25 pounds of 
stew meat, 57 pork chops, 1 box of 
stuffed chicken breast, 1/2 box of 
chicken thighs, 1/2 box of chicken 
drumsticks, and 5 pounds of pork.
2/28 LEWD WRITING, re­
ported 2:49 am. While patrolling 
the Cut, a Campus Police officer 
noticed some writing on the Fence 
that read, “You don’t have to feel 
good to suck cock right.” Accord­
ing to Campus Police, the fence 
markings indicated the ATO fra­
ternity.
3/1 ASSIST OUTSIDE 
AGENCY/WARRANT, 1:08 pm. 
Two State of Pennsylvania con­
stables informed Campus Police 
that they had a warrant for the 
arrest of a Carnegie Mellon stu­
dent. The warrant was issued by 
Magistrate Robert E. Tucker 
stemmingfrom charges filed on 2/ 
4/90 for simple assault and har­
assment. A CMU sergeant and a 
CMU investigator found the stu­
dent inside his Morewood Gar­
dens room at 1:44 pm and ar­
rested him. He was transported 
to Campus Police headquarters 
and given to the custody of the 
constables.

Tartan Assistant News Editor
Reaction to last month’s van­
dalism of a computer lab has 
raised the possibility of locking 
and alarmingthe undergraduate 
laboratories in the ECE depart­
ment after business hours. Con­
flict arises due to the heavy stu­
dent reliance on lab free time to 
complete class assignments.
Vandals kicked in the door to 
Hammerschlag A-104, an event 
which junior ECE major Martin 
Greenberg sees as the last straw 
to a recurring problem. “In the re- 
recent past, there have been scat­
tered incidents of vandalism and 
theft — equipment taken, bro­
ken, and what not,” he said. With 
the vandalism to the door, the 
administration “felt that they
needed more stringent rules re­
garding the use of the labs.”
The ECE administration’s ini­
tial reaction, according to a pro­
posal of protest made by students 
who rely on the labs, was to cur­
tail this free access by locking the 
labs outside of the weekday hours 
of 8 am to 9 pm and to arm the 
existing alarm system.
Juniors Ethan Evans and Mat­
thew Sorrels drafted the proposal 
directed toward avoiding what 
they and many other students 
who rely on the labs feel would be 
an unacceptable solution to the 
concerns over vandalism and 
theft.
Their proposed alternatives 
include the installation of card 
readers that record those who 
enter the labs, around the clock

3/4 UNAUTHORIZED AC­
CESS, 2:00 pm. A security guard 
radioed that a man was standing 
on the bleachers in the construc­
tion site. He was confronted by 
Campus Police units as he was 
leaving the area. The man was 
identified as a CMU student. He 
stated that he was taking pic­
tures of the new dorm to aid a 
current classroom project. He also 
stated that he was unaware that 
he was forbidden to enter the 
construction site since no signs 
and no barriers bar his entry into 
the project site. An officer verified 
the lack of signs and barriers. 
According to the police report, the 
student was very cooperative and 
apologetic, and he stated that he 
didn’t mean to cause a problem. 
The student was issued an inter­
nal citation at the request of a 
CMU Sergeant for his entry into 
the restricted area, as required 
by a departmental directive.
3/5 ASSAULT, 4:48 pm. In a 
meeting between a manager of 
Kiltie Café and a Kiltie Café 
employee, the manager was dis­
cussing the employee’s job per­
formance and termination when 
the employee became irate, threw 
a glass of water on the manager, 
and left. A few minutes later, the 
manager encountered the em­
ployee in the dining area when 
the employee threw his clothes at 
the manager and struck him on 
the side of the head. The clothes 
contained a lock from the locker 
room which made a brush burn 
on the side of the manager’s head. 
The employee then asked the 
manager if he would like to step 
outside, and the manager said no 
and asked the employee to leave, 
which he did. The manager re­
fused medical attention.
3/6 DOG BITE, 1:16 pm. While 
walking outside of Salads Plus, a 
CMU studentencounteredawhite 
shepherd/labrador mix female 
dog, which was restrained by a 
leash. The student reached down 
with his hand to pet the dog, but 
the dog leapt and bit him on the 
inside of his left thigh, causing 
two puncture wounds and rip­
ping his jeans. The student re­
fused transport to the hospital 
but indicated that he would visit 
the Health Center. The dog’s 
handler, a part-time CMU stu­
dent, stated that the dog, whose 
name was “Nikki,” was properly 
licensed and had all current shots.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 13 March 19905,
Officials dispel rumors of 
extraordinary academic 
problems for freshmen
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan News Editor
University officials deny rumors that 
an unusually high number of students in 
the freshman class — as many as 40 
percent — are on academic probation.
In fact, according to Dean of Student 
Affairs Michael Murphy, the actual 
number of students on probation is near 
13 percent. Murphy says that the num­
ber of students on probation, broken down 
by college are: 15 percent in MCS, 14 
percent in CIT, 13 percent in CFA, and
12 percent in H&SS.
“There is a sense that this is consistent 
with previous years,” Murphy said. 
“There is no concern that the rate is 
unusually high.”
Murphy was prompted to look into the 
number of students on probation in each 
college, he said, by several inquiries he 
received about an allegedly high proba­
tion rate. He said that the rumor seemed 
to gain credibility after the publication 
of a column by Michael Drout that ap­
peared in The Tartan’s Forum section 
two weeks ago.
Robert Kail, associate dean of both 
CIT and MCS, acts an advisor for under­
graduates, especially freshmen, in both 
colleges. “I wasn’t disturbed that the 
numbers this year were different than in 
previous years,” he said. “They were 
normal for a fall semester.”
Kail says that in a typical fall semes­
ter, the percentage of freshmen on pro­
bation will fall anywhere between nine 
and fifteen percent.
The number of freshmen expected to 
be on probation after the spring semes­
ter is lower—usually between three and 
nine percent.
Kail says that most of the freshmen 
who are on probation after the fall se­
mester usually raise their quality point 
averages high enough to escape suspen­
sion.
Only three to seven percent of CIT and
MCS freshmen, he says, are unable to 
return to the University at the start of 
what would be the fall semester of their 
sophomore year.
According to University regulations, 
freshmen whose QPAs are below 1.75 
are put on probation. If their QPA is not 
brought above that level for the follow­
ing semester, they are suspended for one 
year.
After the freshman year, any student 
whose QPA falls below 2.0 is placed on 
probation, and ultimately suspension if 
it is not raised above that level in that 
semester.
According to Murphy, each college 
makes an effort to talk to students who 
are placed on probation to help them 
raise their grades.
But Murphy says that being on proba­
tion can be mean different things for dif­
ferent students. “Students who have not 
declared their major often move toward 
courses they did well in and steer away 
from those in which they did poorly,” he 
said.
Kail says thathe tries to help students 
before the problem gets so serious that 
they must be put on probation. “We start 
the process by looking at students’ mid­
semester grades,” he said. “We look at 
the grades of all students — not just 
freshmen — and we request a meeting if 
there is trouble brewing. Unfortunately, 
not all of them come in [to discuss their 
problems.]”
Kail agrees with Murphy in that stu­
dents’ problems tend to be as diverse as 
their backgrounds. “We try to figure out 
what the source of their problems are,” 
he said. “Some of them are just playing 
around; others don’t know how to study.” 
Kail said that frequently things like 
tutoring and counselinghelp students to 
recover.
But those things are not always neces­
sary, he says. “Often the shock of the 
grades pushes freshmen into doingthings 
better.”
A presidential affair...
President Richard Cyert chats with two guests at the President’s Party on March 3. Highlighted by a tribute to “The Cyert 
Years," the event took over most of Skibo, and according to Director of Special Events Maryann Moore, over 650 faculty and 
exempt staff members attended the event. Tickets cost S20.
Eirene claims SEI in internal disarray, 
protests Defense Department connections
Students protest lab policy

staffing, and an improved alarm system.
Evans and Sorrels acknowledge the 
imperfections in both expense and effec­
tiveness. They point out, however, that 
in light of the need for free lab time, their 
alternatives would provide the same 
protection from vandalism as an alarm.
A number of students met with ECE 
Head Steven Director to submit the 
proposal and discuss the various options. 
“[Director] said they were good propos­
als and placed them on his desk,” said 
Evans. “Then, in typical administrative 
fashion, ushered us out the door.”
Junior Barry Brummit, an ECE/phys- 
ics major, sees the situation as a Catch-
22. “Director’s argument involves pro­
tecting education by protecting the equip­
ment,” he says. “But then we’ll have the 
equipment yet wewon’t be able to use it.”
ECE has postponed action on the most 
heavily used lab, and Director could not 
be reached for comment.
Zary Segall is an associate professor 
who teaches Concurrency and Real-Time 
Systems, a class dependent on out of 
class lab work. “I am very proud of the 
students, they have a very responsible 
attitude in that they are willing to work 
with the faculty,” said Segall. “They 
understand the need to protect the equip­
ment from vandalism as well as the need 
for free access to the labs.”

ment cutbacks. “In fact, we got a budget 
increase in our new contract,” Druffel 
pointed out. “So it wasn’t in reaction to 
any [budget considerations] that the 
strategic planning document was cre­
ated. We’ve done this several times in 
the past, and we’ll do it again in the 
future. [Eirene] seemed to have picked 
up the document and said ‘look here, 
they’re in disarray.’ This had nothing to 
do with any developments in Eastern 
Europe or anything like that. It’s just a 
natural part of our activity.”
“As far as I’m concerned,” said Druffel, 
“there’s no news other than the fact that 
Vince is tryingto create news. There’s no 
change in our mission, but at every 
opportunity he likes to complain about 
the SEI.”
Eirene claimed to reveal another, non- 
SEI project that he says is military in 
nature. “The most disturbing informa­
tion of all is that we are linking up with 
people at the University of Massachu­
setts,” he said. “We are not linking arms 
to help out with the homeless, or take for 
those who are disabled or those who are 
poor. It’s not for medical research. We 
are linking computers so that we can 
work on military research in a more 
efficient way.”
Eirene told The Tartan that civil engi­
neering professor Steven Fenves and a 
professor from the University of Massa­
chusetts were involved in research in a 
battle-management expert system.
“This is another igno­
rable event.”
— Larry Druffel, 
SEI director
Fenves expressed surprise at the 
charge. “Computer-based design of auto­
mobiles and chairs, yes,” Fenves told 
The Tartan, “but not warfare.” Fenves 
said that he is working on what Eirene 
cited in his pamphlet as “Feasibility 
Study of a Knowledge-based Expert 
System Finite Element Modeling and 
Analysis.” According to Fenves, the proj­
ect was originally funded by the Defense 
Department, but that contract expired.
“That was a one-year project,” said 
Fenves. “I was not re-funded for a second 
year, and I have continued working on 
the subject with other funding. But I 
have no idea where he made that connec­
tion. Finite-element modeling is involved 
with the design of every building, car, 
any structural or mechanical object in 
which stresses and deflections have to be 
calculated as part of the design process.”
Eirene also cited a proposal for a 
“Centerfor Research on Intelligent, Real­
time Computation in Complex Systems 
that links UMass and SEI and has mili­
tary applications,” in the same section in 
which he writes about Fenves. Fenves 
says he has no knowledge of the project.
Eirene called for action from the Car­
negie Mellon community. “What we need 
to do is to find out first of all what are the,., 
military contracts here on campus,” he„ 
said. “If we’re not informed, then there’s 
no way that we can act. Right now SEI 
has won a new five-year contract. It is- 
going through a reorganization, and you 
as students, you as faculty, and you as~ 
citizens are left out of that process. And;;; 
as you know, it’s hell to be left out.” 
“[Eirene] is a professional protestor,” 
Druffel said, “and has since the begin­
ning of the SEI charged a number oF- 
things that are just not true — that we-' 
are part of the nuclear arms race, that*' 
we’re part of Star Wars — anything that' ¦ 
will get attention, he’s claimed. Our busi­
ness quite simply is to transition soft-” 
ware technology into practice in support'1 
of defense systems. There’s no secret 
about that.”
Eirene is affiliated with Duncan and 
Porter House, a North Side organization 
that takes in and cares for homeless 
people. “A lot of people say I hate Carne­
gie Mellon University and they’re right,” 
Eirene concl uded. “But I love the people."
“Pie can say whatever he wants, 
Druffel said. “I’m happy, and I always ' 
have been, to discuss issues associated- 
with the SEI with the University com*** 
munity. But I’m not willing to respond to' • 
flyers that somebody decides to propau" 
gate around the University. I’ve gotten?1? 
so used to that, that I just ignore him““ 
This is another ignorable event.”

Committee installs Murphy as dean of Student Affairs
continued from page 1
said Mittelhauser, “and not only has he 
changed the direction of the Division, he 
has also made it much more accessible to 
the student body. His permanent ap­
pointment by the committee is a vote of 
support and confidence in what he’s ac­
complished to this point as acting dean.” 
Elliott is confident in Murphy’s ability 
to continue doing a good job as the Dean 
of Student Affairs. He feels that Murphy 
will maintain the standards he has as 
acting dean'. “I wish him the best of luck,” 
he said. “I think we all have to pull 
together to continue to do the things this 
university is capable of to improve the 
quality of student life.”
One of Murphy’s objectives as dean is 
to develop and implement a broad-based 
co-curricular educational program. “We

things this university is capable of to improve

vice president for Enrollment
need to be committed to the non-aca- 
demic as well as academic lives of the 
students,” said Murphy.
Murphy’s philosophy on student life is 
more active than traditional ones. “We 
use a wellness model that covers eight 
dimensions of the student life,” he said.
These dimensions are the social, occupa­
tional, spiritual, sexual, physical, cul­
tural, emotional, and intellectual facets 
of student life.
“I don’t think traditional models would 
really work at this university,” said 
Murphy. “This is ahighly selective, highly
rigorous institution and the capabilities 
and the potentials of the students are so 
high. Much of what I see us doing is 
providing the opportunities for students 
to grow and mature in these eight differ­
ent areas. I’ve spoken to faculty, alumni, 
and trustees, and they would like to be 
involved in the non-academic lives of the 
students. We need to create opportuni­
ties to make this interaction possible.” 
Although Murphy says that much has 
been done to improve student life, he 
said, “There is a lot that needs to be 
done, but I am extremely optimistic.” 
“For example,” he said, “I have many 
strong opinions about the fraternities. I 
think that the Greek system really gets 
beat up. There is this Animal House 
stereotype which detracts from so much 
of what the Greeks do. We need to sup­
port the Greeks — especially the sorori­
ties, who are often overlooked — and 
help them build the kinds of communi­
ties they want. We can help with leader? 
ship and their philanthropic projects.”
Murphy began his career at Carnegie 
Mellon in 1982 as an area coordinator for 
the Hill Dorms. He lived in Donner Hall 
for three years before moving to Mudge1 
House in 1985 when he became the assis­
tant director of housing for residence: 
life. In 1988 he accepted the position of 
student ombudsman and coordinator o'f> 
special projects, before becoming the act-» 
ing dean of Student Affairs in 1989.
Murphy enjoys Carnegie Mellon and- 
hopes to have a long career here. “I plan 
to be here for a long time,” he said. “This 
is a special place with a unique blend of 
people. There is no place like it.”
Dining Service, Housing announce rate increases for next year
continued from page 1
especially the fact that the mini­
mum wage in Pennsylvania has 
been raised twice in the past year, 
as a factor in the decision to hike 
rates. Given the large number of 
people employed by CMDS, even 
a ten-cent rise in the minimum 
wage represents a substantial 
amount of money which will go 
towards employees’ salaries. Next 
April’s likely increase of 45 cents 
per hour will have a significant 
effect on the amount of money 
CMDS will need to expend in 
salaries, said Gurley.
This increase follows a 1989-90 
Dining Service rate increase of 
nearly ten percent. In an inter­
view with The Tartan in March of 
1989, Gurley attributed the 1989- 
90 increase to rising labor costs, a

curred between Keleher and Sena­
tor Chris Warner, who Neighbor 
said actually posted the signs. 
Neighbor said he was unsure as to 
exactly how Warner was led to 
believe it acceptable to violate the 
policy.
Warner was unavailable for 
comment.
Neighbor said thathe spoke with 
both senators about the violation, 
and feels confident that no similar 
incidents will occur. “I told them 
that if they postered like that again, 
it would be ‘over my dead body,’ ” he 
said.
Student Government President 
Mark Mittelhauser said that the 
incident was unfortunate.
He also said that it may indicate 
that members of Senate are not 
fully aware of the implications of 
the decisions that they make as a 
legislative body.
Mittelhauser said that Senators 
probably should devote more effort 
to understanding legislation that 
the Senate considers.
slightly longer academic year, and 
a change in where and what stu­
dents chose to eat. More students 
were choosing an a-la-carte style 
of dining over Kiltie’s all-you-can- 
eat system.
Gurley hopes that an additional 
two hundred students will opt for 
contract meal plans next year as 
a result of the availability and 
convenience of the new residence 
hall and dining facilities. He 
realizes, though, that the higher 
board rates may deter students 
from purchasing meal plans.
“We understand that if you 
raise prices this high, you’re 
bound to have people opt not to 
get on a meal plan,” he says.
He feels, however, that the 
attractiveness of the new dining 
facilities, including the planned
Skibo “food court,” will help keep 
students from dropping their meal 
plans and may entice students 
who are not currently on a meal 
plan to try the contract system.
Like Gurley, Martin attributes 
the housing rate increase to the 
cost of the new residence hall. 
According to Martin, the process 
of developing the housing rates 
begins early in the academic year 
with meetings of SDC’s Housing 
Committee to evaluate the cur­
rent year’s budget and to project 
expenses for the upcoming year.
Martin says that the estima­
tion of a seven percent increase is 
accurate, though the exact 
amount will vary slightly accord­
ing to the type of room.
Martin also points out that the 
housing system has to be com-
“We understand that if you raise 
prices this high, you’re bound to have 
people opt not to get on a meal plan.”
— James Gurley, 
director of Dining Service
pletely self-sufficient; the room 
rates are the only source of in­
come and must cover all expenses 
of the system.
Something that most students 
don’t realize, according to Mar­
tin, is that CMU is still paying 
mortgages on most of the resi­
dence halls on campus, including 
Doherty Apartments, Morewood 
Gardens, and Mudge House.
Student reaction to the in­
creases is mixed. Diane Leland, a 
junior IS major, says that the 
higher DiningServices rates won’t 
really affect her, but the higher 
housing rates will. However, she 
says she will choose to remain on 
campus for convenience.
Sophomore mechanical engi­
neering major Joseph Sanders, 
on the other hand, plans to drop
his meal contract and switch to 
Validine because of the high 
prices. He feels that CMU is “rip­
ping off” students by raising 
prices as a consequence of the 
construction of the new dorm.
Will rates for housing and Dirh 
ing Services go up again next 
year? Probably yes, say both 
Martin and Gurley. Gurley pre­
dicts that Dining Service rates 
are likely to increase about seven 
percent for the next few years; 
this year’s increase is a little 
steeper than the probable in­
creases to come.
“I think that room rates are 
going to go up every year into the. 
foreseeable future,” says Martin. 
“It’s likely to assume we’ll see 
increases in the five or six per­
cent range for the nextfewyears.”

Reaction to grad school ratings mixed on campus
continued from page 1
get the administration to address, but 
we don’t see much being done.”
Baybars responded to last year’s Busi­
ness Week ranking with a position paper 
that criticized the magazine’s methodol­
ogy. In the paper, Baybars made the 
same point as Luthy — that national 
rankings depend on size.
Vice President for Public Relations Don 
Hale agrees. “We have one of the small­
est business schools in the country,” he 
said. “If size is a factor, we won’t do that 
well.”
Baybars felt last year’s ranking would
affect the school’s applications minimally.
However, many current graduate stu­
dents said that they considered rankings 
when they were applying to graduate 
schools. Although second year master’s 
student George Hansen wouldn’t com­
ment on the ranking, he did say that he 
felt that rankings played “a major role in 
people’s decisions.”
Marc Roston, a junior economics stu­
dent considering graduate business 
school, seemed to agree with the asser­
tion that rankings make a difference. 
“My feeling is I would go to graduate 
school if I got into a school that is ranked
in the top five,” he said.
The engineering survey considered 
many key attributes. Student selectivity 
included acceptance and attendance 
rates.
Instructional resources were rated 
based on the number of full-time faculty 
who had doctorates, the ratio of fall-time 
doctoral candidates and master’s stu­
dents to full-time faculty, and, on the 
theory that larger programs have better 
overall resources, the number of doctor­
ates awarded in the last school year.
U.S. News used the total dollar value 
of research that was carried out at the
schools to rate research.
To rate reputation, U.S. News asked 
two top officials at every school to put 
each graduate or professional school in 
quartiles based on the program’s “repu­
tation for academic quality.” Addition­
ally, a cross section of practicing engi­
neers was asked to choose 15 schools 
with the best reputations for producing 
outstanding professionals.
The first attribute for the business 
school survey was student selectivity.
Four variables were considered in 
evaluating placement, including employ­
ment rates, ratio of recruiters to stu­
dents, and starting salaries.
Graduation rate — the number of full 
time students earning MB As in two years
— is the third key attribute.
The last attribute, academic reputa­
tion, was computed exactly as it was for 
engineering schools.
Carnegie Mellon had one graduate 
engineering department in the top five, 
computer engineering; while two busi­
ness programs broke the top five — the 
production management program was 
ranked second, and the business infç^T 
mation systems department was ranked 
third.
City Council considers move to protect gay rights
continued from page 1
vent harassment based on] sex­
ual orientation—we have all run 
into discrimination and harass­
ment because we are open about 
jvho we are,” said Thornton. “For 
example, recently, a student, af­
ter changing rooms because of 
roommate difficulties, returned 
to his old room to find a sign on 
the door saying, This hall is now 
fag-free.’ This is not an issue of 
whether or not homosexuality is 
right or wrong — it is an issue of 
hatred and prejudice.”
Others in the audience, how­
ever, disagreed. Reverend Rich­
ard Kunz, Tom Scott, and Dorn 
Gheckley, representing Citizens 
for Pittsburgh, held a press con­
ference earlier Thursday in oppo­
sition to the amendment.
“Are we really dealing with a 
disadvantaged minority here?” 
asked Checkley. “No, we’re not: 
we’re dealing with a powerful and 
affluent special interest group.”
' Scott agreed. “Discrimination 
really isn’t the issue,” he said. 
“They are just a special interest 
group trying to push their way 
into the city.”
“When we say that we’re con­
cerned that there’s not a demon­
strable pattern of discrimination,” 
said Checkley, “we literally mean 
ihat we don’t see that much suf­
fering. To enact broad civil rights 
protection to this group on the 
basis of behavior to address iso­
lated instances is taking a shot­
gun approach.... You don’t need 
‘sexual orientation’ added to the 
city ordinance to protect you 
against a violent assault.”
^lleva disagreed. “Gay men, les­
bians, and bisexuals have experi­
enced a long history of oppres­
sion and continued disadvan­
tages,” he said, “including, but 
not ¿United to, discrimination in 
housing areas, compromises in 
one’swelfare, one’s autonomy, and 
one’s dignity. These are serious 
and avoidable harms that ought 
not tc be tolerated.... So long as 
discrinination on the basis of 
sexual orientation is legally per­
mitted'in the areas just men- 
tioned.participation in public life 
and thi political process is seri­
ously Vampered for sexual mi­
norities} So long as [one’s rights] 
are in constant jeopardy, so long
as one can be excluded from ac­
cess to public accommodations, 
one faces de facto forms of social 
and political disenfranchise­
ment.”
Franzini disputed Citizens of 
Pittsburgh’s claim that “sexual 
orientation” is ambiguous.
“If someone attacks me yelling, 
‘faggot/ is there any ambiguity 
there? If someone fires me be­
cause I’m gay, is there any ambi­
guity there?” he asked.
A popular argument among 
opponents of the amendment was 
that God would not approve of the 
passage of the ordinance. Many 
speakers brought Bibles to the 
podium and quoted passages from 
various chapters, all of which, they 
said, condemned homosexuality. 
Some were especially fervent in 
their opposition of the idea.
Ernie Frederick feels that the 
consequences of passing the 
amendment for Pittsburgh will 
be severe. “God will withhold rain 
from this city,” he warned.
However, Upper St. Clair resi­
dent Mary Headley, who testified 
in favor of the amendment, didn’t 
agree that religious arguments

were valid. “Going to church 
makes you a Christian about as 
much as goinginto a garage makes 
you a car.... Look, aren’t we all 
God’s children?” she asked.
Another issue that surfaced
during the press conference and 
the hearing was that of the atti­
tudes and standards of behavior 
being^taught in public schools.
“I personally don’t want my 
children taught that homosexu­
ality is an alternative or that it’s 
good,” said Scott. He felt that the 
amendment would “muzzle” aj^ 
parent who objected to present­
ing homosexuality as an accept-.
able alternative in schools..........
Some believe that many schools 
have already taken this idea-to 
extremes. Cassi Geier, a student 
at Shaler High School, said that 
when the issue of homosexuality 
was broached in her current 
events class, her teacher’s re-, 
sponse was: “Parachute all them, 
gays into Cuba and then see what, 
happens.”
Safier, a representative of-> 
CMU’s Campus Association for 
Reproductive Rights, emphasized- 
the need for increased awareness 
of gay and lesbian issues in the, 
educational system. “Those 
people opposed to this amend­
ment do not seem to worry about 
the bigotry their children are 
taught in schools, and perhaps in 
their homes. They do not worry 
about the silent nod of approval 
society gives for treating some-" 
one differently because of a per­
ception that that person might be. 
a homosexual.” 1
Seniors’ response to our student loans 
has been overwhelming.
Everyone’s head-over-heels about 
Pittsburgh National's consolidation 
student loans and graduate school 
loans.
That's because with a Pittsburgh 
National consolidation student loan, 
you can cram all your eligible student 
loans into one* And, with the Student 
Loan Network Consolidation Program, 
you can choose the repayment option 
that gives you the lowest possible 
monthly payment available.
Or, if you're headed to graduate
school and need financing that won't 
cost you an arm and a leg, apply fora 
Supplemental Loan for Students (SLS) 
from Pittsburgh National. With an SLS 
loan, you can defer repayment until 
after you leave school. And our current 
rate is just 11.75%. That's lower than 
most other banks.
So, avoid the crush of higher educa­
tion costs after graduation. Beat the 
rush by calling now.

FORUM
Gays deserve legal rights, too
Although discrimination based 
on race, religion, or gender is 
prohibited by the City of Pitts­
burgh, discrimination based on 
sexual orientation encounters no 
legal obstacle here.
A gay rights amendment au­
thored by City Council Member 
Dan Cohen aims to change that, if 
approved by Council this week. 
The Council held a hearing Thurs­
day for public input on the amend­
ment; around three-fourths of 
those who showed ujj—including 
about ten members of the CMU 
community — spoke in favor of it.
As the gay and lesbian commu­
nities in America become more 
open about their sexuality, dis­
crimination against them has 
become increasingly visible. Prob­
lems faced by Pittsburgh’s gays 
and lesbians are substantiated by 
an endless list of offenses rooted 
'in prejudice and ignorance.
The problems even encroach
upon the borders of Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus: One student had 
to resort to a judicial board be­
cause the residence life program 
wasn’t strong enough in discour­
aging prejudice and ignorance in 
our own dormitories.
In deciding whether or not such 
discrimination should be made 
illegal, we hope that City Council 
remembers that discrimination of 
any kind is wrong. We want to see 
that ethical guideline backed up 
by a city law.
It’s City Council’s responsibility 
to guarantee individuals the right 
to be open about their sexual ori­
entation.
Passing this amendment won’t 
make up for all of the wrongs that 
have been done to the gay commu­
nity. It won’t even stop the igno­
rant and the prejudiced from vic­
timizing people. Butitmightsend 
a clear message that discrimina­
tion is intolerable.
GSIA needs to examine its image
The rankings game is a big busi­
ness. Sports has AP, UPI, USA 
Today, and Sports Illustrated — 
each with its own rankings.
The same phenomenon exists 
.with academic rankings. Business 
•Week, US News and World Report, 
:Petersen’s Guides, and others all 
rank universities and their com­
ponent departments.
. The rankings are subjective, but 
so are the opinions of prospective 
Students and employers. Once you 
factor in the human mind, points 
about validity go out the window.
; GSIA has fallen in widely-publi­
cized rankings of graduate busi­
ness schools from 7th to 13th. The 
;college’s administration seems 
¡worried, but not worried enough.
GSIA admini stration responded 
to the last ranking by sending a 
blistering letter to Business Week 
criticizing the survey’s methodol­
ogy. Other changes occurred, most 
notably a change in the core cur-
Mike Murphy —
Michael Murphy can finally 
torder new business cards. 
¡Murphy was named acting dean 
;of student affairs last summer with 
no guarantees of keeping the posi­
tion. Last week Warner Hall took 
;the word “acting” out of his title 
and gave him the job he’s earned.
Since Murphy took over the de- 
jpartment in July, noticeable 
¡changes have occurred. Orienta-
riculum, but these changes were 
not announced externally.
Now US News says that GSIA is 
the 14th best business school in 
the country.
Something more than an angry 
letter needs to happen this time. 
Falling ratings are self-perpetu­
ating. A lower-ranked school at­
tracts academically inferior stu­
dents, further diminishing the 
school’s reputation.
GSIA must concentrate more on 
public relations. It needs to get 
the word out about good things 
that are happening at the school.
It must also pay more attention 
to the rankings and their method­
ologies. Someone is finding fault 
with GSIA, and the college had 
best figure out why.
GSIA is one of the best business 
schools in the country. We know 
that, as do the alumni. It’s time 
others know that too. Otherwise, 
it may not remain so.
the right choice
tion was revamped, new social 
and educational programs like 
“The Forum” have been created, 
and the Beaux Arts Ball happened.
We heartily endorse the selec­
tion of Mike Murphy as dean of 
Student Affairs. He has shown 
his ability and desire to help the 
Carnegie Mellon student body, 
and that’s what being the dean of 
Student Affairs is all about.

Orientation 
proved 
beneficial 
in 1989
o§Editor:
I am writing in re­
sponse to Michael 
Drout’s 60 Coarse Letter tO 
column concerning FHitnr
the academic/social cullor
plight of the 1989 freshman class 
[“Freshman class lacks motivation 
from the University,” 2/27], In the 
article he cited Freshmen Orienta­
tion 1989 as being a major part of the 
problem. I strongly disagree.
In the four years that I have been 
here, I have seen students come and 
go in droves. The phrases “on proba­
tion —again,” “going to transfer,” and 
“shouldhave gone to a different school” 
have been popular every year. Having 
been an orientation counselor for the 
past three years, I have found that no 
matter what is tried, the same prob­
lems keep occurring. I would like to 
address the three problems that Mr. 
Drout said existed during Freshmen 
Orientation 1989, the first of which 
was class fragmentation.
I really don’t see class fragmenta­
tion, cliques, if you will, as a major 
problem. People do not like everyone 
they meet, so of course you don’t see 
one big clique of 1200 freshmen hang­
ing out together. In years past, Fresh­
man Camp was held at a place called 
Camp Lutherlyn. Since only about 
700 of the 1200 incoming freshmen 
were able to go, this fragmented the 
class from day one. The idea of Camp 
Heritage last fall was to give all fresh­
man an equal chance to go to camp if 
they wished.
Although it was desirable to have 
one large camp, there were no facili­
ties nearby to accommodate such a 
need, so the three campsites were our 
best possible alternative at the time. 
This way, freshmen were allowed to 
go to whichever camp they wished 
and with whatever new-found friends 
that they had made. Thus, the state­
ment about separation of new friends 
at camp was inaccurate.
Second, the small group meetings 
about campus life, in addition to the 
fun and games, were kept as informal

Os
as possible. In designing orientation, we 
felt that it would be better to talk about 
campus life in informal groups rather 
than just listening to lectures from the 
health department as was done in the 
past. In speakingwiththefreshmen.they 
felt that the discussion groups were more 
substantial than just playing the “Name 
Game” with 30 people they might never 
speak to again.
Third, the “Diversity” theme was in­
tended to provide a sense of campus 
community. I do agree with Drout on the 
point that the similarities between dif­
ferent groups could have been stressed 
more so than the differences. But to say it 
caused widespread campus fragmenta­
tion is bogus. I can’t tell you how many 
times in previous years when I was a 
counselor, that freshmen came up to me 
and asked if our group could do a skit 
about rap artists or basketball because 
they thought I should be good at those 
things.
The “Diversity” theme can’t be blamed 
for that because the themes in the past 
were “Horizons,” “Roots and Wings,” and 
“Bridges.” These perceptions are deeply 
rooted in society and media, so one can’t 
expect to solve them during an orienta­
tion, but it helps a lot if you talk about 
them rather than pretend they do not 
exist.
So the problem of the freshmen class, if 
there is one, can’t be blamed on Orienta­
tion. I agree with Drout, that the Univer­
sity should make an effort to let the 
freshmen know it cares that they exist. 
But that should extend to all students, 
not just the freshman. I don’t think it’s 
just the freshman class that has prob­
lems, although 40 percent on probation is 
rather high. These are the same prob­
lems that occur every year that the Uni­
versity has tried to address, but to date, 
has not been very successful in doing so.

Editor:
The much lam­
basted “diversity 
movement” on cam- Faccar cm 
pus proposes to elimi- the £djt 
nate just the calcu- 
lator”-type of mentality that Allan j 
Bourdius attacks in his letter [“Diver-, 
sity establishes character,” 2/27]. The. 
purpose of the course “Diversity, 
American Society, and America’s Cam-. 
puses” is not to teach students “ex-. 
actly what to think.” It is to encourage 
students to think for themselves.
My point, and the point of the “di­
versity movement” on campus is that, 
education in order to be informed is 
necessary in order for one to make the ; 
kinds of conscious choices that make , 
him/her a true individual, and not an . 
automaton.
Course material for “Diversity” is as > 
selective as are the closed lips of class 
members — and, fortunately, not, 
many of them are; students as well as 3 
instructors and lecturers steer each , 
class meeting. Discussions are not , 
“squelched.” Grading criteria receives 
its basis in analysis and degree of ? 
careful thought, not in reaching a pre- - 
scribed “doctrine.” Should opinions 
have to be justified? Do judges make “ 
decisions without factual biases?
Neither Linda Watkins, Alan Ken­
nedy, Bill Elliott, nor anyone I know 
has proposed some magic pathway to 
a utopian society in which “diversity” 
means eliminating “subversive” opin­
ions. Amore general consensus might 
be that each of us can improve society 
uniquely by becoming a more active ; 
participant.
Bourdius has no reason to “resent” 
anyone for “trying to take away” an ' 
environment at CMU conducive to free" 
expression. He should be applauding 
efforts like “Diversity” and Matt 
Ruben’s letter.
(“Diversity” meets each Tuesday at , 
6 pm in Baker 355. Visitors are wel­
come.)

the utmost intelligence, especially in 
his handling of the issues surround­
ing this year’s orientation.
Drout pointed out that the theme of 
Orientation, “Diversity,” had detri­
mental effects on the freshman class.
I must agree that an orientation theme 
truly affects how one progresses in the 
coming years of college life. I, for one, am 
a fine example.
I love CMU. I feel that I have learned 
and accomplished much, and I feel that 
this is mostly due to the theme of my ori­
entation, “Roots and Wings.” I am much 
healthier than I was when I first came to 
CMU. My diet now consists of carrots, 
radishes, rhubarb, turnips, and ginseng, 
contributing to a healthier body and com­
plexion. Since Orientation, I have filled
my household with two budgies, one 
cockatiel, seven finches, and one 
macaw. The musical sounds of these 
birds contribute to my ability to handle 
a great deal of stress.
I am evidence of the wonderful ef­
fects a carefully thought-out orienta­
tion theme can have on freshmen. I 
find it impressive that Drout realizes 
the importance of the orientation 
theme.

CMU authorities must prevent irresponsible drinking
o*
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
The movie 
Animal House 
has always 
made me think 
that college so­
cial life involved a lot of drinking 
and other such activities. One of 
the reasons I liked CMU was be­
cause of the high number of 
“smart” people attending it. My 
opinions changed toward college 
life after 1 was here for a few 
weeks. And lately, I am seeing 
that CMU, like any other school, 
breeds a bunch of young drink­
ers.
It is illegal in Pennsylvania for 
anyone under 21 to drink alcohol, 
yet such activities go on every 
day. Not wanting to point blame,
but fraternities do seem to be the 
main culprits. Although I realize 
that it is probably difficult and 
expensive, Campus Police does 
not seem to do anything besides 
give out citations to those stu­
dents who are caught drinking in 
public.
There must be some way to 
prohibit alcohol being served to 
minors at all University functions 
(including fraternity parties). 
Some people say that I don’t drink 
because I’m a goody-two-shoes 
who hasn’t been weaned by my 
parents. This is hardly the case. I 
choose not to drink because I 
think it is irresponsible and stu­
pid. I am not talking about the 
student who has one beer once a 
week to be sociable. I am upset
that there are so many people 
who tend to drink to excess so of­
ten.
I was enraged by the letter in 
The Tartan [“Alcohol does not 
excuse fraternity from personal 
responsibility,” 2/27], How dare 
anyone use intoxication as an 
excuse for violence? How many 
members of the fraternities on 
campus are over 21? Why does 
the Student Senate give the OK 
to posters that advertise drink­
ing events (i.e., “Around the 
World”)? I’d suggest that you ref­
use any fraternity which wishes 
to poster with such blatant invi­
tations to drinking.
Rush events should always be 
dry. Campus Police should deal 
with underage or irresponsible
drinking as severely as it can. I do 
not want to spend another week­
end dealing with immature drink­
ers who have thrown up outside 
my dorm room. I do not wish to 
read about any incidents in the 
C&I report anymore. And I never 
ever want to hear about someone 
being harassed by a person who 
had been drinking.
To all those under 21, why do 
you continue to drink when it is 
illegal? To all those over 21, 
drink responsibly (and that in­
cludes not serving those under 
age).
I invite anyone to respond to 
this letter proving to me that the 
above abuses are OK.

In response to 'the four girls 
who wrote a letter to the editor 
[“Alcohol does not excuse frater­
nity from personal responsibil­
ity,” 2/27], I sympathize with your 
alleged confrontation with Beta 
: — although I find it ironic that 
I seven brothers would take time 
' out of their party to harass you for 
• no apparent reason. It sounds like
a low-budget horror show. If the 
experience was as traumatic as 
you portrayed it, it seems sen­
sible to report it to Campus Secu­
rity.
Regardless, I fail to understand 
how broadcasting the incident 
through The Tartan helps mat­
ters. Rather, it seems to blast it 
all into the realm of hot campus 
gossip. Personally, I resent the 
editorial page being turned into a 
soap opera.
I believe that The Tartan staff 
has enough journalistic sense to 
recognize the value of the letters 
it receives. So a special request to 
The Tartan: do your readership a 
favor—don’t reduce our editorial 
to a personal boxing match (like
lastyear’s-Erc^Mirer-stylejabsbe- 
tween ATO brothers and their 
fellow lecture students). In this 
case, Beta is surely entitled a 
rebuttal. Other than that, I hope 
there are more consequential 
items that can use the space. If 
I’m mistaken on this count, I 
humbly resign my argument. And 
then I also resign from the hu­
man race.
Before anyone gets the urge to 
write a letter in response to my 
response, I realize that I am al­
most defeating my purpose by 
simply acknowledging the issue. 
I do not defend (nor do I think 
anyone could rationally defend) 
the right of a drunken fraternity 
brother (or a drunken anyone, for
that matter) to harass anybody. I 
do believe passionately in free 
speech, preferably on a more in­
telligent level. At the same time, 
I respect the editorial section as a 
rational field for the voicing of 
social and political issues — not 
as an inflated gossip section.

Greek Sing chairs7 
disclaimers were childish

I would like

«»
Student Senate’s Funding and 
Recognition Committee because 
of the comments, both written 
and verbal, presented at Friday 
night’s Greek Sing.
The statements made by the 
Greek Sing chairs and the writ­
ten disclaimer in the program 
were a childish attempt to pres­
ent Big Brothers and Big Sis­
ters as a group abused by a 
tyrannical Senate.
We are sorry if the Greek 
Sing chairs do not agree with 
Senate’s decision to deny a spe­
cial allocation to Greek Sing. 
However, Senate’s reasons for 
the denial ofth at allocation were 
valid ones; this fact has appar-
ently been overlooked. Like all 
other student organizations, 
Greek Sing had ample opportu­
nity to present the reasons for 
its request and to convince 
Senate that its request should 
be granted; if the persons re­
sponsible for convincing Senate 
that the allocation was neces­
sary failed in that duty, that is, 
no excuse for unjustly abusing 
Senate in this way. We feel that 
the chairs’ actions were imma-i 
ture, irresponsible, and unex­
cusable.
Anyone who wishes to hear 
the full story about why Greek 
Sing was denied an allocation is • 
welcome to appear at a Senate 
meeting — we will be happy to, 
discuss the issue.

abortion. The pro-choice group 
was Carnegie Mellon’fe Campus 
Association for Reproductive 
j Rights (CARR). The other 
; group,which was opposed to abor- 
; tiOn, was People Concerned for 
; the Unborn Child(PCÙC),aPitts- 
; burgh-based lobbying and politi- 
, cal-action group.
I On the weekend of March 2, 
i PCUC had the following message
¦ on its telephone hotline: “Thank
¦ you to everyone who participated 
; in the leafletting effort at CMU 
; and Pitt last Wednesday. It was 
; interesting to have NARAL there 
! with us. There were many inter- 
! esting conversations. Pro-lifers 
! should know that.the abortion 
; proponents we encounter are not 
> interested in reading our mate- 
; rial because they have already 
; made up their minds. They don’t
believe illegal abortions were done 
before January, 1973, and they 
believe we invented all the infor­
mation in our brochures. There 
were many smiles of welcome and 
words of encouragement at these 
meccas of learning. NARAL was 
distributing condoms as freely as 
they gave out printed material. 
We live in a very mixed-up soci­
ety. What we want the pro-abor- 
tiOn students at Pitt and CMU as 
well as their mentors to know is 
that we were glad to be there, 
we’ll be back, and we’ll continue 
to pray for you despite your pleas 
to the contrary.”
We feel this message misrepre­
sents CARR and its philosophy in 
several ways.
First, CARR is a student group 
andhas no direct ties whatsoever 
to NARAL (the National Abor­
tion Rights Action League). 
CARR’s activity on campus, un­
like that of PCUC, was organized 
by CMU students.
Second, we are pro-choice, not 
pro-abortion: we believe that
individuals should be in control 
of their own reproductive desti­
nies.
Third, it is general knowledge 
that illegal abortions were per­
formed prior to the Roe v. Wade 
decision in January 1973. It is a 
matter of public record that 
Magee Women’s Hospital had a 
ward dedicated to women suffer­
ing the effects of unsafe, illegal 
abortion. We oppose the death, 
injury, and suffering that arise 
when abortion is either illegal or 
inaccessible.
Fourth, we have read the litera­
ture that was distributed by 
PCUC, and agree with some of its 
content. Medically established 
facts about fetal development are 
undisputed. However, we believe 
that their selective use of such 
facts is misleading. For example, 
they claim that some brain activ­
ity can be detected as early as 6 to 
8 weeks. They neglect to state 
that the formation of the cerebral 
cortex is not complete until the 
8th month. We question their
selective use of medical facts to 
make their point. We also find 
that such facts do not imply a 
clear and obvious fetal right to 
life.
Their arguments for fetal right 
to life are generic with respect to 
the religious premise that life 
begins at conception. This prem­
ise is irrelevant in a secular con­
text, and imposing it on all mem­
bers of our pluralistic society vio­
lates the constitutionally man­
dated separation of church and 
state. Therefore, we find their lit­
erature misleading and empty of 
significant content.
Finally, wë wonder at their 
concern over our distribution of 
condoms. Contraceptives and 
instructions regarding their 
proper use help to eliminate the 
need for abortions. Do they op­
pose eliminating the need for 
abortion?

A recent ar­
ticle in Kar- 
neg’-e [“Coun- Letter tO 
selors lend a the Edjt()r 
sympathetic
ear,” 2/20] contained a misrepre­
sentation of my viewpoint on the 
subject of unplanned pregnancy.
On page 3 there are two para­
graphs summarizing my view. 
The first paragraph is correct. 
However, there are some serious 
difficulties in the second para­
graph. First, I do believe that I 
have the right of reflecting Judaic 
principles in my counseling work 
on the college campus. Second, 
we do encourage students of vari­
ous ideologies and viewpoints to 
feel comfortable seeking counsel 
within our qualified and profes­
sional agency. We pride ourselves 
on a nurturing and caring atmos­
phere. The implication of the
second paragraph seemed to imply 
that we make referrals to Ortho­
dox rabbis.
While we are certainly eager to 
make referrals to various helping 
professionals when appropriate, 
we are equally enthusiastic to use 
our own training skills to provide 
appropriate counsel within our 
own setting.
Another issue has to do with my 
recommendation about adoption. 
That is only one alternative that 
a woman might wish to consider. 
It would be one that might or 
might not be recommended, de­
pending on the outcome of the 
dialogue within the counseling 
setting here at Hillel.
Essentially, our purpose is to 
provide professional pastora!l 
counseling within the context of 
Jewish values. I have a doctorate

I would like 
to apologize

Relations Committee for the 
illegal postering which occurred 
the day before the Student 
Senate Happy Hour. In our at­
tempts to notify the campus of a 
chance to voice concerns to their

regrettable error in judgment.
I agree that it is hypocritical
to expect the campus commu­

do. Student Senate will pay a 
fine in the amount of $35 for the 
seven illegally posted signs to 
the Division of Student Affairs.' 
Although it was only seven of

mitigate the seriousness of the 
violation. Again, I offer my sin­
cere regrets for the actions of

1 purpose of this was to expose the
• false information and propaganda 
of this particular program, and to
; improve the functioning of the 
;board.
Particular examples of false in- 
: formation include a photo of a

1 said to have taken place in the
• “West Bank,” false claims that 
members of the Israeli security
¦ forces “target” women and chil- 
; dren, and maps which deny the 
; historic place of Israel within the
mandate of Palestine, which also 
included Jordan. The tabled lit­
erature makes the destructive 
claim that Jews arebeing coerced 
by Israel to leave the Soviet Un­
ion while in fact they are going 
there because of their desire to 
return to their historic homeland 
and the growing anti-Semitism 
in the Soviet Union. The settle­
ment of Soviet Jews in Israel is a 
matter of great pride and demon­
strates the vitality of Israel for 
the Jewish people.
It is difficult for an organiza­
tion like the Political Speakers 
Forum Board to be entirely plu­
ralistic, and groups with all view­
points should have the freedom to 
express their views. However, 
there should be some guidelines 
as to how it is run, and I have 
submitted a list of suggestions to 
Senate. These include:
1. An open planning session for
political speakers to which all 
campus political groups are in­
vited;
2. Having Senate review the 
definition of a political organiza­
tion to determine which groups 
can participate in the Board;
3. Establish a review process 
for the Board so that an attempt 
is made to avoid blatant propa­
ganda or hate group material; and
4. Establish a sound advertis­
ing policy for the Board. In par­
ticular, posters printed by the 
Board should be clearly distin­
guished from those of the spon­
soring organization and should 
provide objective information. The 
new constitution that is in the 
works and the current recruiting 
effort are positive steps for the 
Political Speakers Forum Board.

President’s Ball. But what’s it all 
about? Well, I didn’t know, and 
neither did the dozen students I 
asked.
I assumed it was for alumni 
who had donated a lot of money to 
the University during the last 
year, and discreetly asked an 
attendee to see if I was right. “Uh, 
no," he said, “Most of us aren’t 
alumni. We were invited.”
So who were they? I hope they 
were faculty and staff — consid­
ering all our movies, dances, and 
activities, they deserve a ball. Did 
attendees have to do something 
special to get an invitation? Who
paid for it? I invite the office of 
Public Relations to answer these 
questions.
Oh yes, alcohol was served. 
What faculty member signed the 
form taking responsibility for any 
accidents that may occur? Or did 
the exclusion of students free 
Carnegie Mellon from all liabil­
ity?
Please shed some light.

12The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 13 March 1990
Pittsburgh should leave CMU alone, once and for all
Greetings and salutations! I was 
going to discuss the censoring of 
Mort Walker this week, but it 
seems more pressing news has 
sprung.
Did you know that the city is 
challenging the tax exempt status 
of CMU, and other universities in 
the area? This attack is coming in 
two parts; one tax on research 
grants and the other a tax on 
property that the city believes 
have developed into “profit mak­
ing subsidiaries.” These would in­
clude stadiums that hold football 
and basketball games and con­
certs, campus restarants, and off- 
campus apartments that are not 
allocated the same way as dorms 
are.
The research grant tax is of 
great concern. The city wants to 
place a 6% tax on University re­
search grants — which would
Rich Robinson
strike at the heart of CMU and 
Pitt. Last year, the city said that 
it could have raised $1.6 million 
in revenue from such a tax. But 
the city, in its complete inepti­
tude and rush to make a profit, 
decided to ignore the costs. CMU 
would have had to pay out 
$724,200 while Pitt’s cost would 
have been $859,200.
Universities are tax exempt 
because they provide a non-profit 
service to the nation. Not only do 
universities provide students with 
an education essential to the 
nation and world, but they per­
form research to increase under­
standing of the way the world 
works. Louis Popper, chief gen­
eral council at Pitt, says it best. 
“The mission of a university is to 
discover and disseminate knowl­
edge. There is nothing more fun­
damental to our mission than 
research. We are a research uni­
versity.” This applies to both CMU 
and Pitt.
City officials are simply looking 
for a place that’s easy to tax, and 
to make a quick profit. $1.6 mil­
lion is a nice number to have 
around. But they don’t care about 
any long-term consequences, only 
short-term benefits.
This was obvious when they 
started their campaign to find 
tax-exempt property. Because 
Duquesne holds concerts at its 
stadium, the city feels it can con­
sider the stadium to be profit 
generating. The city doesn’t care 
that in 1989 only 60 hours out of 
the whole year was used for con­
certs. The rest of the time was 
used for educational purposes.
Pitt operates off campus apart­
ments because of a housing short­
age, and because many landlords 
do not provide students with 
needed services. But the city 
claims that these apartments 
have “developed profit making 
subsidiaries” for the university, 
because the rates used to charge 
students are the same as regular 
apartments. Also, these apart­
ments are allocated out of a dif­
ferent department, not university 
housing,. Unlike CMU, Pitt has 
an extremely large student popu­
lation, and perhaps decentraliza­
tion is the most effective way for 
the university to deal with the 
situation.
How long, though, until the city 
decides that all off campus hous- 
ingis taxable? Rightnow they are
ignoring the basic premise that 
universities are tax exempt. There 
are places on CMU, even hospital 
areas that are threatened. The 
city has sunk low when it decides 
to tax places that saves lives.
Why should students be con­
cerned about this? It’s the 
administration’s problem, right? 
Wrong — guess who gets to foot 
the bill. One way or another, it’s 
the students. Tuition will go up, 
student services will have to be 
cut. Classes will be larger, there 
will be fewer faculty — or under­
qualified faculty — less student 
organization funding, fewer ac­
tivities, and so on.
It’ll be a cold day in hell when I 
let the city reduce or take away 
Carnival because th ey want more 
money. Maybe they should learn 
to deal with what they have—we 
all do.
The Sandinistas’ fall is just the beginning
On February 25th, the Sandin- 
ista regime, headed by Daniel 
Ortega, was voted out of office — 
officially and legally — and re­
placed by Violeta Chamorro, 
leader of the coalition Uno party. 
It was bound to happen, and sure 
enough it did.
Since 1979, when the Sandin- 
ista revolutionaries toppled the 
Somoza government, the sup­
posed “promises” by Ortega and 
his revolutionaries, including 
elections in 1979, elections in
1984, and a promise to stop fund­
ing the terrorists, along with basic 
human rights and freedoms, 
became nothing but mere idle 
words.
As a result, hundreds of thou­
sands of Nicaraguans have fled 
the country, eventually seeking 
refuge in Honduras and the U.S., 
and many more have expressed 
great indignation and dissatis­
faction with the Sandinista re­
gime.
David Schwartz
The only unarguable achieve­
ments of the Sandinista regime 
have included the forceful recruit­
ment of young Nicaraguans to 
serve in the Sandinista army, the 
suppression of religious organi­
zations, and the suppression of 
what was once the free press. It 
seems appropriate that the 
Sandinista regime should fall 
through a fair and due process of 
election in light of the phenome­
nal and overwhelming political 
change going on throughout East­
ern Europe, and for that matter 
across the globe.
Yet not all the excitement of the 
vast changes in Europe and the 
free elections in Nicaragua are 
being accepted warmly by others. 
In 1959, Fidel Castro came to 
power in Cuba after several years
of bloody fighting with Batista 
forces. Eventually, his revolution 
took a firm hold, and after 31 
years of promises to change, 
nothing tangible has yet been 
offered.
While other nations in Europe 
have shed the trappings of their 
communist oppressors — nations 
which now remove the hammer 
and sickle from their flag and 
adamantly demand self determi­
nation — Fidel Castro has de­
clared himself to be the last and 
purest bastion of Communism 
left. These beliefs can only be 
marked as the depraved rantings 
of a terrified dictator fearful of 
losing his iron-fist grasp.
Castro was very quick to con­
demn Mikhail Gorbachev and his 
policies regarding Perestroika and 
Glasnost, claiming that a move 
toward political and economic 
freedom was a reprehensible move 
against Communism and Marx­
ism.
Where are CMU’s handicapped students?
A friend and I were in the midst 
of a very interesting conversation 
about things we happen to see or 
notice people do when they think 
they’re not being watched. 
Scratching private parts took a 
large share of the discussion.
My friend and I, both being very 
observantpeople, then turned the 
conversation to something we no­
tice about CMU which is not 
quite noticeable on the surface. It 
all began when we led our discus­
sion to that of the student body.
“Hey Sue,” my friend started. 
“Did you realize this campus is 
not diverse enough because
Susan Abrams
there’s no handicapped people on 
campus here?”
“You mean as in the physically 
handicapped — wheelchairs — 
right?”
“Yeah. We just don’t have any 
handicapped students here.” 
“Oh, I noticed that when I first 
came here. It’s a sad thing, too. 
But take a good look around this 
campus, and tell me how one in a
wheelchair could survive.”
“Well, there’s some ramps here 
and there — isn’t that enough?” 
“Oh, no. They need much more. 
They need these ramps to be eve­
rywhere, not just here and there. 
They need reasonably-placed ele­
vators in eveiy building — not 
like where they hide them in 
Doherty and Porter Halls. You 
complain of being late for class 
often enough? Well, just imagine 
if you were in a wheelchair, and

I must congratulate Cyert. In 1 
response to the city’s plans, he 
said, “We are legally tax exempt, 
and I will vigorously oppose any — 
effort to cheat on that.” We, as— 
students and faculty, have to - 
prevent these taxes. They are not^ 
legal.

tion. But, obviously we’re con­
cerned because I don’t think that....

Does Castro say this in light of 
the fact that the Soviet Union can 
no longer support Castro’s eco­
nomic and military needs?
Over the past several years, 
Cuba has been suffering from 
great food shortages and other 
economic hardships as a result of 
the Soviet Unions refusal to main­
tain the 6.57 billion dollar per 
year subsidization of Cuba’s eco­
nomic, and more importantly, 
military needs. So what it comes 
down to, is that Fidel does fear 
losing the reins of power. And he 
should be afraid.
The age of the glorious and 
romantic Marxist revolutions is 
something that Castro continues 
to hang on to, but the genuine 
proliferation of freedom and de­
mocracy is something which he 
refuses to accept. But, eventu­
ally, Castro will also topple.

Pittsburgh vs. CMU: the fight of the decade
The fight of the decade wasn’t 
Douglas vs. Tyson. It’s the City of 
Pittsburgh vs. Carnegie Mellon.
In the last few weeks the city 
has tried to tax some of our prop-. 
erties, take away even more park­
ing spaces, and has given us cya­
nide-tainted land. At least the 
LCB has stayed away ... so far.
It seems that Pittsburgh has 
decided that instead of targeting 
Grateful Dead fans or putting up 
street signs, the city has decided 
to 'spend its time harassing its 
universities, especially CMU.
Problems with the city taking 
away our parking spaces have

better to do than to hand out $25 
parking fines.
It’s hard to decide who is the 
real culprit here. On our urban 
campus a car truly is a luxury. At 
least until you start getting used 
to 3 am Ritter’s Diner breaks, 
then the car starts to become a 
necessity.
However, that does not excuse 
our beloved school which has 
watch edparkingspaceafter park­
ing space disappear next to cam­
pus without replacing them. The 
parking garage, when completed, 
should help, assuming of course 
that they allow students to get 
spaces in it.
Nor is Pittsburgh off the hook. 
America’s third most livable city 
has discovered students asits next 
greatest revenue source. If Pitts­
burgh weren’t so anal retentive 
about catching people who park
for an hour and ten minutes on 
Devon Road, it wouldn’t have to 
spend money for salaries for 
people to write the tickets.
Pittsburgh, though, isn’t just 
targeting students — Sophie and 
Co. have decided to knock Dick 
and Wesley down a notch too. 
Pittsburgh is trying to get Carne­
gie Mellon, Pitt, Duquesne, and 
some of the area hospitals to start 
paying taxes on some of our land.
Nevermind that as a non-profit 
University, we’re tax exempt. 
Maybe the city thinks that we’re 
such nice guys that we’ll just give 
them some money. After all, that’s 
what Carnegie did when he real­
ized that the only way he could 
spend all of his money was to buy 
the state of Pennsylvania.
Notmanyofourpropertieshave 
been cited. Curiously, Pittsburgh 
wants taxes on the land we rent to 
WQED. Considering they pay us 
a rent of $1 a year, you’d think 
that the taxes wouldn’t be that 
high.
As all of this is occurring, our 
partnership with Pittsburgh to
develop a high tech park along 
the Monogahela has hit more 
delays. We can’t break ground 
because there’s cyanide in the soil. 
And once the ground is cleaned 
up, we can redesign the building 
which costs too much for us to 
build. You would presume that 
the taxes and parking lots for the 
building have already been 
settled.
With all the problems we’ve 
had with Pittsburgh, I wonder 
why we haven’t explored Robert 
Morris College's option — mov­
ing to the suburbs. Of course, there 
isn’t nearly as much glamour in 
going to school in Coraopolis as 
there is in being in Pittsburgh, a 
sad statement indeed.
So we’re stuck, at least for 
awhile, in our fight with Pitts­
burgh. But it could be worse, the 
city could try to force us to talk 
like the natives.

Censorship soars to new heights
I have a pen-pal named Paul 
Vright who is doing time in a 
^shington state penitentiary 
nd has a big problem with cen- 
orship. Not the kind of censor- 
hi'p that happens when someone 
alls you that you can’t bum a 
iree-by-five foot fabric soaked in 
ghter fluid on a windy day be- 
ause you just might ignite the 
air or flesh of a couple hundred 
ntookers. Paul’s problem is a bit 
lore serious. Mr. Webster would 
;1I you that a censor is a supervi- 
or' of morals. Mr. Wright would 
robably tell you that a censor is 
le prison official that inspects 
lmost every letter, newspaper, 
jr publication Paul receives in 
ie; mail and withholds what he 
Desn’t like. The prison system 
as withheld everything from 
terature sent to him by the 
nitarians and Quakers to Com- 
unist and Anarchist, publica- 
ons, to the book Great American 
[ays of The 20th Century.
How might the prison system 
iactto someone who is obvious'ly 
Attempting to become a well- 
mnded individual? The Associ- 
:e Secretary of Corruptions al- 
that no one in the state 
ison system “receives such a 
irge volume or amount of contro- 
¡rsial, exotic, inflammatory and 
usual publications as Mr. 
rright does.” It is interesting 
at all this literature is often 
jpt from Paul. Other prisoners 
ave had no difficulty receiving 
;erature and publications from 
rertly neo-fascist organizations 
ke Aryan Nations and various

Christian white power groups.
Paul’s problems don’t end there. 
Based solely on the mail he re­
ceives, the prison officials have 
concluded that Paul is either a 
Communist or an Anarchist, so 
they won’t let him work or earn 
any money in prison. Since they 
know he tells people on the out­
side about the repression he is 
suffering in what he likes to call 
“Boys Kamp,” Paul gets “special” 
treatment. For example, when he 
mailed a letter to a friend, the 
wardens ripped open the enve­
lope and photocopied the contents 
so they could hold his comments 
against him if needed.
What I’m saying is that if we 
don’t begin to watch what hap­
pens around us a little bit more 
closely and respond, our lives 
might be a lot like Paul’s in the 
future. You might want to think 
about how some prisons inspect 
or censor everything the inmates 
read or see the next time you look 
the other way when a store takes 
a record off the shelves because of 
it’s lyrics or artwork. Or the next 
time Rev. Donald Wildmon tries 
to purchase the rights to a movie 
he disagrees with like The Last 
Temptation of Christ only so he 
can destroy the prints and keep 
people from viewing it. Or the 
next time a store like Walden- 
books refuses to sell books by au­
thors like Salmon Rushdie or 
magazines like Spin but you con­
tinue to shop there. Or the next 
time an adult book store owner in 
North Carolina is imprisoned and 
fined for selling three typical 
porno mags to an undercover cop 
and you look the other way be­
cause you probably never shopped 
at that kind of store. Or the next 
time right-wing Christian forces 
campaign to get books like The 
Wizard ofOz or How To Eat Fried 
Worms removed from public or 
elementary school libraries and 
they win because no one showed 
up.to challenge them.
Sooner or later, censorship is 
going to affect your life if it doesn’t 
already, and the availability of 
media and entertainment you 
once were able to enjoy just might 
not exist anymore. If you’d like to 
learn more about what certain 
people in this country are pre­
venting you from seeing, hearing, 
or reading, I highly recommend 
sending a dollar or two to the 
following organizations and ask- 
ingfor some literature. You might

Whatever happened to 
playground equality?
Karl’s Korner
Karl Banks
I don’t think I really get it. There 
is a difference—it has nothing to 
do with physical differences. It all 
started in fourth grade when all 
of the girls were given a special 
lecture and all of the boys went 
outside to play. From that day on, 
there was a barrier of trust be­
tween boys and girls. I had al­
ways thought it was just some­
thing for kids, but now I think it’s 
extending to men and women.
As a fourth grader, I expected 
the girls to giggle and tell secrets, 
but what pisses me off is that at 
age 18, I still have to deal with 
fourth-grade girls telling secrets 
in the bathroom of some expen­
sive restaurant.
Ok, here’s the situation. I’ll 
change the names to protect the 
innocent. Candy was sitting on 
my left and Rose was going to be 
sitting on my right. The movie 
was going to start in about37sec­
onds. Rose asked if I would move 
so she could sit and talk to Candy. 
“No!” I firmly replied. I was al­
ready settled and the movie was 
about to start. Why did she have 
to talk to Candy? In fact why 
should I sit through a movie with 
them talkingto each other? I hung 
tough (New Kids reference), and 
as usual when dealing with fe­
males in such a situation, I was 
made to look like an ass, as well as 
feeling guilty.
So why is that they always have. 
to talk to each other? Every single , 
occurrence in their lives is hashed 
and re-hashed in the utmost se­
crecy and confidence. They must 
stop all activity to find a rest room 
in order to discuss what I had just 
said at the dinner table.
It started when I asked my girl­
friend Selena what it was that 
they said at that lecture while I 
was at recess in fourth grade. She 
got all red, giggled, and refused to 
tell me. What was the big deal, 
why are women’s bodily functions 
so secret?
I am not a misogynist, I have 
respect for women, but I can’t, 
understand them sometimes, so I 
come off as a chauvinist.
Why is it that all of my female 
friends have documents and let­
ters lying around that are not to 
be read — by anyone? I don’t have 
such things. Do I not do these, 
things because I have a different 
sex organ?
Why can’t we be like we were in 
fourth grade? Why do we have to 
have completely different person­
ality types? It wasn’t like this in 
third grade when we all played 
kickball together.
It was way cool to be truly equal. 
then.

After seven years, Anderson moves on
SPORTSPEAK
' by Josh Ruben
Larry’s gone, 
now what?
With all that’s been happen­
ing in Eastern Europe, I have 
begun to feel somewhat sorry 
for all of the great spy novel 
writers in the world.
I mean, with the Cold War 
being all but over, what is the 
incentive to write the next The 
Hunt for Red October?
I feel bad for those authors 
since their careers were made 
upon a natural state of the 
world. They did not invent the 
“Red Scare,” the press and State 
Department did. Nor did these 
writers have to embellish the 
state of the Cold War, we, as 
patriotic Americans did that 
ourselves.
Just like that, these hard 
working, talented writers are 
out of jobs. But, spy novelists 
are not alone in their plight of 
being in a subject matter 
vacuum.
Baseball writers have had to 
deal with baseball nostalgia and 
trivia columns for weeks due to 
the current lockout.
But even I find myself in the 
same abyss as that of the spy 
novelist. Now that Larry Ander­
son is no longer coach of the 
varsity basketball team, one of 
the old standbys for complain­
ing is gone. I, as well as the rest 
of the people on the CMU sports 
scene, will fall into a rut.
But I am not going to take the 
time now to blast Larry Ander­
son. I have never lowered 
myself to that level. I have 
criticized his coaching tactics in 
the past, but so has anyone who 
has ever seen a men’s basket­
ball game. Besides, I predicted a 
long time ago that he would be 
gone either before or shortly 
after the turn of the decade.
I heard that the press release 
was typed up about Larry’s 
leaving before anyone decided if 
he would quit, or if he would be 
fired. The release probably 
looked like: “Coach Larry 
Anderson Circle One: (was 
fired from) or (quit) his position 
as head basketball coach....” A 
professor told me that it was a 
firing that manifested itself into 
a resignation. I love that one.
All kidding aside, I’ll miss 
Larry. I talked with him at 
airports on away games and 
always got along with him.
The criterion for determining 
a good coach is not the win/loss 
column. Many a good coach has 
had more than a few losing sea­
sons. But a while a great coach 
may not always be a winning 
coach, a great coach knows how 
to teach the game.
Bobby Knight, while volatile, 
is a teacher. The same for 
Tommy Lasorda and even Pat 
Riley. Larry never taught his 
guys how to play the game. He 
just let his teams loose with 
only what they learned in high 
school or on some playground as 
the only means at their dis­
posal.
Even if they did not win 
much, the Tartans should have 
shown some signs of improve­
ment over a season. A team gets 
better as it learns the game and 
how each player plays. But 
Larry never focused on team­
work, only on individual 
strengths.
I wish Larry Anderson well. I 
hope he finds happiness wher­
ever he goes from here. Who 
knows, maybe he’ll go to 
Disneyland.

After seven years as h ead coach 
of CMU’s men’s basketball team, 
Larry Anderson has announced 
his resignation effective June 30.
Anderson’s resignation comes 
after the team had suffered its 
worst season in over 15 years, 
winning only four of 25 games. 
Under his tenure, the Tartans 
were 56-101. Anderson’s best 
season came in 1985-86, when 
the team had an 11-9 record.
“I had a chance to work with
some very fine people at Carnegie 
Mellon and I’d like to thank the 
university for that opportunity,” 
said Anderson. “However, at this 
point in time I feel that it is in my 
best interest to move on.” 
According to Athletic Director 
John Harvey, a search process 
has already begun to find 
Anderson’s successor. A commit­
tee of two athletic faculty mem­
bers, two additional faculty 
members, and two members of 
the men’s basketball team will 
meet prospective candidates on 
campus to help evaluate them.
Women’s basketball coach Gerri 
Seidl and sophomore Chris Dobbs 
have already been named to the 
committee.
“My definite goal is to have it 
[the search] wrapped up before 
people go into exams,” said Har­
vey.
The committee will be charged 
with evaluating candidates that 
are screened through an initial 
solicitation of resumes. A similar 
process was used last year for the 
selection of a new swimming 
coach. As of Friday, the univer­
sity has received nearly 20 in­
quiries concerning the position.
“We’ll get to speak to the pros­
pects beforehand,” said Dobbs. 
“We’ll have guidelines for what 
we want in a coach. I’m glad to be 
a part of it.”
Harvey already has some crite­
ria envisioned for the newbasket- 
ball coach to meet. “In my mind, 
and I believe the university's 
mind, the most important thing 
[for the coach to do] is to bring a 
satisfactory experience to all in­
volved. The object is to win, but 
the purpose is much broader than

Sanford Rivers moonlights as NFL official:'
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Sports Editor
Sanford Rivers has hit the big 
time.
In the world of football officiat­
ing, he is one of th e best in a sea of 
striped shirts. That is, this assis­
tant vice presidentfor enrollment 
at CMU has joined the ranks of 
the profession’s best, as a Na­
tional Football League official. 
The 1989 NFL season marked 
River’s first year of making calls 
for the biggest, best, and most 
competitive football players in the 
country.
“When you get to the NFL, it’s 
like you have your house on the 
hill — it’s the epitome of what the 
profession has to offer,” said Riv­
ers. “You have arrived.”
On March 23, 1989, Rivers re-

ceived a phone call that informed 
him that the NFL had accepted 
him as an official, and he was in­
structed to report to work that
fall.
But he waited a long time for 
that phone call — about 20 years. 
In 1970, Rivers came to CMU as 
an employee, but he still took time 
out for some intramural football. 
Anyone who plays IM football 
must at some time officiate, and 
when it was Rivers’ turn, he 
turned some heads. He caught 
the eye of IM Director Earl J. 
Birdy, who encouraged him to 
pursue an officiating career.
According to Birdy, Rivers was 
initially somewhat reluctant to 
pursue the idea, but went through 
with it with Birdy’s encourage­
ment. “Mr. Birdy did everything 
for me except pay the $20 fee to 
take the exam,” said Rivers.
“He was one of the most re­
spected officials in the [IM] pro­
gram. He really knew the rules
well,” said Birdy.
Birdy himself spent 25 years 
officiating college football, most 
of it Division I, so he was able to 
spot officiating talent when he 
saw it. “I knew he was destined to 
be a great official the first time I 
saw him,” he said.
Birdyisasimpressedtoday with 
Rivers’ officiating as he was 20 
years ago. “He does an excellent 
job. He knows the rules, and he is 
in great physical shape,” said 
Birdy. “When that ball is snapped 
he has got to move.”
After passing an exam that 
certified him to work in Pennsyl­
vania, Rivers set his feet down on 
the longroad to the NFL. In 1972, 
he worked his first game. “I was 
officiating the Catholic grade 
school games with kids about this 
high,” Rivers said, motioning to
his waist level. But after the grade 
schools, Rivers steadily pro­
gressed — junior high followed, 
then high school, high schocii 
playoffs and then small colleges.
After that, in 1984, he was asked 
to join the Independent College 
Football Officials Association. It 
was here that Rivers had his first 
taste of the big-time, officiating 
at games involving Pitt, Perm 
State, Notre Dame, West Virginia, 
Syracuse, Boston College, Army, 
Navy, Temple and Rutgers—“the 
powerhouse football teams of the 
East,” he said. ^
Rivers fondly remembers ,^s 
first moment officiating at,tb,e 
big-time college level, which .was 
at West Virginia. He was warned 
that nerves would strike him- at

CMU Rugby dominates UPJ

started off its six-game spring season with 
a 12-4 victory over the University of Pitts­

Played at 
Frick Park, the game was marked by 
numerous mistakes on both sides, result­
ing in far more exhausting scrum-downs 
than either team’s scrummies were accus­
tomed to. However, Carnegie Mellon out- 
muscled and out-finessed the UPJ pack to 
dominate what was largely a defensive 
battle.
Carnegie Mellon jumped to an early first 
half lead when graduate student Geoff 
Millyen blazed almost 70 yards through 
UPJ tacklers to score a four-point try, 
followed by a points-after kick for another 
two.
Redoubling their efforts, the UPJ play- 
ers repeat­
edly drove 
the ball deep 
into Carne­
gie Mellon 
territory only 
to be stopped 
and forced 
back to their 
own end of 
the field. 
Senior Mark 
Wabalas, a 
f u 11b a ck, 
handled the 
UPJ attack deftly, repeatedly booting the 
ball into safe territory.
Nonetheless, UPJ managed to surge 
through sloppy tackling into the CMU try- 
zone to make the score 6-4 late in the first 
half.

As NFL official, Rivers realizes 20-year-old dream
.„„tinued BrID page /O
•emaining cool, he didn’t believe it. “But 
(Jien the gun sounded, the hair on the 
iack of my neck stood straight up.” 
After recoveringfrom the initial shock 
\ officiating regular season college 
ames, Rivers stumbled onto his next 
liming point when he was asked to 
fficate the 1987 Peach Bowl Game be- 
iveen Tennessee and Indiana.
Jn February 1989, Rivers was notified 
‘at his application to the NFL had 
¡ached the finalist level, and he was in 
a series of rigorous, introspective 
jsts. “They send out security people 
rho go through a complete background 
ieck,” including looking over financial 
fcords, examiningpsychological stabil- 
y, and determining integrity, the most 
nportant quality in an official, said 
ivers.
Once he was notified in March that he 
as selected, Rivers then attended two 
finals clinics in the summer, one in 
an Francisco and one in Washington,
C.
Last fall, Rivers began working. There
are two possible crews to which officials 
can be assigned — regional crews, who 
stay on the west or east coast, or all­
crew, which travels all around the coun­
try officiatinggames. Rivers was assigned 
to all-crew.
Rivers took the field for his first game
— the Green Bay Packers and New York 
Jets in Milwaukee. He was slightly nerv­
ous, or as he put it more aptly, “scared as 
hell.”
The nerves gradually lessened as Riv­
ers officiated more and more games. He 
went on to work in games with the Se­
attle Seahawks, San Francisco ‘49ers, 
Philadelphia Eagles, Washington Re­
dskins, Denver Broncos, L.A. Rams, L.A. 
Raiders, Buffalo Bills, and Pittsburgh 
Steelers. Rivers has also worked ABC 
Monday Night Football games.
Remaining impartial when it comes to 
the teams can be difficult. As a native of 
Pittsburgh, Rivers was a Steelers fan, 
but he now staunchly claims every team 
intheNFLashisfavoriteteam. “Idonot 
work for the teams, I work for the league. 
We have no favorite team,” he said. No
matter who is playing, “If I see some­
thing, I have to respond to it. If a Steeler 
does something wrong, I have to respond 
to it.”
Rivers tries his best to remain incon­
spicuous and stay out of the spotlight. 
“You practice anonymity;you never want 
to be associated [with],” he said. “Offi­
cials wantthebe the most invisiblepeople 
out there.”
According to Rivers, most players 
usually keep their cool, even if they dis­
like one of his calls. “They’ll scream and 
try to intimidate you, but most of them 
know when to back away.” If a player 
gets out of hand, Rivers goes to the coach 
of the team and tells him to calm down 
his player. “And if there is still a prob­
lem, I can say I did what I could. Most 
coaches appreciate the warning.”
No matter how out of hand a player 
gets, Rivers, as the official, is still in 
charge. “I have that little yellow hanky 
at my disposal.”
The night before a game, officials 
generally spend four to six hours prepar- 
ingfor the next day. After arriving at the
city on Saturday, the officials watch films 
of games and their performances, read a 
supervisor’s critique of the previous 
week’s game, view a training tape, and 
take an exam. “We talk about our re­
sponsibility and how to handle it in the 
game tomorrow,” said Rivers. “We have 
to prepare ourselves mentally, and go 
over the do’s and don’t’s.”
Rivers works on an eight-man crew; he 
is thehead linesman. This position, which 
is at the line of scrimmage, entails look­
ing for offsides, holding, out-of-bounds, 
and monitoring the first-down markers. 
He is especially proud of his crew, as his 
crew referree went on to officiate the 
Super Bowl. Because it was his first 
year, Rivers was not eligible to officiate 
post-season games.
Once thay reach the game site, the 
crew checks over the field and then pre­
pares for a 1:03 pm kickoff time, which 
accommodates television commercials.
After a hard day at the football sta­
dium, Rivers can feel pretty satisfied 
with his earnings. One game means 
$1,100. Add that up with 18 games, four
pre-season and 14 regular season, and 
Rivers has a nice addition to his yearly 
income. “Andl’mdoingsomethingl would 
do for free,” he said.
Maintaining a respectable image for 
the officials is carefully considered by 
the NFL. Officials are not allowed to 
drink any alcohol after leaving home on 
Saturday before the game, and they can’t 
associate with “questionable” people, 
such as suspected gamblers.
Rivers remembers the funniest mo­
ment of his career so far. “Miami was 
leading Pittsburgh 14-0, and it started 
to rain until three-fourths of an inch of 
water covered the ground. All I could see 
was my head referree buried under a pile 
of players and practically drowning in 
the water.”
Rivers is planning to stick with the 
game “as long as they’ll have me.” The 
money, the travel, and the noteriety have 
nothing to do with it. He realized the 
moment he took the field in his first NFL 
game, as the crowed cheered the start of 
the game, that this was it. “It dawned on 
me that it can’t get any better,” he says.
Anderson leaves 7-year post, prompts search for new coach
continued from page 14
that,” he said.
Several of the players appeared 
disappointed that Anderson 
would not return next season. “I 
don’t want him to go,” said Dobbs.
“I’m kind of disappointed,” 
agreed sophomore Robert Sechan. 
“Larry was a great guy, and a 
great role model. He helped me in
many ways. I hate to see him go.” 
Both players felt that a new 
coach would be entering a pro­
gram on the rise. “I think if he’d 
h ad one more year, we would have 
turned the team around,” Sechan 
said. “The new guy has a strong 
situation coming in.”
Harvey felt that the affects of 
the resignation would be minor
on recruiting efforts for the next 
season. He is planning on con­
tacting all interested recruits to 
explain what has occurred.
The status of the two assistant 
coaches, Bill Kinavey arid Hart 
Anderson, is uncertain. Accord­
ing to Harvey, the new coach will 
have the ability to choose new as­
sistants.

Supp leads Tartans to fourth place in UAA indoor track finals
By SHEILA SKAFF
irtan Staffwriter
Chicago was the place to be March 3 
and 4, when the men’s and women’s 
indoor track teams took part in the third 
annual UAA championships.
Senior Captain Dave Supp led the Tar- 
fcns to a fourth place finish against top 
teams like the University of Rochester 
and Washington University. The 
women’s team also turned several strong 
p&rformances, plus school, personal, and 
ieason records.
t In the field events, freshman Abduhl- 
Efohkeem Foster finished in second place 
m the men’s longjump, with a distance of 
G.57 meters. Freshman Frank Desiderio
jumped 12.55 meters in the men’s triple 
jump, giving him a fifbh place finish. A 
season’s best performance and a fourth 
place finish were recorded by junior Jeff 
Palaima in the pole vault, when he 
cleared a height of 4.00 meters. Fresh­
men Jason Lange bettered his personal 
record to 13.36 meters in the shot put.
Coming off a sickness, junior Lisa 
Schmidt turned in a very good perform­
ance in the 400 meter run, with a time of 
1:03.44 seconds.
Foster and freshman Chris Maguire 
placed fourth and sixth respectively in 
the men’s 55 meter dash. Coach Dario 
Donetelli said he felt that their times of 
6.7 and 6.81 seconds were very strong. 
Junior Jeff Illian took fifth place in the
200 meter dash, running a season’s best 
time of 23.59 seconds.
According to Donatelli, junior Gary 
Harrison ran an excellent race in the 
men’s 800 meters, barely missing na­
tional qualification. His time of 1:55.25 
seconds earned him third place in a race 
which set a UAA record and sent two 
runners to nationals. Concerning Gary’s 
race, teamate Supp stated, “His race was 
probably the single most spectacular 
performance by a Carnegie Mellon ath­
lete at the meet.”
In the women’s 1500 meters, sopho­
more Carolyn Lowe finished sixth, with 
a time Donetelli felt was very good- 
5:05.90 minutes. In the men’s division, 
Brad Shapiro’s performance set a per­
sonal record for the freshman, finishing 
sixth in 4:05.58 minutes. Directly be­
hind him was senior Len O’Neal, who 
claimed seventh place with his time of 
4:11.19.
“This is the most tightly knit team I’ve 
ever been on. Everyone sticks together 
and cheers for each other every single 
race,” said Shapiro. “Personally, as a 
freshman I have some great role models 
to follow. Tremendous performances by 
Dave Supp and Gary Harrison help 
remind me why I run and get me fired up 
to run well in my own race.”
In the women’s 3000 meters, freshman 
Laura Sibley lead the pack, capturing a 
fifth place finish in a time of 11:11.42. 
Following Laura were junior Krisitin
Burgard, finishing seventh in 11:24.47, 
and senior Sue Johnson in nineth with a 
time of 11:32.84.
Lowe’s second race, the women’s 5000 
meters, found her even stronger than the 
first, and she created a new CMU record 
with her time of 18:42.09. This earned 
Lowe second place in the event. She was 
followed by junior Sue Sparks, who took 
tenth place in 21:05.63.
Adding to his collection of wins, Supp 
took the men’s 5000 meter race, perform- 
inghis best time of the season —15:09.45 
minutes. Also placing in the 5000 meter- 
race were sophomore Mike Damon and 
junior Todd Balbera, finishingninth and 
tenth in 15:58.09 and 16:09.38, respec­
tively.

NHL shuffles players for edge in playoff race
By MICHAEL D. C. DROUT
Tartan Staff writer
Just at the trading deadline, many 
teams made last minute transactions in 
attempts to improve their playoff hopes. 
More than half of the Patrick Division 
picked up players for the stretch run.
Pittsburgh. The Penguins picked up 
goalie Alain Chevrier from the Chicago 
Blackhawks in return for future consid­
erations. Chevrier led the Hawks to the 
division championship last year with 
superlative play in the playoffs. Before 
Chicago, he played for Vancouver and 
New Jersey.
Chevrier has been inconsistent this 
year, however, and although he has had 
experience in playingbehind a non-exis­
tent defense from his days with the 
Devils, he still may have trouble re­
adjusting to the Patrick Division. The 
Pens hope he will provide the kind of 
consistent goal-tending that has been 
missingthis season due to Tom Barasso’s 
leave of absence to be with his sick daugh­
ter.
New Jersey: The Devils traded speedy 
ReijoRuotsalienen to Edmontonforhard-
The Penguins picked up goalie Alain Chevrier* 
from the Chicago Blackhawks in return for fu­
ture considerations.
hitting defenseman Jeff Sharpies. The 
Oilers hope that Ruotsalienen can re­
gain the play of several years ago when 
he was Paul Coffey’s backup man on the 
point for Edmonton’s powerplay.
Reijo has had trouble hitting the net 
this year, however, and has had very few 
slapshots find their targets. Sharpies 
brings some size and toughness to the 
Devils.
The big trade by New Jersey, however, 
was 1986’s first round pick, defenseman 
Craig Wolanin for aging Quebec super- 
star and Czechoslovak defector Petr 
Stasny. Wolanin, 23, although labeled as 
having “unlimited potential,” has been 
inconsistent at best and clumsy at worst 
for the Devils.
The trade reunites him with his old 
defensive partner Joe Cirella and is part 
of the Nordiques move to acquire young 
players. Stasny, 30, who beat out Gretzky
for the Calder Trophy his rookie yea$ 
will most likely center the Muller/Tur- 
geon line for the Devils, who hope he .will 
provide more scoring punch.
New Jersey also traded big forward 
Jim Korn to the Calgary Flames for 
fifth round draft pick. The trade, whic>i 
seems unbalancedin favor of the Flames; 
is rumored to be only the first part of! a 
blockbuster deal that will be completed 
after the playoffs. One likely possibility 
is that New Jersey would send goalie 
Sean Burke to Calgary for goalie Ric]| 
Wamsley and either Joel Otto or Doug 
Gilmour.
New York. The Rangers traded young 
Ulf Dahlen to Minnesota for Mike Gart­
ner. Gartner, who won the speed skating 
contest at the All-Star Game, bring^ 
speed, toughness, and an excellent slap­
shot to the Rangers.

stood at 3-3 at the end of the first 
period. Beta’s offense began to 
heat up, and the Bouncers took 
hold of the game in the second 
quarter. Tornes scored five of 
Beta’s nine second-quarter points 
to push the Bouncers to a 12-7 
halftime lead.
The third quarter saw very little 
scoring, as Beta outscored ASA 
4-3, but one of Beta’s baskets 
turned out to be the biggest of the 
game. Sophomore Doug Stauffer 
hit a basket as time ran out which 
gave Beta a 16-10 lead, but more 
importantly, seemed to give new 
momentum to the Bouncers, who 
ran away with the game in the 
final period. ASA’s fouls accounted 
for eight of Beta’s last 10 points as 
the Bouncers iced the minors title.
The women-only championship 
Detween Volleyball Et A1 and 
Gerri’s Kids turned out to be the 
Diggest blowout of the evening. 
Volleyball got out to an early 6—3 
ead, but its luck then turned sour 
with a vengeance. Junior co-MVP 
tiara Narath, who led the Kids 
with 13 points, hit three straight 
Daskets to start a 24-point Gerri’s 
Sids run. By the time Volleyball 
got back on the scoreboard, the 
game was well into the third 
quarter, and Volleyball was in a 
27-6 hole.
The third quarter ended with 
the Kids ahead, 33-10, and the 
only sign of hope for Volleyball 
was that Kids’ senior Val 
iwiatkowski, who shared MVP 
lonors with Narath, was out of
action due to an injury suffered 
early in the third quarter. How­
ever, Volleyball scored the first 
five points in the last quarter, 
and it seemed as if it might have 
a chance. Unfortunately, there 
wasn’t enough clock left for Vol­
leyball to get back into the game, 
and the Kids went on a 9-2 run at 
the end to provide the final mar­
gin of victory.
The intermediate championship 
between Run-SAE and Beta 
WPHA turned out to be the most 
exciting game of the evening. 
Sophomore Mike Warren only 
scored one point in the game, but 
that foul shot with 1:02 lefl gave 
SAE a 34-33 lead.
The first half was a game of 
momentum; SAE held the upper 
hand in the first quarter, and 
Beta dominated the second. In 
the first quarter, SAE freshman 
Chad Brown scored seven straight 
points to give SAE an 8-4 lead. 
Brown would lead SAE with. 13 
points and would be named as the
game’s MVP. In the second pe­
riod, Beta, led by sophomore Bob 
Fasy, would go on an 11—3 run to 
take a 15-11 halftime lead. Fasy 
would score a game-high 16 
points, in cludingfourthree-point- 
ers.
The third quarter was an even 
battle most of the way, but Beta 
pulled ahead late in the period. 
Fasy and senior Dave Skinner hit 
three-pointers late in the third, 
and Fasy added another early in 
the fourth to give Beta a 29-25 
lead.
The Beta lead, which would 
climb as high as five points, dis­
appeared with 1:27 left as SAE 
freshman Scott Mills buried a 
three-pointer, the only one SAE 
would hit in the second half. 
Warren hit thegame-winningfree 
throw 26 seconds later, and SAE 
held off Beta’s comeback attempt 
which included, ironically, a 
missed three-pointer by Fasy.
After a trophy ceremony honor­
ing winners of previously com­
pleted IM sports, the evening 
closed with the majors champion­
ship between ATO and Up & In. 
Up & In would lead by as much as 
16 points in the game, but ATO 
refused to give up and was within 
three points when time expired. 
The final score was 52-49.
Up & In jumped out to an early 
lead behind the shooting of game 
MVP Tony Nelson. Nelson, who 
was also the MVP of the IM All- 
Star game, scored 27 points, in­
cluding four three-pointers. ATO 
came right back with a seven- 
point run that carried over into 
the second quarter, making the 
score 13-9 in favor of ATO. Late 
in the half, Up & In responded 
with a five-point run of its own 
that made the score 14-13 in its 
favor, but ATO junior Don Decaro 
closed out the first half with a 
game-tying free throw.
The third quarter saw ATO’s 
offense take a sharp turn for the 
worse, and Up & In took full ad­
vantage. Up & In doubled its 
points in the third quarter while 
ATO only put five points on the 
board, and, at the end of the third 
quarter, Up & In held a com­
manding 28-19 lead. At the start 
of the fourth quarter, things only 
got worse for ATO as Up & In fin­
ished a 12-point run to make the 
lead 35-19.
ATO finally received.its second 
half wake-up call when senior 
Dean Garofola hit three straight 
baskets in less than one minute. 
From that point on, ATO played 
its best basketball of the day but
was unable to chop further into 
the Up & In lead. However, with 
2:27 left, senior Steve Calfo hit a 
three-pointer to spark a 10-point 
ATO run that made it 46-43 with
less than two minutes left. Unfor­
tunately for ATO, it had to start 
fouling to regain the ball and was 
unable to even the score beiorf 
time expired.

2IycCyda1 BrID JMka /’
As in the Nicholls trade, it 
appears that New York got the 
lest of the deal, since Dahlen has 
lever achieved the potential he 
vas hyped for when he entered 
he league.
¦The Rangers hope that Gart- 
jer,whohasscored70-plus points 
nd 30-plus goals each of his sea- 
onsin the NHL will help them to 
et out ofthe mediocre Patrick di- 
jsion.
Washington. The Caps traded 
¡ugh Ivan Corriveau to Hartford 
¡r goalie Mike Liut. Liut, before 
eing injured earlier this year, 
ad the second best goals against 
verage and save percentage in
the league and leads all active 
goaltenders with 14 shutouts.
It appears that he was traded 
from the Whalers due to both in­
consistency since returning from 
his injury and to remove his very 
expensive contract from the 
Whaler’s payroll.
Philadelphia. In the second 
bad trade with the Bruins in less 
than a month, Flyer’s general 
manager Bobby Clarke sent for­
mer captain Brian Propp to the 
Boston Bruins for a second round 
draft pick. Propp is paired on 
penalty killing with his old part­
ner Dave Poulin, previously 
traded to the Bruins for Ken Lin-
The motivation behind this 
trade is not clear, as Propp, al­
though old, seems worth more 
than a second round pick. Some 
speculate that a considerable 
amount of cash was a part of the 
deal.
Chicago. The Blackhawks 
traded youngsters Everett Sani- 
pass and Daniel Vincelette plus 
draft picks to Quebec for goalie 
Greg Millen and superstar Michel 
Goulet.
The Hawks now appear poised 
to capture the division title and 
give the Smythe division winner 
a run for the money in the semifi­
nals.
St. Louis. The Blues traded
Adrian Plavsic and a first and 
second round draft pick to Van­
couver for winger Rich Sutter and 
defenseman Harold Snepsts.
Snepsts, a fan and player favor­
ite in Vancouver, is believed to 
have been included in the trade to 
give him one more chance to 
appear in the playoffs before he 
retires. The Blues hope Snepsts 
will provide leadership for their 
playoff run.
Montreal. The Canadians 
traded Finnish Rikki Lumme to 
Vancouver for a second round 
draft pick.
Teams in Smythe Division 
clinch playoff spots. The Cal­
gary Flames, the Edmonton Oil­
ers and the Winnipeg Jets all are 
assured of a playoff spot. The 
Vancouver Canucks and the Los 
Angeles Kings, the other two 
teams in the division, are battling 
for the fourth place. Los Angeles 
currently has a slight edge over 
Vancouver in the race for the play­
offs.
Race down to the wire in 
PatrickDivision. With all teams 
in the Patrick having more than 
ten games left, and only ten points 
separating first and last place, 
anything can happen.
The New York Islanders are 
sliding, the Rangers playingfairly 
solidly, the Flyers and Capitals 
unable to put a string of wins to­
gether, and the Penguins and 
Devils brilliant one night, incom­
petent the next.
All of the teams have similar 
schedules for the rest of the sea­
son. Hot goaltending, a scoring 
streak, or the success of one ofthe 
big trades will make the differ­
ence between playoffs and an early 
golf break.
The real question is whether 
teams wish to compete for first or 
fourth. Since the end of the 
Islander’s dynasty, the team that 
has finished fourth in the Patrick 
in the regular season has won the 
Division title in the playoffs. 
Maybe the fight should be for 
fourth, not first.
Jockey wraps up season at Belmont Invitational

¿The CMU hockey team finished 
¡season last weekend with play 
the Belmont Invitational 
iiirneament.
Also featured in this toume- 
ent were Duquesne University, 
niversity of Cincinnati, and 
iversity of Delaware.
On Saturday, the Tartans took 
a strong Delaware team and 
fct 5-1, while Cincinnati lost to 
Duquesne 6—3. In the consolation 
jbund on Sunday, CMU lost to 
5elaware 6—3. Duquesne went on 
» beat Delaware by three goals in 
te finals later Sunday afternoon. 
In Sunday’s action, the Tartans 
iundthemselvestrailingCincin- 
iti by three goals at the end of

e strong goaltending of senior 
ihn Kerber, the deficit would 
e been larger. Delaware out- 
ihot CMU 15—8 in the first pe-
Knight is true to form as Purdue stomps Indiana
riod, and 40—27 overall.
CMU and Cincinnati matched 
goals for the rest of the game, but 
the Tartans could never overcome 
the initial three goal disadvan­
tage. The Tartans retaliated in 
the secondperiodbyscoringtwice 
to bring the Tartans to within one 
goal.
Junior interim tri-captain Craig 
Palli started the scoring with 
10:36 remainingwhen he snapped 
in a rebound from a slapshot taken 
by GSIA grad Ed Pike. H&SS 
grad Dick Hanson scored from 
the top of the faceoff circle with 
6:39 remaining as he drove in a 
feed from sophomore Jan-Marc 
Featherston. With 45 seconds 
remaining in the period, Cincin­
nati scored twice to again extend 
its lead to three goals.
The third period was more de­
fensive than the first two as both 
teams took only nine shots apiece. 
Sophomore Dave Sealfon, theback 
up CMU goaltender for Sunday’s
game, dressed as a forward and 
netted theTartan’s third andfinal 
goal. Junior Darin Dunham 
dumped the puck into the Cinci- 
nati comer. GSIA grad Mike Ples- 
che beat a Cincinnati defender to 
the puck and passed it to Sealfon 
who beat the Cincinnatti goalie.
Saturday, the Tartans got onto 
the scoreboard first as Plesche 
scored unassited when he batted 
in his own rebound from inside 
the Delaware crease. Plesche had 
one goal and one assist during the 
Belmont Invitational to lead the 
Tartans in scoring.
Delaware scored with 3:04 re­
maining to even the score at the 
end of the first period. Delaware 
then scored twice in the second 
period and twice in the third 
period to win the game 5-1. Seal­
fon started in goal for the Tartans 
and was outstanding as he 
stopped 39 of 44 Delaware shots.
The Tartans lost to Duquesne 
in exhibition play last Thursday
as the Dukes won 6-1. The Tar­
tans had jumped out to an early 
lead when sophomore Ed Kilduff 
hid behind a larger Duke defense­
man and fired a blistering slap­
shot into the net from 40 feet out. 
The goalie, screened by his own 
man, did not see Kilduff wind up 
and did not even move as the puck 
went by him. Duquesne then score 
six unanswered goals as it out- 
shot CMU 31-13.
Graduating this May will be 
right wing Chris Galvin, defense­
man Ed Pike, right wing Adam 
Dermarderosian, left wing Paul 
Martinchich, center Todd Hen­
derson, goaltender John Kerber, 
and defensive captain Mark Rob­
son.
Freshman left wing Mike Gallin 
will probably be out for the 1990- 
1991 season but will return once 
the plate is removed from his 
collarbone. Center right wing 
Randy Walter will be in Switzer­
land on the EPFL exchange.

BASKETBALL’S 
BASEMENT
by Randy Hilfman
Tech dropped their 15th straight, 
Floridaits 14th. In along-awaited 
matchup of Basement residents, 
Duquesne thumped St. Joseph’s, 
82-71.
Loyola-Marymount set an 
NCAA record with its 24th game 
over 100 points this season. In a 
key matchup in the West, UNLV 
axed Arizona, 95-87. Coaches 
Jerry Tarkanian and “Midnight
Lute” Olson, who Tark claims 
stole players from him, despise 
each other, and their series will 
likely be dropped.

Musselman’s Timberwolves win

City soccer tournament axed
A proposed citywide college 
soccer tournament, which was to 
include CMU, was pushed back to 
the 1991 preseason last week. The 
tournament, proposed by Robert 
MorrisSoccerCoach John Kowal­
ski almost a month ago, was cre­
ated as a means of promoting 
soccer in the Pittsburgh area and 
had been planned for the upcom­
ing season. CMU and the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh both expressed 
interest in the idea, but schedules 
for the 1990 season had already 
been finalized by the time the 
proposal was on the table.
In addition, the three coaches 
were unable to come up with a
fourth college to take part. Ac­
cording to Kowalski, Point Park, 
the early favorite, had to drop out 
because it is currently without a 
coach, and Duquesne and LaRo- 
che, two other area schools, 
wouldn’t be up to the level of the 
other teams. Duquesne’s soccer 
program is only at the club level, 
while LaRoche will be playing at 
the varsity level for the first time 
next season.
The choices were so limited that 
the coaches considered offering 
entry to Penn State, citing the 
fact that many PSU almni live in 
the Pittsburgh area.
Thetoumamenthas tentatively 
been scheduled for the Labor Day 
weekend in 1991, pending the
ment.

Entries for indoor soccer are 
due on Thursday, March 22. Play

How Patsy Cline Ended Two of my Relationships
At a party the first time, and later
in the park, her words stuck
in the floating moments as the light faded
her voice louder than firecrackers.
I couldn’t pretend she was singing 
for anyone else, the snarls and breaks
in the music that form a rhythm of life.
The couples down there don’t need 
words. The silence lasts. I’m almost sure
there is no language—176 radio stations 
leave room for an occasional growl, nothing 
more. I never want to listen and always do.
I buy country albums full of tangles
rather than risk forgetting what I know. Nashville
is a town where people have made
love for years without me. Patsy Cline 
recorded I Fall to Pieces one November 
afternoon at the Grand Old Opry with the echo
of piss contradicting the screams and applause.
If I had just one afternoon I’d take a picture 
of the stage, empty with her voice.

WAS AWESOME. EAEN THEN DID SOMETHING THAT 
SURPRISED US ALL HE TOLD HER HE WANTED A 
VIRGIN. HE STOOD UP AND WALKED AWAY!
FIONA BEGAN TO TRY TO CATCH UP TO HIM, BUT 
SHE FAILED. THAT LEFT ME AND DONALD ALONE 
TO LAUGH HYSTERICALLY! THEN DONALD 
LOOKED AT ME SERIOUSLY AND ASKED ME, "HAVE 
YOU EVER HAD SEX?"
I WASNT SURE WHAT TO ANSWER SO I SAID, 
“IT'S FOR ME TO KNOW AND YOU NEVER TO FIND 
OUT." AND THEN I BEGAN TO LAUGH UNTIL MY 
EYES BEGAN TO WATER. HE HAD NO IDEA WHY I 
WAS LAUGHING, NEITHER DID I! ITWAS WEIRD.
THEN I SAID, "DONALD, LET'S MAKE WILD 
PASSIONATE LOVE RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW," 
WHICH MADE HIM LAUGH. AFTER THAT, HE 
CHANGED THE SUBJECT. WE WENT AND SAW 
RAINMAN WHICH WAS REALLY GOOD. AFTER THE 
MOVIES, WE WENT OUR SEPARATE WAYS.
DONALD CALLED LATER THAT SAME NIGHT. 
HE TOLD ME THAT FIONA CALLED EAEN AND TOLD 
HIM TO MEET HER AT NEWCASTLE BEACH. HE SAID 
WE SHOULD GO, TOO.
WHILE RUMMAGING THROUGH MY CLOSETS 
TO FIND SOMETHING TO WEAR. MY MOM CALLED 
ME DOWN FOR ANOTHER PHONE CALL. ITWAS 
FIONA. SHE CALLED AND TOLD ME THAT SHE 
CALLED EAEN AND TO BRING DONALD AND MEET 
HER DOWN AT THE BEACH. BEING THE GREAT 
ACTRESS THAT I AM, I TOLD HER I THOUGHT SHE 
WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING, AND THAT I WOULD 
BE THERE IN A HALF HOUR. MY PARENTS LEFT ME 
OFF AT THE BEACH. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE 
BECAUSE, IN ORDER TO GETTHE RIDE, I HAD TO BE 
TEN MINUTES EARLY, BUT, HEY, ITS BETTER THAN 
WALKING.
DONALD KNOCKED ME DOWN IN THE SAND, 
THEN WE STARTED TO FIGHT. I TOLD HIM IT WAS 
JUST LIKE HAVING A SNOW BATTLE IN MY GOOD 
OLD HOME TOWN. WE WALKED BACK TO THE MAIN 
ENTRANCE. EAEN WAS THERE AND WAITING. IT 
WAS THEN THAT IT HIT ME WHAT WE MUST HAVE 
BEEN PUTTING THIS KID TROUGH, SO I ASKED HIM 
ABOUT IT AND HE SAID HE REALLY DIDN'T MIND AS 
LONG AS IJ DIDNT TAKE LONG. FIONA WALKED IN. 
SHE CAME BOUNCING DOWN AND ASKED IF HER 
AND EAEN COULD BE ALONE. AFTER THEY WENT 
OFF, IT WAS JUST ME AND DONALD.
WHILE SITTING THERE, I REALIZED HOW 
LITTLE I KNEW ABOUT THIS KID. I MEAN, WHAT 
WERE HIS DREAMS? WHAT DID HE WANT TO DO 
WITH HIS LIFE? WHY DID HE FIND ME ATTRACTIVE? I 
COULD TELL HIM WHY I FOUND HIM ATTRACTIVE,
HE WAS AWESOME! SO I ASKED, WHICH TOOK A 
LOT OF COURAGE OUT OF ME, I ASKED HIM, I SAID, 
"WHY ME?”
HE SAID, "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? 
I'LL TELL YOU, YOU YANKEES MY NO SENSE."
I THREW HIM IN THE SAND. BUT BEING 
THAT HE WAS STRONGER, HE GOT ON ME! HE 
PROCEEDED TO LOOK INTO MY EYES, AND THEN 
HE CLOSED HIS EYES, WHICH MEANT HE WAS 
GOING TO KISS ME! I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. HE 
KISSED ME, BUT MY MIND WAS SPINNING, AND I 
MISSED IT! MY FIRST IMPORTANT KISS, AND I 
MISSED IT! WHEN I FINALLY OPENED MY EYES, HE 
WAS LOOKING RIGHT IN THEM QUITE SERIOUSLY. I 
ASKED,"WHAT? WASN'T IT GOOD ENOUGH?"--------
“WHY? WASN'T ALL THAT YOU EXPECTED 
AND WANTED?” HE ASKED.
I SAID, "WHY DID YOU LOOK SO SERIOUS?"
"BECAUSE," HE SAID, “I'VE NEVER EXPERI­
ENCED A KISS THAT EXCITING."
WELL, I HAD TO LAUGH AFTER THAT STATE­
MENT. I DIDN'T KNOW WHATTO SAY EXCEPT, "IF IT 
WAS THAT GOOD, LET'S DO IT AGAIN."
SO WE DID, AND THIS TIME I KNEW WHAT 
WAS GOING ON, AND IT WAS EXCITING. AND IT WAS 
WONDERFUL. WE DREW APART AFTER A FEW 
MINUTES TO HEAR THE SOBS FROM FIONA. I 
FORGOT TOTALLY ABOUT HER. I FELT REALLY 
BAD! SHE MUST OF GONE THROUGH A LOT. I 
ASKED WHAT HAPPENED. SHE SAID SHE DIDNT 
WANTTO TALK. I RAN UP TO EAEN AND ASKED HIM 
WHAT HE DID. HE SAID THAT HE DIDN'T DO 
ANYTHING EXCEPT TELL THAT HEWASNOTIN 
LOVE WITH HER. OH WELL, ALL'S FAIR IN LOVE.
DONALD AND I SPENT THE REST OF THE 
NIGHT WALKING AROUND TOWN. WE DIDN'T DO 
MUCH, WE JUST WENT AROUND AND EXPLORED.
WE WENT EVERYWHERE. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.
HE SHOWED ME THINGS THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW 
WERE IN NEWCASTLE. HE SHOWED ME WHERE HE 
USED TO HANG OUT WHEN HE WAS A BOY. AFTER 
A WHILE, WE ENDED UP ON THE BEACH AGAIN 
RIGHT WHERE OUR EVENING BEGAN.
WE SAT DOWN WHERE WE SAT BEFORE.
AND HE TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE 
"OUR" SPOT NOW. EVERY TIME HE WOULD GO TO 
THIS BEACH, HE SAID HE WOULD THINK OF ME. IT 
WAS A REALLY NICE THING TO SAY CONSIDERING 
THAT I ONLY HAD LESS THAN THREE MONTHS OF 
SCHOOL IN AUSTRAILIA, THEN I'D BE GONE FOR­
EVER. I TOLD HIM HOW MUCH FUN I HAD THAT 
EVENING AND HOW I WISHED THAT ALL OUR TIMES 
COULD BE LIKE THIS. DONALD TOLD ME THAT HE 
WAS SURPRISED AT WHAT I SAID. HE THOUGHT I 
REALLY DIDNT LIKE HIM THAT MUCH. IN A WAY, 
THAT'S HOW I WANTED TO COME OFF AT FIRST,
NOT LETTING HIM KNOW MY TRUE FEELINGS 
BECAUSE, IF HE DID, HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE 
THOUGHT HE COULD CONTROL MY LIFE
WE LAID ON THE SAND TALKING UNTIL HE 
FINALLY TOOK ME INTO HIS ARMS AND KISSED ME 
EVER SO GENTLY ON THE LIPS. HE PROCEEDED TO 
TRY TO DO OTHER THINGS, AND BEING CAUGHT UP 
IN THE MOMENT, I LET HIM . IT WASN'T UNTIL HE 
TRIED TO DO SOMETHING ELSE THAT I STOPPED 
HIM. HE TOLD ME HE UNDERSTOOD, THAT WE 
JUST STARTED GOING OUT AND THAT HE WAS 
PROBABLY GOING TOO QUICK.
WE WALKED HOME HAND IN HAND.
DONALD TOLD ME ABOUT HIS OTHER RELATION­
SHIPS WITH GIRLS AND HOW HE ALWAYS CAME 
OFF AS THE JERK. I COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT 
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE WHEN WE FIRST 
STARTED GOING OUT, I DON’T KNOW HOW MANY 
PEOPLE AT SCHOOL TOLD ME THAT HE WAS TOO 
FAST FOR ME. AS IF READING MY MIND DONALD 
SAID, "I BET A LOT OF KIDS AT SCHOOL HAVE BEEN 
GIVING YOU SOME SLACK BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING 
OUT WITH ME.”
I ANSWERED HIM TRUTHFULLY. I SAID,
“YEA, SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID SOME THINGS TO 
ME, BUT I DONT CARE. THEY DON'T SEE YOU THE 
WAY I DO."
HE ASKED, “HOW DO YOU SEE ME?"
I ANSWERED HIM AS TRUTHFULLY AS I 
COULD, “I SEE YOU AS A BOY WHO WANTS TO 
GROW UP, BUT YET SOMETHING WON'T LET HIM.”

There’s a rumor going around the Creative Writing Department: Michael Curtis' favorite way to read fiction for Harper’s Monthly is 
by turning the Celtics game on. Apparently, Mr. Curtis sits with a stack of submissions on his lap and reads through the first paragraphs. Only 
if the writing distracts him from the game does he continue to read. “Make your first sentence worthy of your death,” Gordon Lish has said,
and it seems more than an aesthetic principle here, it’s a commercial reality.
immicks That 
Have Never Failed
( -/zu so;
For Dossier's 10th Anniversary, I thought I’d publish the first paragraphs of stories that have appeared in the past issues the magazine, 
and we could all learn something about shooting out of the gate. I was going to say some things about tension, mystery—you know, opening 
up worlds of possibility. But I was surprised to discover that strict guidelines already existed for Dossier fiction. Honestly, the previous 
literary editor told me nothing about the formula.
I am often asked what kinds of things Dossier publishes, and I have lied all year. I’ve been saying things like, “Anything good.” To 
make amends, a updated guide, complete with illustrations from a decade of Dossier, follows.

TODAY, WE MIGHT NOT HAVE EVER GOTTEN 
TOGETHER."
IN SAYING THIS, IT SHOWED HIM HOW 
MUCH I CARED FOR HIM.
DONALD SAID, "REBECCA," HE NEVER DID 
CALL ME BECKY, AND I NEVER CALLED HIM DON, 
"SOME BLIND FAITH BROUGHT US TOGETHER 
TODAY. WE WERE MEANTTO BE."
I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T CARE, AND FIONA WAS 
GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. I FINALLY HAD DONALD 
SEE THINGS MY WAY, AND HE TOLD ME HE WOULD 
HELP ME GET BACK AT HER EVEN THOUGH HE 
DIDNT REALLY AGREE.
WHEN WE REACHED MY DOOR, I COULD 
TELL NOONE WAS HOME. I INVITED HIM IN. HE 
SAID THAT HE WAS ALREADY LATE. HE THEN GAVE 
ME A QUICK KISS ON THE LIPS AND RAN OFF INTO 
THE DISTANCE. I HAD TO ADMIT, I WANTED MORE 
THAN A QUICK KISS BUT, HEY, THIS GUY WOULD 
NOT BE PRESSURING ME INTO SEX. BOY WAS I 
WRONG.
INSIDE, I REALIZED HOW HUNGRY I WAS AND 
THEN I ATE MYSELF INTO A FRENZY.
THE NEXT DAY AT SCHOOL, WE WERE 
EVERYWHERE TOGETHER, AND STILL DONALD'S X- 
GIRLFRIEND GAVE US DIRTY LOOKS. HER FRIENDS 
KEPT HARASSING ME, AND MY FRIENDS KEPT 
TELLING ME HE WAS NO GOOD FOR ME, BUT ALL 
AND ALL, IT WAS A GOOD DAY.
EVERY TIME I WENT TO A CLASS, HE WAS BY 
MY SIDE. I FELT TRULY HAPPY AROUND HIM. IT 
WAS HARD NOT TO YELL AT FIONA. SEE, IF I 
YELLED AT HER, SHE WOULD KNOW THAT I KNEW 
ABOUT WHAT SHE TOLD DONALD, BUT IT WAS 
FUNNY WHEN ME AND DONALD WERE WALKING 
OUT PAST THE COURTYARD, AND SHE SAW US 
HAND IN HAND. HER FACE GREW RED WITH 
ANGER. I HAD TO BE POLITE, OR IT WOULD RUIN 
OUR PLAN TO GET HER BACK. I KNOW THAT 
REVENGE ISN'T ALWAYS THE BEST THING, BUT 
BOY. WAS IT SWEET. ME AND DONALD'S PLAN 
WASNT REALLY ALL THAT INVOLVED. BUT I KNEW 
IT WOULD GET HER GOOD.
I ASKED BEN IF HE WOULD PRETEND THAT 
HE LIKED FIONA FOR A FEW DAYS. HE SAID THAT 
HE COULDNT BECAUSE THEY DESPISED EACH 
OTHER TOO MUCH AND THAT SHE WOULD KNOW 
RIGHT AWAY IT WAS A BIG JOKE. HE WAS RIGHT. 
EVERY TIME I SAWTHETWO OFTHEMTOGETHER, 
THEY WERE FIGHTING. THIS GUY, EAEN, WAS 
SITTING NEARBY WHEN I ASKED BEN. EAEN AND 
DONALD WERE BEST FRIENDS AND STILL ARE.
JUST WHEN I WAS GOING TO TELL DONALD THAT 
BEN AND HER WOULDNT WORK OUT, EAEN SAID 
THAT HE WOULD DO IT, WHICH WAS VERY NICE 
CONSIDERING I BARELY KNEW EAEN. I ASKED HIM 
IF HE KNEW FIONA. HE SAID THAT HE DIDNT. THAT 
WAS THE BEAUTY OF IT—IF HE DIDN'T KNOW HER,
HE WOULDNT HATE HER, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE 
WHO KNEW FIONA. ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS LET 
FIONA KNOW THAT EAEN LIKED HER, AND EVERY­
THING WAS SET. IF EAEN EVER DECIDES TO BE AN 
ACTOR, WATCH OUT DUSTIN HOFFMAN!
EAEN STARTED TALKING TO FIONA. HE 
ASKED HER TO GO TO MCDONALD'S WERE THEY 
COULD ENJOY BURGERS AND FRIES, THEN GO TO 
THE MOVIES. SHE TOLD HIM SHE COULD NOT 
MAKE IT THAT DAY BUT WOULD BE HAPPY TO GO 
WITH HIM THE NEXT.
FIONA WOULD NOT STOP TALKING ABOUT 
EAEN. EAEN IS CUTE AND ALL BUT HE WAS PRETTY 
BAD. I MEAN, HE WAS ONE OF MANY SCHOOL 
DRUG DEALERS. FIONA MADE ME COMETO HER 
HOUSE TO HELP HER PICK OUT WHATTO WEAR. 
AFTER WHAT SEEMED LIKE HOURS, SHE DECIDED 
ON THIS PRETTY NICE OUTFIT. I HAVE TO ADMIT 
SHE DIDNT LOOK HALF BAD WHEN SHE WAS DONE 
GROOMING HERSELF.
I GRABBED SOMETHING TO EAT AT 
MCDONALD'S WHILE FIONA WENT LOOKING FOR 
EAEN. SHE REPORTED TO ME THAT HE WASNT 
THERE YET. I TOLD HER THAT I HAD TO LEAVE 
BECAUSE I HAD TO GO TO THE LIBRARY TO DO MY 
SCIENCE REPORT THAT WAS DUE THE NEXT DAY. I 
WENT TO THE LIBRARY AND SPENT TWO HOURS ON 
MY STUPID SCIENCE REPORT.
I DECIDED TO MAKE A QUICK STOP AT 
MCDONALD'S ON MY WAY HOME. I WENT INSIDE TO 
SEE FIONA STILL SITTING IN THE SAME SEAT AS 
WHEN I LEFT HER. AND I THINK SHE WAS STILL IN 
THE SAME POSITION. SHE HEARD SOMEONE 
WALKING TOWARDS HER. TURNED AROUND, SAW 
IT WAS ME AND CONTINUED TO STARE OUT THE 
WINDOW WAITING FOR THE "LOVE” OF HER LIFE. I 
FELT SORRY FOR HER THEN. I TOLD HER TO GO 
HOME AND THAT HE PROBABLY WAS AT THE 
OTHER MCDONALD'S WAITING. SHE SAID SURE.
I COULDNT GET FIONA'S ATTENTION ON THE 
WAY HOME. SHE KEPT STARING AT THE ENTRANCE 
TO MCDONALD'S EVEN WHEN WE WERE SO FAR 
AWAY THAT YOU COULD BARELY SEE THE TALL 
McDONALD'SSIGN.
WE REACHED MY HOUSE FIRST. BEFORE I 
COULD SAY ANYTHING, FIONA BLURTED OUT, 
"EAEN MUST HAVE A REAL GOOD REASON."
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, SHE MUST REALLY 
BE FALLING FOR HIM. I MEAN, WE ALL HAD IT 
PLANNED THAT EAEN WOULDN'T SHOW UP, BUT I 
FIGURED SHE'D WAIT TEN MINUTES AND LEAVE. 
FIONA DIDNT SEEM THE TYPE TO REALLY CARE 
ABOUT BOYS. BUT SHE DID, AND IT WAS APPAR- 
ENTTHAT SHE LIKED EAEN. I TOLD HER THAT I 
WOULD SEE HER TOMORROW, AND I WENT INSIDE. 
AFTER A LATE DINNER, I RODE MY BIKE AROUND 
THE BEACHES. IT FELT GOOD TO RIDE MY BIKE AT

6. Boys driving
cars are always way cool
Fred hadn't said anything for the past 
four of five miles; he Just stared ahead, 
his blue-veined hands gripping the 
wheel, hardly moving as the car crawled 
along the vast and bland stretch of 
highway. Bonnie found the sllcnce 
oppressive, but Fred wouldn't have the 
11-___Vi/> liras ririvinii:
8. Swear
10. If all else fails, be oblique
The front door slammed five times. VI 
sat down on a stool at the kitchen 
counter— relieved because she was 
alone. The kitchen was a mess. Four 
bowls had been set on the table hours 
earlier, all of them dirty with soggy Fruit 
Loops. She picked up the bowls and a 
plate with dried egg on It, and placed 
them in the left hand side of the double 
sink. Dirty glasses lined the length of 
the counter. She was unwilling to put 
effort into cleaning and grabbed for her 
pack of cigarettes. It was empty. She 
looked around the room, and in the 
cabinet next to the kitchen table she 
caught a glimpse of the comer of an 
open carton. She remembered that her 
husband took the last pack from that 
carton when he left. “Damn! Now I have 
to go out and buy more. I can’t believe 
this. It’s Just not going to be my year. I 
know it. .

---------------------------------------------------

HE MUST OF LIKED ME BECAUSE HE KNEW MY 
SCHEDULE BETTER THEN I DID. AS SOON AS I 
FINALLY FELT COMFORTABLE WITH HIM, MY 
"FRIEND," FIONA, INTERRUPTED US. THAT BITCH! 
FIONA'S ANOTHER STORY. I COULD WRITE A BOOK 
ABOUT HER, BUT I'D BORE MY READERS TO DEATH. 
(NOT THAT I AM NOT ALREADY!) I HAD TO LEAVE 
WITH FIONA AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO DONALD, BUT 
WHILE DOING SO, DONALD ASKED FOR MY PHONE 
NUMBER. I GAVE IT TO HIM GRACIOUSLY, BEING 
THE SANE PERSON THAT I AM. THAT EVENING, 
AFTER SCHOOL, WHILE MAKING COFFEE FOR MY 
MOTHER, HE CALLED. EVERYTHING WAS GOING 
PRETTY BAD , BUT THEN IT WENT FROM BAD TO 
WORSE—I DROPPED THE PHONE! I'VE NEVER 
BEEN SO HUMILIATED IN MY LIFE! AND AFTER 
THAT. OUR RELATIONSHIP REALLY WENT DOWN 
HILL.
WELL, WE WERE GOING TO THE SCHOOL 
DANCE THAT NEXT WEDNESDAY. I DIDN'T TALK TO 
HIM AT SCHOOL MUCH AFTER THAT CALL, BUT I 
STILL PRESUMED WE WERE GOING TO GO TO THE 
DANCE TOGETHER.WHEN THE DANCE FINALLY 
CAME, I DRESSED WITH CARE .
I DIDN'T SEE DONALD WHEN I GOT TO THE 
DANCE, SO I JUST STARTED DANCING AROUND 
WITH MY FRIENDS, BUT I COULD NOT STOP MY 
EYES FROM WANDERING AROUND TO LOOK FOR 
HIM. THAT WAS WHEN I REALIZED HOW MUCH I 
LIKED THIS GUY. I MEAN. AT FIRST, YES, I 
THOUGHT HE WAS AWESOME, BUT, I MEAN, NOW I 
THINK I REALLY WAS FALLING FOR HIM.
BEN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID, “YOUR 
BUDDY, DONALD, IS HERE."
"OH," I SAID, "REALLY? I HAVENT SEEN HIM."
"THAT'S BECAUSE, AS OF NOW, HE'S 
GETTING THE SHIT KICKED OUT OF HIM FOR 
COMING TO THE DANCE DRUNK."
I WAS REALLY MAD. I WAS NOT USED THAT 
SORT OFTHING. DONALD DIDNT SEEM LIKE THE 
THE TYPE OF KID TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I 
WASNT GOING TO LET HIM RUIN THE REST OF MY 
NIGHT BY THINKING ABOUT IT, BUT I DID.
THE NEXT DAY AT SCHOOL. I WASN'T SURE 
WHAT I WOULD SAY IF I SAW HIM. WE WEREN'T 
GOING OUT, SO WHY SHOULD IT MATTER TO ME 
WHAT HE DID WITH HIS LIFE? OH, THERE'S ONE 
MORE THING I FORGOT TO TELL YA. AFTER I 
TALKED TO DONALD ON THE PHONE AND AGREED 
TO GO WITH HIM TO THE DANCE. HE BROKE UP 
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. SHE HAD BEEN GIVING ME 
THE LOOK OF DEATH AT THE DANCE.
DONALD DID NOT TALK TO ME ALL WEEK. I 
DECIDED TO TAKE MATTERS INTO MY OWN HAND. 
AFTER SCHOOL, I LOOKED UP HIS ADDRESS IN THE 
PHONE BOOK AND SAW THAT HE LIVED IN RIDING 
DISTANCE ON MY BIKE. MY PARENTS WERE OUT 
FOR THE EVENING, SO 1 DIDN'T HAVE TO BE HOME
FOR DINNER. I GATHERED UP MY I.N.X.S. SHIRT 
AND TAPE AND RODE OFF ON MY BIKE IN HOPES 
TO FIND DONALD. WHEN I FINALLY REACHED HIS 
STREET, I DIDNT SEE ANYTHING, SO I RODE A 
LITTLE FURTHER. AT THE END OF HIS STREET, I 
SAW A BOY WALKING IN THE DISTANCE WITH A 
SURF BOARD. I DIDNT THINK IT COULD BE 
DONALD BECAUSE HE DIDNT SEEM LIKE THE TYPE 
TO SURF, BUT THEN THE BOY TURNED HIS HEAD, 
AND I KNEW IT WAS DONALD. I GUESS MY I.N.X.S. 
TAPE THAT WAS BLARING IN MY EARS INSPIRED 
ME, I CALLED OUT HIS NAME. AT FIRST, HE 
STOPPED AS IFSOMEONE SLAPPED HIM ACROSS 
THE FACE, THEN HE SLOWLY TURNED HIS HEAD 
AROUND, SAW IT WAS ME, GAVE A SNIDE SMILE 
AND CONTINUED TO WALK. I ALMOST DIED. I 
DIDNT KNOW WHATTO DO, BUTTHEREWAS NO 
TURNING BACK NOW, SO I DROPPED MY BIKE AND 
CALLED OUT, "WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?”
DONALD TURNED AROUND AGAIN, AND 
THIS TIME THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE WAS 
WARMER.
I REPEATED, "WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?"
HE GAVE ME A QUESTIONING LOOK AND 
WAITED 'TIL I CAUGHT UP TO HIM.
HE SAID, “HOW CAN YOU SIT THERE AND 
ASK ME WHAT'S MY PROBLEM WHEN YOU GO 
AROUND THE SCHOOL TELLING EVERYONE THAT 
I'M TOO YOUNG AND JUVENILE FOR YOU?"
I WAS CONFUSED. I HAD NEVER SAID 
ANYTHING TO ANYONE ABOUT HIM. I WAS TOO 
SCARED TO. MY FRIENDS THOUGHT HE HAD TOO 
MUCH MONEY AND HE WAS TOO POPULAR, THAT 
HE WAS A WOMANIZER.
I THEN ANSWERED HIM TRUTHFULLY, 
"DONALD, I LIKE YOU, AND I NEVER SAID ANYTHING 
TO ANYONE ABOUT US." I SAID US HOPING HE 
WOULD FIND IT A ROMANTIC GESTURE
HE SAID, “THEN WHY WHEN I ASKED FIONA 
IF YOU WANTED TO GO OUT, SHE SAID YOU SAID 
'NEVER WOULD I LOWER MYSELF TO GO OUT WITH 
A JERK LIKE THAT.'"
I WAS AGHAST. I NEVER SAID ANYTHING 
LIKE THAT NOR DID FIONA EVER TALK TO ME 
ABOUT DONALD. 1 TOLD HIM. HE THEN ASKED 
WHY SHE WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 'TIL 
THIS DAY, I'LL NEVER FIGURE OUT WHY SHE DID IT. 
ME AND DONALD THEN WALKED OVER TO A 
PARK.HE NEVER DID GETTO SURF.
WHEN DARKNESS BEGIN TO FALL, WE 
DECIDED TO PART. HE WALKED ME HOME WHICH 
WAS VERY NICE CONSIDERING IT WAS WAY OUT OF 
HIS WAY. I TOLD HIM HOW MAD I WAS AT FIONA 
AND HOW I WOULD GET HER BACK. HE TOLD ME IT 
DIDNT MATTER, WE WERE TOGETHER NOW. WHAT 
HE SAID ELATED ME! THIS MEANT WE WERE 
GOING OUT! BUT I CONTINUED, "WHO CARES 
WHAT HAPPENED? IF WE DIDNT SEE EACH OTHER

Ail’S
FAIR
ES
LOVE
BECKY FITZGERALD
PETE—PETER WATERS—THAT'S ALL YOU 
HAVE TO SAY TO ME, AND MY HEART GOES WILD! 
PETE IS PROBABLY THE MOST AWESOME GUY 
AROUND! I BET YOU'RE THINKING TO YOURSELF, 
WHY ISN'T THIS GUY TAKEN? WELL. HE IS, BY THAT 
BITCH, LAUREN CYPHER. I HATE HER. SHE HAS 
THE MAN OF MY DREAMS. I ALWAYS SEE THE TWO 
OF THEM TOGETHER. I HATE IT, ESPECIALLY WHEN 
I'M THE ONE WHO LIKES HIM MORE! BUT WHO 
REALLY CARES ABOUT QUEER OLD LAUREN 
ANYWAY? WHAT I DO CARE ABOUT IS PETE. EVEN 
THOUGH EVERYTHING I HEAR ABOUT HIM IS 
NEGATIVE . WELL, NOT NEGATIVE ABOUT HIM PER­
SONALLY, BUT NEGATIVE ABOUT HIS DAD. I GUESS 
HIS DAD IS IN THE MAFIA. AND WHAT CAN I SAY 
BUT, AWESOME! HOPEFULLY, ONE DAY WE'LL GET 
MARRIED, AND HE WILL INHERIT HIS FATHER'S 
FORTUNE!! BUT ALL I HAVE ARE DREAMS ABOUT 
PETE. NOT THE REAL EXPERIENCES LIKE I HAD 
WITH DONALD.
I GUESS I CAN SAY NOW THAT MY "RELA­
TIONSHIP" WITH DONALD IS OVER. I CAN SEE ALL 
THE BAD POINTS THAT HE HAD, BUT HE WILL 
ALWAYS BE MY FIRST LOVE. I KNOW NOW HE WAS 
A MISTAKE, BUT WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES. I JUST 
WISH THAT I COULD GET PETE TO LOOK AT ME. A 
LOT OF GUYS LOOKED AT ME WHEN I WAS IN 
AUSTRALIA, AND A LOT OF GUYS FROM SCHOOL 
ASKED ME OUT. NOW THAT I'M BACK HERE IN 
GOOD OL' FRANKLIN HIGH, NO GUY WILL GIVE ME 
THE TIME OF DAY. IT'S NOT JUST THAT. I MISS 
DONALD, TOO.
DONALD—DONALD O'CONNEL—WHEN I WAS 
IN AUSTRALIA, HE WAS THE BEST GUY I EVER 
DATED (THE FIRST GUY). WELL ANYWAY. WHEN I 
MET DONALD, IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST 
EXCITING DAY IN MY LIFE. I REMEMBER ANDREW 
ASKING ME IF I KNEW DONALD AND ME SAYING 
THE GOOD OLD SAFE LINE, "I DONT KNOW HIM.
BUT I KNOW OF HIM.”
HOW BORING! ANYWAY, THAT DAY IN GYM, I 
WAS WITH MY "GOOD “ FRIEND BEN. BEN STARTED 
ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT DONALD. I STAYED 
ALOOF. NOT GIVING AWAY THE FACT THAT I HAD A 
CRUSH ON THE KID SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF 
SCHOOL.
I CAN GIVE ONE THING TO DONALD, THAT 
HE WAS AWESOME. BUT NOT PETE AWESOME. 
PETE'S AWESOME BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE HIM. I 
HAD DONALD. THAT'S AT LEAST WHAT I THINK.
BACK TO GYM. BEN CONNED ME INTO 
MEETING DONALD, WHICH WAS A DISASTER,YET IT 
WAS AWESOME. FIRST OFF, I HAD NO IDEA WHAT 
TO TALK ABOUT, BUT AFTER A WHILE, I FOUND OUT

Wreck of the Pacific PrincessWe, the passengers of the Love Boat, grew mutinous.
We suspected something was awry even before the ship left Orlando.
There was no evacuation drill.
No presentation on sea sickness.
The vessel seemed to be absent of life rafts.
Then, only an hour into our cruise 
The ship's doctor got on the intercom 
and delivered a solemn lecture.
He warned that we would not just be docking in San Juan, Kingston,
Cancún and Panama City
But every port that every one of us had ever visited.
We were still buzzed on complimentary champagne 
and cluttered with confetti.
We did not appreciate his speech, 
nor his ridiculous appearance;
beard and no moustache
like a celibate progressive Protestant of the 19th Century.
The prick even spit out the cigarette we placed between his lips, 
as we prodded him off of the plank,
like lung cancer would kill him before the sharks that circled beneath the bow.
It was not his fault, 
and when we sobered
we realized that the plausibility of this TV show 
had been sabotaged long ago.
the hull of the ship was weak to start with, 
and our parents had dragged newsworthy icebergs 
of divorce and herpes 
down from the north seas.
At the end of the first week,
the engines cracked, and we were adrift.
The head mechanic said that he could not fix the motors 
until Jarvick started making artificial hearts again.
Some of us wanted to blame the captain, 
who was a former real admiral.
Some felt that we were amidst an ugly fad 
of designer disease.
The crew abandoned metaphor
and locked themselves in the largest stateroom
and pumped away in an unfueled orgy.
We placed out champagne glasses against the door
and tried to distinguish their rockings and rumbles and creaks
from the storm which battered the boat.
The Coast Guard boarded the ship in international waters 
and searched for drugs.
They confiscated all television sets
and some stained back issues of Penthouse
found under the mattress in the late doctor's berth.
No one was upset.
The televisions only received signals in dock,
Charlie's Angels dubbed in Spanish.
But alas, we drifted out of our one hour prime-time slot, 
and ran aground on Fantasy Island.
We subsisted on a diet of bananas 
and midget jokes.
Castaway anarchy grew into a makeshift society, 
and we came to worship a golden parachute 
which flapped endlessly 
in the forest 
on the mountain 
in the center

"I make the rules on this mission, mister. I'm the ranking official. Armstrong 
ain't here."
"But if he were, I'm sure he wouldn't be too happy with you."
"I don't give a shit what Armstrong thinks! Neil Armstrong, all-American 
hero! Sometimes I just want to snap his neck in two, and I wouldn't mind the 
dishonorable discharge, either."
"What kind of way is that to talk about the commander of Apollo 11? On a 
purely professional level, you have to give him some respect."
"Respect, my ass! One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. That 
was my line! That bastard stole it! It was all a big joke to him! Do you know 
what he was planning on saying? Where's the baggage claim? Real funny, 
huh?"
Buzz bowed his head and rubbed his eyes.
"Do you have any idea what it's like? To be the second man to walk on the 
moon? Nobody cares about number two. I have to live with that the rest of my 
life. I could've been the first one. I should've been. Every kid in America would 
know my name."
I put my hand on his shoulder.
"1 know your name, Buzz. Millions do. Don't underestimate the public. We 
know it was a team effort. Hell, 1 remember Michael Collins, and he didn't even 
step on the surface. You guys are something special. I'll never get the chance 
you got. The best thing I ever did was hold my breath all the way through the 
Lincoln Tunnel. But you - you're a hero. You dared us to dream."
"You think so?"
"I know so. Hey, why don't you take a walk? Cool off. Here's a couple of 
bucks. Co get yourself some Tang."
Buzz smiled, took my crumpled bills, and patted me on the back. After he left 
the room, I watched him go down the hall, making sure he'd leave the building. 
When he was gone, I yelled, "Everything's okay now, Julie. I got rid of him."
She came back in the room, took off the helmet, and placed it on Jefferson's 
head. "Looks like my evening's shot."
"It doesn't have to be. Would you like to get some dinner?"
"With you? Get serious."
"Oh -1 see...well, take care...see you around...bye."
I was impressed that I could talk, walk backwards, and avoid stepping on 
shards of green glass all at the same time.
When I got back to my room, I found Stan sitting on the couch, flicking lit 
matches across the room into a metal trash can. I didn't care; I lived close to the 
fire station.

---------------------------------------------------

"Hi there, little lady. You must be Julie."
"Yes. And you are - ?"
"Stan. I'm an old friend of Jeb's. He's told me so much about you. You're 
really gonna give up your career for this guy? Hey, that's great."
"I - don't - understand..."
"Jeb tells me you're a real animal. Hey, all I'm saying is, play it safe. Can't be 
too careful these days."
"Listen, Jeb, forget the wine. I've got to go."
I just stood there. Didn't move, didn't breathe. My head was hot. It felt like 
my hair was on fire.
"Wait! Julie! He's just the...It was only a..."
The door slammed, and my body temperature plummeted. The flames in my 
hair turned into icicles. I feared pneumonia. Then the ice around my mouth 
cracked.
"What have you done? Why did you say that? What do you want from me? 
Do you know who that was? The only person in the world who means anything 
to me! And she's gone! Gone!"
"So why don't you take a swing at me?"
The thought had occurred to me. Unfortunately, the power lines in my body 
were down. My fists weren't taking orders from my brain.
"I'll tell you why, Anderson. Because you don't do anything. She doesn't 
care about you. Never will. Nothing I said is gonna change that. The sad thing 
is, you know it's the truth. Why don't you wise up? You should've kicked me 
out of here a long time ago."
"I'll tell you why I don't hit you! I make it a rule never to slug anyone 
carrying a power drill. Look - maybe everything you say is true. Personally, I 
don't buy it for a second, but if it'll make you shut up, I'll play along. Let's see if 
I have the gist of it - I'm a wimp living in a fantasy world. Fine. What gives you 
the right to tell me how to live my life? Are you my therapist? My guardian 
angel? Did I check off the wrong box on the cable order form? Tell me!"
"Hold it, hold it, hold it! I don't see what you're getting all worked up about. 
What do you want? You want me to speak to the girl? I'll speak to the girl."
"No, no, no...no thank you, you've done quite enough already. I'll speak to 
the girl."
"You want me to come with you?"
"I can do this myself, Stan. Just go back to wherever it is you come from."
"Now you're making me feel guilty. Well, I ain't leaving till I see how this 
turns out."
"Fine. Stay right here. Don't touch anything."
I slammed the door behind me and stormed down the hall. When I got to 
Julie's door, I almost rang the bell, but pounded on the door three times instead. 
It sounded more urgent. The next sound I heard was the thud of a dead bolt.
The door opened a little bit. It looked like Julie was wearing a gold necklace.
No, it was just the chain on the door.
"Jeb, I told you I didn't need the wine."
"The name is Jeff - not Jeb - Jeff." I was about to spell it out, but didn't want to 
seem patronizing. "I have to talk to you."
"Look, my boyfriend's here. I don't think this
"Julie, this is very important. It'll just take a second."
Julie unhooked the chain, and I entered her apartment for the first time. Since 
we last met, Julie had slipped into something more comfortable - a kimono and a 
safari helmet. Her decorating style was what they refer to as 'minimalist.' The 
floor covering seemed to be Astroturf. A queen-sized mattress sat on the fifty 
yard line. A Venetian blind hung on a wall without a window. A life size 
pewter statue of Thomas Jefferson stood in the left back corner. In the right 
corner were three wooden crates. On one of the crates squatted a large man who 
looked rather uncomfortable in his blue sportcoat, white shirt, red tie, and grey 
dress pants. He took a long sip from a bottle of Rolling Rock, and wiped his 
mouth with the back of his massive hand. I guessed he was in his late 40's - 
much too old to be sporting that crew cut. He noticed us standing at the open 
doorway.
"Why the hell did you open that hatch?"
Julie leaned towards me and whispered, "He's been drinking. When he gets 
liquored up, he thinks he's Buzz Aldrin."
"The astronaut?"
She nodded. Before she had a chance to tell me something else I didn't want 
to know, Buzz screamed, "Goddamn bitch! This is a pressurized capsule! You 
broke the airlock!"
The beer bottle came sailing across the room, smashing against the wall about 
six inches over Julie's head. Luckily she was wearing protective headgear. Julie 
just looked at Buzz - no emotion whatsoever. Then, she adjusted her kimono, 
and stormed into the kitchen. It seemed like a good time for me to say some­
thing.
"Whoa, hold on, Buzz! You can't
"That7s Colonel to you, maggot!"
Buzz got up and walked over to where I was standing. He was very close and 
very large.
"Sorry, Colonel, but you can't just go around throwing bottles at people."
"Discipline is everything. Disobedience must be punished."
"Okay, maybe I'm not real familiar with NASA regulations, but I'm pretty 
sure that tossing a Rolling Rock is not a sanctioned punishment. A can of Old 
Mil, maybe, but not a bottle, for god's sake."

---------------------------------------------------

I got a papercut from a Band Aid wrapper. It hurt, but it didn't matter; this 
was a good day. The cableman was coming. If the Messiah showed up at my 
doorstep, he'd have to take a number. I had been waiting three weeks to be 
hooked up, and now nothing could stand in my way. I called in sick that 
morning. My management training at Chemical Bank's Penn Station branch 
would have to be put on hold for 24 hours. I would not - could not - wait 
another day. I needed Australian Rules Football, the Donna Reed Show, tractor 
pulls, 24 hour financial news, home shopping clubs, and Fishin' with Orlando 
Wilson.
Cable was the one thing that could make life in this apartment bearable. I had 
been living here for a month. It was close to the train station, and the rent wasn't 
bad. It seemed like the ideal home. Seemed. Living near the fire station 
appeared to be a great advantage. Within a week, I just wished they'd turn off 
their damn sirens. I thought about doing some Public Service Announcements: 
"Hey, kids, don't play with matches. I need some sleep!"
There are also car dealers in the area. This means a lot of folks take test drives 
in my neighborhood. When I'm driving to the 7-11, it's comforting to know that 
the guy behind me has never driven his car before. To help matters more, the 
salesman in the passenger seat is drawing the driver's attention away from the 
road, pointing out the fine leatherette interior and AC/Delco sound system.
Some people have the man in the moon shining through their bedroom 
windows. I had Colonel Sanders watching over me from his giant rotating 
bucket.
I started having these recurring nightmares. A guy test-driving a firetruck 
was going through the drive-thru window at Kentucky Fried Chicken. I wonder 
how Freud would analyze that. He probably wouldn't get past the firehose.
I was sure cable could turn things around. I could pull the shade down over 
the Colonel and immerse myself in everything our wonderful electronic media 
had to offer. It's not that I was a hermit, but cable would help pass the time until 
something better came along. Like a woman. However, chances on that front 
didn't look very good. I just wasn't meeting women I wanted to share my life 
with. I wasn't even meeting any I wanted to share my Life cereal with. There 
was one girl - Julie down the hall. I fell in love with Julie the second time I saw 
her. The first time she was eating baby back ribs. It wasn't a pretty sight. The 
second time, though, something clicked.
Two days later, I was looking for engagement rings. However, there was a 
problem. She wouldn't give me the time of day. Heck, she wouldn't give me the 
common cold.
Then, one day, Julie rang my bell.
"Excuse me - are you Jeff Anderson?"
'That's me."
"UPS left this package with me. You weren't home when the truck came by."
The package turned out to be a glow-in-the-dark frisbee I had saved a lot of 
box tops for. But it could have been a letter bomb for all I cared.
'Thanks. Thanks a lot."
"Oh, it's no problem."
"Well - thanks. Oh, gee, I don't even know your name."
I did know her name. I knew her license plate number. I knew when she got 
home from work. But Julie didn't have to know that. She might think I was a 
psychopath or something.
"I'm Julie. Julie Garver. I live down the hall."
"Would you like to come in? Something to drink, maybe? I've got Coke, iced 
tea, Yoo-Hoo
"No thanks, I've gotta run. My boyfriend is picking me up. B-bye!"
So I didn't know absolutely everything about her. But I had hope. And I was 
getting cable.
The cableman was scheduled to arrive between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m.. At 6:23, 
there was a knock at the door.
"Come on in, it's open."
There he was, in all his glory. His height was medium; his build, well-done. 
His left hand held a clipboard; his right hand gripped a brand new cable con­
verter. A white patch on his left chest pocket told me his name was Stan.
"You Anderson?"
"Yeah."
"I'm Stan. Storer Cable."
Stan's round head had a Jack Nicholsonesque receding hairline at the top and 
a 6:23 shadow at the bottom. Between his one-size-too-small short sleeve beige 
shirt and his dark brown work pants was a tan utility belt. Some Storer Cable 
demographics survey must have shown that customers are put at ease by earth 
tones. I couldn't wait to receive my first auburn monthly bill.
"You always leave your door unlocked like that?"
"Yeah, pretty much. When I'm home."
"So anyone could just - walk right in."
"I suppose."
"What if I were a homicidal maniac?"
"But you're not."
"How do you know that?"
"You're the cable guy."
"Hey, maniacs have day jobs, you know."
On another day, another time, I might actually have enjoyed a nice discussion 
about occupational trends among social deviants. However...
"Look, install the cable. Then, if you want to kill me, go ahead."

---------------------------------------------------

"Just lookin' out for ya, that's all. You can't be too careful. Listen, I'd love to 
shoot the.breeze with you,.butl'm.already.a little.behind schedule."
I wondered why.
"That doesn't mean I'm gonna do a rush job. You're the last on the list today.
I can take my time. No rush jobs for this guy. Quality, not quantity. That's what 
I always say."
If Stan applied this philosophy to conversation, the job would have been done 
already. But it did appear that he was finally ready to get down to business.
Stan unlatched his utility belt and laid it down on my formica table.
"My waist gets all red and itchy if I leave that thing on too long."
Stan studied the computer printout on his clipboard. He looked at the back of 
the TV. He examined the wall behind the TV, and looked out the window in that 
wall.
"Yeah, this is a cut and dry job. This building's cable line is right outside this 
window. I just have to get that line in here, and we're in business. I'll be out of 
here in no time. I just have to go out to the truck and get the drill."
My eyes lit up. Something about power tools strikes a nerve in men. It's a 
bonding thing. The two people most admired by American men are Black and 
Decker -1 read that in USA Today.
Stan reappeared shortly with a power drill. The drill bit was as long as my 
arm.
"Gee - that's big."
'That's what she said. Heh, heh, heh!"
The bonding was going too far. I feared we would soon be playing touch 
football and pounding some brewskis.
"I've got to watch my mouth. I shouldn't be talking like that when the little 
woman comes home."
"Uh, don't worry. There's no 'little woman.'"
"No? How about a girlfriend?"
"Not at the moment, Stan."
"You've got your eye on somebody, I'm sure."
'There is this girl, Julie, down the hall, but she's sort of 'involved'. Maybe 
I'll...but I shouldn't bother you. You've got a job to do."
Male pride forced me to mention Julie. Besides, if Stan thought I was 'one of 
the guys', maybe he'd let me use the drill.
"Jeff and Julie -1 like it. Give it a shot."
The next sound I heard was a loud roar. Stan had begun to drill a hole in the 
wall, eight inches up from the floor. The grating buzz vibrated parts of my 
anatomy that hadn't moved since my last prom night.
"Hoo-wee. Looks like ya got two feet of brick out there. This could take a 
while."
I had mixed emotions about Stan's warning. On the one hand, there was 
permanent hearing loss to worry about. On the other hand, every minute the 
drill was on was one minute I didn't have to listen to Stan.
Suddenly, the electric whir segued into a human scream.
"Owww! Oh, Christ! Oh, shit!"
Stan cradled his left hand in his right as he crouched on the floor. Either there 
was a problem, or he was about to flash the pitcher the knuckleball sign.
"Stan! What's wrong?"
He spat out the words slowly.
"Goddamn drill..."
"Are you hurt? Is it bad?"
"Maybe. Could you get some help?"
I was never very good at emergencies. Crossword puzzles, I could handle. 
Emergencies, no. I scampered to the phone, almost castrating myself on the 
comer of my end table. Perhaps the hospital had group rates. After picking up 
the receiver, I realized I had no idea who I was calling. My mom always had an 
orange fluorescent sticker on the phone with all the emergency numbers. I 
thought about calling Mom. I reconsidered. By the time the Miami Beach Rescue 
Squad got here, Stan would be installing cable on Cloud Nine. (Would God 
spring for HBO?) And I'd have a lot of explaining to do to the landlord.
"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and dial again. If you require 
assistance, contact the operator."
I hit 'O'. Then I hung up, picked up the receiver, and hit 'O'. Pushing the 
button seemed to reactivate Stan's vocal chords.
"Hoo-hoo! Heh-heh-heh!"
It was an odd sound. I guessed he was coughing blood.
"This is the operator. May I help you?"
"Um, yeah. I need an ambulance. Quick."
Stan's groaning got louder.
"Sir, I need to know what township you're in."
"Uh, operator, could you hold on for a second?"
If I wasn't in the middle of a medical trauma, I would have been fairly 
amused that I put an operator on hold. I cupped my hand over the mouthpiece.
"Stan, what's going on? You okay, pal?"
Stan jumped to his feet.
"Man, I really had you going! You looked like you were gonna wet your 
pants! I can't believe you fell for that, Anderson."
I put the phone back on the hook. If pushing 'O' started Stan talking, perhaps 
hanging up woukL.but no such luck.
"I'm sorry about that, buddy. But if you'd seen the look on your face - man, 
oh, man!"

---------------------------------------------------

"Stan, I'm happy that you had a good laugh. Ha-ha. Hilarious. Now, if 
you'd kindly get back to work, we can both carry on with our lives."
"Touchy, touchy. Just havin' a little fun. I won't bother you again. Fair 
enough?"
"Fair enough."
I didn't want to be around Stan just then, but this one-room hellhole offered 
no escape. My other option was leaving Stan alone with my belongings, but a 
quick mental picture of Stan trying on my boxer shorts made it clear I should 
stick around. I pretended to read yesterday's newspaper. I balanced, unbal­
anced, and re-balanced my checkbook. I looked out the window. A cloud hung 
in the sky like a cloud.
As the metallic crunch of drill vs. brick continued, my brain slowly became 
Jell-o pudding. My head throbbed. It felt like Ringo Starr was playing my 
eardrums.
The drill occasionally shut off long enough for Stan to say, "Man, this thing 
sure gets hot. Here - feel it."
I would politely refuse, and the drill roared once again. During one of the 
moments of silence, I realized that some of the pounding in my head was 
actually pounding on my door.
"Come in."
The door slowly opened to reveal a short man in his mid 60's. His heavy blue 
sweater was missing two buttons. His tan Sansabelt slacks were pulled up over 
half his belly. He wore black socks and slippers, which I knew without even 
looking.
"You always leave the door unlocked?"
"Uh - yeah."
"It's your America. Anyway, hello. I'm Herb Finkelman, second floor."
"I'm Jeff. Jeff Anderson."
"Pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Anderson. Anyway, a few of us in 
the building were wondering where the awful racket was coming from. We have 
narrowed it down to this room. You are having work done?"
"Yes, I'm having cable installed. He's just doing a little drilling."
"I see. Good. Fine. And how long can we expect this to continue?"
"It shouldn't be long now, sir."
"Excellent. You see, some of here are elderly. We hear noises, we worry."
"I'm sorry if I bothered anyone. As I said, he should be done real soon."
"Superb. If you'll excuse me, I must tell Mrs. Finkelman that there is no 
earthquake. Good day, young man."
Finkelman was halfway out the door when Stan realized that three minutes 
had passed without him causing trouble. He decided to rectify the situation.
"Did that geezer buy the 'cable installation' story, Jeffy-poo? Good. No need 
to worry the neighbors. Now come back to big daddy!"
Finkelman looked at me, looked at Stan, looked at me, and left.
"Hoo-wee, Jeffy-poo! Wait'll Mrs. Finkelman hears about this."
'That wasn't funny, Stan! Who the hell do you think you are? I have to live 
here, you idiot! Now my neighbors think I'm a weirdo. Thanks. Thanks a lot."
"What do you care what they think? Does it affect you? No! Let 'em think 
what they want."
'That7s not your decision, dammit! I can't believe you! Listen, Stan, I don't 
want to hear another word. Finish the job, and get out."
MATERIAL
THAT GIVES SERVICE
Stan finished drilling, and went back outside to thread the cablewire through 
the hole. As the cable slowly slid through the wall, it coiled on the floor like a 
noose.
Stan came back in without saying anything. He fastened an attachment on the 
end of the cable, hooked it up to the converter, and attached the converter to the 
TV with a short length of black cable. The moment of truth had arrived. Stan 
pressed the power button.
"Remember to phrase your response in the form of a question. Good luck."
Alex Trebek was behind his podium, and all was well in the world. Stan kept 
his finger on the "channel up" button, checking if all the channels were coming 
in. They were. He would be gone soon.
"Another re-attached umbilical cord. Hope you enjoy your video nutrients."
"Yeah, whatever. Is there anything I have to sign?"
"Yeah, right here."
As I pressed down hard with a ballpoint pen on the triplicate form, there was 
another knock at the door. I wasn't used to all these visitors. Perhaps it was 
Halloween.
"Oh, hi, Julie."
"Hi, Jeb. Listen, I hate to bother you, but my boyfriend just came over, and 1 
haven't had time to shop. You wouldn't have a bottle of wine or anything lying 
around, would you?"
"I might. Let me check."
Had she really called me "Jeb"? I could have corrected her, but I didn't want 
to embarrass either of us. I made a mental note: if we ever had a romantic 
relationship, I would have to get my name legally changed.
I had in my possession one bottle of champagne that had been collecting dust 
in the pantry. My parents gave it to me as a housewarming gift. Considering 
that I wasn't going to christen a boat anytime soon, I was more than happy to get 
rid of it.
I found the champagne behind several cans of Franco American spaghetti. I 
began to walk back to the doorway, but Stan had beat me there.
