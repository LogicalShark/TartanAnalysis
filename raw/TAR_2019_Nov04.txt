Waste code update will affect renters  
Peduto talks OnePGH at CMU panel
ADAM TUNNARD
News Editor
This past month, the Pittsburgh 
City Council unanimously passed 
changes to municipal waste code 
619 that will primarily affect rent-
ers and landlords in Pittsburgh. 
The changes will go into effect 
this summer. According to the 
of?ce of Erika Strassburger, who 
spearheaded the changes, the “ul-
timate goal is to make it easier for 
people to recycle and hopefully 
increase the amount of material 
that is recycled.”
Among the changes made, 
new provisions now require 
landlords to “provide both waste 
and recycling storage containers 
for their tenants, these must be 
watertight with close ?tting lids,” 
and to provide Pittsburgh speci?c 
recycling literature “to tenants as 
part of leases,” said Moira Egler, 
Councilperson Strassburger’s 
Chief of Staff, in an interview 
with The Tartan.
In addition to these changes, 
violations of the new waste 
code will now result in notices 
being sent to both the tenant 
and landlord and the mandate to 
recycle will be made more explicit 
in the code itself.
Small recycling changes have 
been clari?ed, as stated in the 
Pittsburgh Public Works waste 
regulations website.
These include the ability 
to place recycling out in blue 
translucent bags and the 
codi?cation of set out times as 
being “no sooner than 6 p.m. the 
day prior to collection, no later 
than 6 a.m. day of collection,” and 
bin retrieval times as being “by 10 
p.m. the day of collection.”
The legislation was an effort 
made in partnership with the 
City of Pittsburgh Bureau of 
Environmental Services and with 
the of?ce of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill 
Peduto. It passed unanimously in 
the council with few amendments.
The only pushback on the 
legislation came from a collection 
of residents that raised concerns 
about the code’s initial bin retriev-
al time, which was that bins had 
to be removed from side streets 
no later than 7:00 p.m. Some 
residents, like those working 
odd hours or with afternoon and 
night shifts, would be negatively 
affected by this set time.
Addressing these concerns, the 
latest possible retrieval time was 
pushed back to 10:00 p.m. in the 
now-passed legislation. Previous-
ly, the legislation did not enforce 
a speci?ed removal time.
In response to the prospect of 
rent increases due to the mandate 
that landlords provide waste 
bins, Egler stated that the of?ce 
“[hasn’t] heard concerns” about 
such an issue, and that “the con-
tainers are pretty reasonably 
priced.” Egler then noted that the 
mandate is speci?cally for “apart-
ment buildings with ?ve and fewer 
units,” and that these changes are 
“common sense provisions that

“Numbers do not speak for 
themselves,” said Sir David 
Spiegelhalter, a world-renowned 
statistician, to a crowd of near-
ly 100 professors and students 
who had gathered in McConomy 
Auditorium to hear him speak. 
“The stories we tell, the way 
they’re packaged makes all the dif-
ference to their emotional impact.”
We are living in the age of 
data. Technology plays a bigger 
role in people’s daily lives than 
ever before, and many of society’s 
core issues can be reframed as 
statistical problems. Yet it is also 
the age of misinformation, and 
the ?eld of statistics is facing more 
challenges than ever before.
Sir David Spiegelhalter’s lec-
ture on Monday, April 22, was 
the second installment of the Ste-
phen and Joyce Fienberg memo-
rial lecture series. Stephen Fien-
berg, who died of cancer in 2016, 
was the head of the Carnegie 
Mellon statistics department. 
He was highly respected and 
in?uential in the ?eld of statistics 
for his dedication to applying 
statistics for societal good. Joyce 
Fienberg, Stephen Fienbergs’s 
wife who perished in the Tree 
of Life synagogue shooting last 
Oct., worked as a researcher 
at the Learning Research and 
Development Center at the 
University of Pittsburgh and was a 
great supporter and friend of the 
statistics department at Carnegie 
Mellon.
“Steve sets a high bar for how 
statistic are communicated,” 
said Sir David Spiegelhalter. In 
his lecture, he focused on how 
statistics are manipulated for 
sensational and persuasive means. 
Spiegelhalter serves as a chair 
at the Winton Centre for Risk 
and Evidence Communication, 
which is part of the University 
of Cambridge’s department of 
mathematics. In his career, he 
has published over 200 papers 
and written several books. He has 
spent the last decade focusing 
on the application of statistics 
to everyday life, appearing in 
numerous T.V. specials on BBC 
and CNN to discuss issues re-
lated to probability and climate 
change. In 2014, he was knighted 
for his service to medical statistics, 
but he jokes that his greatest 
achievement is an appearance on 
the game show Winter Wipeout.
Spiegelhalter explained the 
pipeline of statistical evidence. 
Initially, data is collected by 
researchers and statisticians. 
Their research is then passed on 
to journals and the commissioners 
of the research, all of whom may 
have “selection biases.” Then the 
research is turned over to the

On Saturday, a gunman 
entered a synagogue in Califor-
nia shouting anti-Semitic slurs, 
and opened ?re with an AR-15 
style gun, as reported by The New 
York Times.
The shooting left a 60 year old 
woman dead, a rabbi wounded in 
his hand, and two others injured 
by shrapnel wounds.
It occurred on the Sabbath, 
and the last day of Passover, 
a week-long holiday that 
celebrates Jewish liberation 
from slavery.
The shooting took place at 
the Chabad of Poway. Poway is 
a suburban town about 25 miles 
north of San Diego.
The shooting occurred exactly 
six months after the Tree of Life 
synagogue shooting that jarred 
Pittsburgh and the Jewish com-
munity at large on Oct. 27, 2018. 
It is the most recent in a series of 
deadly attacks in houses of wor-
ship, including the mass shoot-
ing in mosques in New Zealand 
last month and the church bomb-
ings in Sri Lanka last week.
The gunman has been 
identi?ed as John Earnest, a 
19 year old from San Diego. He 
?ed the synagogue after the 
shooting, but soon after called 
the California Highway Patrol 
to report his location and was 
apprehended.
Police are reportedly 
investigating a manifesto that 
was posted on 8chan before 
the shooting, which is ?lled 
with white nationalist conspir-
acy theories and racist slurs, as 
reported by The New York Times.
Last year, a study released 
by the Anti-Defamation League 
found a 57 percent increase in 
anti-Semitic incidents.
Jonathan Greenblatt, the 
chief executive and national 
director of the Anti-Defamation 
League, told The New York Times 
that “This was a pointed attack 
on Chabad, on the visible Jewish 
community here, and this is a 
collective attack on all Jewish 
communities — this is anti-Sem-
itism unleashed.”

Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto 
is continuing his effort to get 
his stalled fund for social and 
sustainable action in Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, off the ground.
A panel this past Thursday 
titled “The City of Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, and Alignment with the 
Sustainable Development Goals” 
brought this discussion to Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus. Speaking 
alongside Peduto was the head 
of Heinz College in Washington, 
D.C., Amb. Sarah Mendelson, 
serving as the panel moderator, 
and panelists Leah Lizarondo, 
Heinz alum and CEO of 412Food 
Rescue, Jerry MacCleary, CEO of 
materials company Covestro, and 
Anthony Pipa, Senior Fellow at the 
Brookings Institution.
The talk was framed around 
Pittsburgh’s interpretation of the 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs): 17 markers developed 
by the U.N. as a guide for global 
growth. These goals, Peduto 
claims, align with the 10 areas 
developed by the Rockefeller 
Foundation and the City of 
Pittsburgh for the city’s 12-year 
resiliency plan. These, in turn, be-
came Peduto’s proposed OnePGH 
fund, which would funnel money 
from the city, local nonpro?ts, 
and corporations to organizations 
working toward 47 planned proj-
ects.
Peduto emphasized the 
importance of action on the 
city level, citing a “vacuum of 
leadership in Washington.” 
However, according to Peduto, 
OnePGH is neccesary because the 
City of Pittsburgh does not have 
the leverage to act on its own. 
“[The projects] can’t happen un-
der old models. Old models are 
city government,” said Peduto.
“We don’t have the capacity 
to address hunger and poverty,” 
said Peduto, “but if we create a 
separate organization that then 
helps those that are on the ground 
addressing hunger and homeless-
ness, and being able to use that 
organization to prop up the non-
pro?ts throughout the city and 
this region, then we can get to our 
goals together.”

Pittsburgh sits on the Marcellus 
Shale, one of the largest deposits 
of natural gas in the United 
States. This past Wednesday, 
President Trump delivered the 
keynote address at Shale Insight, 
a conference hosted by the 
Marcellus Shale Coalition, the 
Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and 
the West Virginia Oil and Natural 
Gas Association. 
This marks his second visit to 
the region in the past months, 
after his Aug. rally at the Shell 
cracker plant in Beaver County.
The Shale Insights conference 
was attended largely by those 
working in natural gas. In his 
remarks, Trump emphasized his 
support for the industry, citing 
the rollback of environmental 
regulations and withdrawal from 
the Paris Climate Accords. 
The keynote address was 
open to the public, with a section 
cordoned off to create space for 
a rally in the back, and Trump 
addressed some of the activat-
ing issues for his supporters, 
including re-upping his claim that 
he is working for “Pittsburgh, not 
Paris.”
Indigenous activists and anti-
fracking groups gathered at 
Point State Park and held a water 
ceremony in the Ohio River before 
marching into downtown for a 
second Defend the Water rally 
in protest of the conference. The 
rally was intended to “address 
the destructive impacts of the 
petrochemical industry build-
out in the Ohio River Valley 
and beyond on people and the 
environment,” according to the 
website of Breath Project, one of 
the rally’s co-organizers.
The protests expanded beyond 
an opposition to fracking, many 
focusing on Trump himself. 14 
protesters, holding a sign that 
read “Our solidarity will defeat 
white nationalism,” were arrested 
for blocking a ramp from the Fort 
Pitt Bridge near the convention 
center where the conference was 
being held.

During the ?rst-ever Tartan 
Community Day, students 
attended a presentation on the 
results of a multi-year study on 
personal well-being among the 
Carnegie Mellon student body, 
gathering together and enjoying 
ice cream sandwiches in the 
Rangos Ballroom. The presen-
tation was given by David Cre-
swell, a professor in Dietrich 
College’s psychology department 
and principal investigator for the 
project they call Life@CMU.
“This project is so distinctly 
CMU,” President Jahanian stated, 
describing the project as being 
centered on science and data 
analytics to improve student 
wellbeing. “The Life@CMU 
study illuminates the nuanced 
ecosystem of individuals, 
traditions, culture, that make up 
our community. It has allowed 
us to better understand the CMU 
experience and draw on the data 
that’s collected to in?uence our 
interventions, programs, and 
resources.”
Concluding his introductory 
statement, Jahanian added, “I 
want all of you to know that no 
one is immune to feeling alone 
or vulnerable at times… not even 
your president. But in moments of 
uncertainty we must remember 
that we are a community. There is 
an incredible network of support 
that surrounds us. Use it. Lean 
on one another. This is one of the 
most profound ways in which we 
can act as a community and also 
thrive as individuals.”
Creswell described the 
goals of the project as an at-
tempt to “better understand the 
culture at Carnegie Mellon, the 
stress culture… we wanted to 
understand stress, we wanted 
to understand mental health 
and sleep patterns here in our 
students so we can better help our 
students, with their health and 
academic success.”
Before going into the Carnegie 
Mellon-speci?c results, Creswell 
provided context for the grow-
ing mental health problems 
in our broader society. As an 
example, he pointed to ?ndings 
from a study that tracked mental 
health outcomes of a nationally 
representative sample of people 
in the U.S. that found there was 
a 50 percent increase in ma-
jor depression diagnoses from 
2009 to 2017 among younger 
Americans.
Phase I of the Life@CMU 
project followed a sample of ?rst-
year students over the course of 
the 2017 spring semester. The 
following spring Phase II tracked 
?rst-year and sophomore students 
over the semester as well. They 
were able to track 85 students 
who participated in both phases 
to examine their transition from 
being ?rst-years to sophomores.
They gathered data on factors 
of students’ well-being and

“She was one of those students 
who was smarter than the teacher, 
and the teacher knew it but 
wouldn’t say it out loud,” confessed 
Jim Daniels, English Professor 
at Carnegie Mellon and former 
teacher of author Sarah Valentine. 
Daniels showered Valentine with 
praise before her MLK Jr. Day 
Writing Awards speech on her life 
story and autobiographical book, 
When I Was White: A Memoir.
During her time at Carnegie 
Mellon, Valentine was a part of 
the English Department and the 
Modern Languages department, 
where she studied Russian as an 
undergraduate. She graduated in 
2000.
Valentine’s speech was held last 
Thursday in the Center for Student 
Diversity and Inclusion. Setting 
the stage for Valentine’s speech, 
M. Shernell Smith, Associate 
Director at the Of?ce of the Dean 
of Student Affairs, said, “there are 
times in this room where you really 
don’t know who’s who. It’s good 
because we can create this sense of 
connection.”
“I graduated almost 20 years 
ago, and it’s great to see how much 
the university has grown in terms 
of its engagement with diversity. 
Even then, the English department 
was ahead of the curve. The MLK 
writing awards program started 
when I was a student,” Valentine 
said.
Valentine thanked Daniels for 
his praise. She also thanked him 
for being an important mentor to 
her at Carnegie Mellon. Much of 
her speech and memoirs from her 
book focused on her senior year at 
Carnegie Mellon.
When I Was White and the 
speech she gave at the MLK writing 
awards focused on Valentine’s 
struggles with racial identity 
throughout her life. Raised in an 
Irish-Italian household by her 
biological mother’s family and 
stepdad, Valentine was expected to 
conform to her European identity 
by her mother and was unaware 
that her father was a black man. 
Valentine has had to grapple with 
her African-American identity 
after believing she was white 
growing up.
Recounting a Saint Patrick’s 
day festival from her college years, 
Valentine said she told her friends 
that she was Irish, to which they 
responded, “Yeah, everyone’s Irish 
on Saint Patrick’s day!” Valentine 
told the audience that, though her 
friends saw her as other, she felt 
connected to her Irish identity, 
and she was terri?ed to confront 
this difference she had with her 
friends.
Valentine also told the 
audience about how she stole an 
Irish heritage ring from a vendor 
at the festival, later tossing it 
on the ground out of guilt and 
abandoning it. A guard searched 
her to no avail when she was re-
ported for it, and Valentine told the 
crowd that her friends thought she 
was being racially pro?led.
Valentine wanted to confess 
about the ring badly, and she 
?nally got her chance in Daniels’ 
poetry class where she got to write 
about the incident. She joyfully 
recalled her time as a student with 
Daniels.
“Jim showed me what it was 
like to be a poet in real life. He was 
such a regular guy,” Valentine said, 
laughing. “That’s a good thing. He 
was a family man, no one crazy, 
who was able to show me he could 
be a good writer. It let me know 
I could be myself and be a good 
writer.”
Valentine also told the 
audience a few heart-wrenching 
anecdotes from her childhood. 
She commented on how she 
was expected to look and act 
white, and one aspect of this was 
straightening her hair. Once her 
mother ironed her hair, painfully 
burning her scalp.
“I ended up admiring the white 
girls at my school for their hair. 
I fell into the role of the well-
behaved, well-groomed daughter 
to satisfy my parents and other 
adults. I felt like I was in a struggle 
to please people as a little girl and 
be myself at the same time.”
“White people had been asking 
me questions about my identity 
my whole life and accepted 
whatever answer I gave them. I was 
constantly questioned about my 
hair, family, and ethnicity. I had few 
black people in her life, and I felt as 
though I’d been hiding behind my 
whiteness,” said Valentine.
During the Q&A session, 
Valentine revealed to the audience 
that she has yet to ?gure out who 
her biological father is. “I had 
searched before but decided to 
suspend the search because of 
how much energy it took. I came to 
accept that I didn’t need someone 
else to validate who I was. I’m still 
interested, but it’s not something I 
need to know to move on with my 
life.”
Many of Valentine’s friends 
and family were in the audience, 
and they mentioned that talk-
ing about Valentine’s dad during 
her childhood was very much off 
limits. Valentine described her 
current relationship with her mom 
as being a “truce,” and she says she 
has forgiven her parents, who now 
recognize her African-American 
identity.
After Valentine’s speech, 
Daniels talked with The Tartan 
about his time as Valentine’s 
teacher. From 1998 to 2000, 
Valentine was in every one of 
Daniels’ poetry workshops. She 
also participated in a mentoring 
program Daniels did with high 
school students at the Pittsburgh 
High School for the Creative and 
Performing Arts.
“In class, she wasn’t the stu-
dent who spoke the most, but 
when she spoke, she was able to 
read the subtleties and nuances 
of poems with amazing depth and 
insight. She had a warmth and 
generosity of spirit that set the 
tone for the class and allowed the 
other students to be both frank 
and empathetic with each other,” 
Daniels said.
“When I ?rst read When I Was 
White, I found myself underlining 
and starring passages just like I 
did when she was my student. On 
a sentence-by-sentence level, her 
writing really sings. It’s not just 
the unusual, provocative story she 
has to tell, but the skillful way that 
she tells it that makes the book so 
special.”
Sarah Valentine, author and Carnegie Mellon alumna from the class of 2000, reads from her new memoir in the Cohon Center.

Waste code update will affect renters  
Peduto talks OnePGH at CMU panel
ADAM TUNNARD
News Editor
This past month, the Pittsburgh 
City Council unanimously passed 
changes to municipal waste code 
619 that will primarily affect rent-
ers and landlords in Pittsburgh. 
The changes will go into effect 
this summer. According to the 
of?ce of Erika Strassburger, who 
spearheaded the changes, the “ul-
timate goal is to make it easier for 
people to recycle and hopefully 
increase the amount of material 
that is recycled.”
Among the changes made, 
new provisions now require 
landlords to “provide both waste 
and recycling storage containers 
for their tenants, these must be 
watertight with close ?tting lids,” 
and to provide Pittsburgh speci?c 
recycling literature “to tenants as 
part of leases,” said Moira Egler, 
Councilperson Strassburger’s 
Chief of Staff, in an interview 
with The Tartan.
In addition to these changes, 
violations of the new waste 
code will now result in notices 
being sent to both the tenant 
and landlord and the mandate to 
recycle will be made more explicit 
in the code itself.
Small recycling changes have 
been clari?ed, as stated in the 
Pittsburgh Public Works waste 
regulations website.
These include the ability 
to place recycling out in blue 
translucent bags and the 
codi?cation of set out times as 
being “no sooner than 6 p.m. the 
day prior to collection, no later 
than 6 a.m. day of collection,” and 
bin retrieval times as being “by 10 
p.m. the day of collection.”
The legislation was an effort 
made in partnership with the 
City of Pittsburgh Bureau of 
Environmental Services and with 
the of?ce of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill 
Peduto. It passed unanimously in 
the council with few amendments.
The only pushback on the 
legislation came from a collection 
of residents that raised concerns 
about the code’s initial bin retriev-
al time, which was that bins had 
to be removed from side streets 
no later than 7:00 p.m. Some 
residents, like those working 
odd hours or with afternoon and 
night shifts, would be negatively 
affected by this set time.
Addressing these concerns, the 
latest possible retrieval time was 
pushed back to 10:00 p.m. in the 
now-passed legislation. Previous-
ly, the legislation did not enforce 
a speci?ed removal time.
In response to the prospect of 
rent increases due to the mandate 
that landlords provide waste 
bins, Egler stated that the of?ce 
“[hasn’t] heard concerns” about 
such an issue, and that “the con-
tainers are pretty reasonably 
priced.” Egler then noted that the 
mandate is speci?cally for “apart-
ment buildings with ?ve and fewer 
units,” and that these changes are 
“common sense provisions that

“Numbers do not speak for 
themselves,” said Sir David 
Spiegelhalter, a world-renowned 
statistician, to a crowd of near-
ly 100 professors and students 
who had gathered in McConomy 
Auditorium to hear him speak. 
“The stories we tell, the way 
they’re packaged makes all the dif-
ference to their emotional impact.”
We are living in the age of 
data. Technology plays a bigger 
role in people’s daily lives than 
ever before, and many of society’s 
core issues can be reframed as 
statistical problems. Yet it is also 
the age of misinformation, and 
the ?eld of statistics is facing more 
challenges than ever before.
Sir David Spiegelhalter’s lec-
ture on Monday, April 22, was 
the second installment of the Ste-
phen and Joyce Fienberg memo-
rial lecture series. Stephen Fien-
berg, who died of cancer in 2016, 
was the head of the Carnegie 
Mellon statistics department. 
He was highly respected and 
in?uential in the ?eld of statistics 
for his dedication to applying 
statistics for societal good. Joyce 
Fienberg, Stephen Fienbergs’s 
wife who perished in the Tree 
of Life synagogue shooting last 
Oct., worked as a researcher 
at the Learning Research and 
Development Center at the 
University of Pittsburgh and was a 
great supporter and friend of the 
statistics department at Carnegie 
Mellon.
“Steve sets a high bar for how 
statistic are communicated,” 
said Sir David Spiegelhalter. In 
his lecture, he focused on how 
statistics are manipulated for 
sensational and persuasive means. 
Spiegelhalter serves as a chair 
at the Winton Centre for Risk 
and Evidence Communication, 
which is part of the University 
of Cambridge’s department of 
mathematics. In his career, he 
has published over 200 papers 
and written several books. He has 
spent the last decade focusing 
on the application of statistics 
to everyday life, appearing in 
numerous T.V. specials on BBC 
and CNN to discuss issues re-
lated to probability and climate 
change. In 2014, he was knighted 
for his service to medical statistics, 
but he jokes that his greatest 
achievement is an appearance on 
the game show Winter Wipeout.
Spiegelhalter explained the 
pipeline of statistical evidence. 
Initially, data is collected by 
researchers and statisticians. 
Their research is then passed on 
to journals and the commissioners 
of the research, all of whom may 
have “selection biases.” Then the 
research is turned over to the

On Saturday, a gunman 
entered a synagogue in Califor-
nia shouting anti-Semitic slurs, 
and opened ?re with an AR-15 
style gun, as reported by The New 
York Times.
The shooting left a 60 year old 
woman dead, a rabbi wounded in 
his hand, and two others injured 
by shrapnel wounds.
It occurred on the Sabbath, 
and the last day of Passover, 
a week-long holiday that 
celebrates Jewish liberation 
from slavery.
The shooting took place at 
the Chabad of Poway. Poway is 
a suburban town about 25 miles 
north of San Diego.
The shooting occurred exactly 
six months after the Tree of Life 
synagogue shooting that jarred 
Pittsburgh and the Jewish com-
munity at large on Oct. 27, 2018. 
It is the most recent in a series of 
deadly attacks in houses of wor-
ship, including the mass shoot-
ing in mosques in New Zealand 
last month and the church bomb-
ings in Sri Lanka last week.
The gunman has been 
identi?ed as John Earnest, a 
19 year old from San Diego. He 
?ed the synagogue after the 
shooting, but soon after called 
the California Highway Patrol 
to report his location and was 
apprehended.
Police are reportedly 
investigating a manifesto that 
was posted on 8chan before 
the shooting, which is ?lled 
with white nationalist conspir-
acy theories and racist slurs, as 
reported by The New York Times.
Last year, a study released 
by the Anti-Defamation League 
found a 57 percent increase in 
anti-Semitic incidents.
Jonathan Greenblatt, the 
chief executive and national 
director of the Anti-Defamation 
League, told The New York Times 
that “This was a pointed attack 
on Chabad, on the visible Jewish 
community here, and this is a 
collective attack on all Jewish 
communities — this is anti-Sem-
itism unleashed.”

Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto 
is continuing his effort to get 
his stalled fund for social and 
sustainable action in Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, off the ground.
A panel this past Thursday 
titled “The City of Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, and Alignment with the 
Sustainable Development Goals” 
brought this discussion to Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus. Speaking 
alongside Peduto was the head 
of Heinz College in Washington, 
D.C., Amb. Sarah Mendelson, 
serving as the panel moderator, 
and panelists Leah Lizarondo, 
Heinz alum and CEO of 412Food 
Rescue, Jerry MacCleary, CEO of 
materials company Covestro, and 
Anthony Pipa, Senior Fellow at the 
Brookings Institution.
The talk was framed around 
Pittsburgh’s interpretation of the 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs): 17 markers developed 
by the U.N. as a guide for global 
growth. These goals, Peduto 
claims, align with the 10 areas 
developed by the Rockefeller 
Foundation and the City of 
Pittsburgh for the city’s 12-year 
resiliency plan. These, in turn, be-
came Peduto’s proposed OnePGH 
fund, which would funnel money 
from the city, local nonpro?ts, 
and corporations to organizations 
working toward 47 planned proj-
ects.
Peduto emphasized the 
importance of action on the 
city level, citing a “vacuum of 
leadership in Washington.” 
However, according to Peduto, 
OnePGH is neccesary because the 
City of Pittsburgh does not have 
the leverage to act on its own. 
“[The projects] can’t happen un-
der old models. Old models are 
city government,” said Peduto.
“We don’t have the capacity 
to address hunger and poverty,” 
said Peduto, “but if we create a 
separate organization that then 
helps those that are on the ground 
addressing hunger and homeless-
ness, and being able to use that 
organization to prop up the non-
pro?ts throughout the city and 
this region, then we can get to our 
goals together.”

Pittsburgh sits on the Marcellus 
Shale, one of the largest deposits 
of natural gas in the United 
States. This past Wednesday, 
President Trump delivered the 
keynote address at Shale Insight, 
a conference hosted by the 
Marcellus Shale Coalition, the 
Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and 
the West Virginia Oil and Natural 
Gas Association. 
This marks his second visit to 
the region in the past months, 
after his Aug. rally at the Shell 
cracker plant in Beaver County.
The Shale Insights conference 
was attended largely by those 
working in natural gas. In his 
remarks, Trump emphasized his 
support for the industry, citing 
the rollback of environmental 
regulations and withdrawal from 
the Paris Climate Accords. 
The keynote address was 
open to the public, with a section 
cordoned off to create space for 
a rally in the back, and Trump 
addressed some of the activat-
ing issues for his supporters, 
including re-upping his claim that 
he is working for “Pittsburgh, not 
Paris.”
Indigenous activists and anti-
fracking groups gathered at 
Point State Park and held a water 
ceremony in the Ohio River before 
marching into downtown for a 
second Defend the Water rally 
in protest of the conference. The 
rally was intended to “address 
the destructive impacts of the 
petrochemical industry build-
out in the Ohio River Valley 
and beyond on people and the 
environment,” according to the 
website of Breath Project, one of 
the rally’s co-organizers.
The protests expanded beyond 
an opposition to fracking, many 
focusing on Trump himself. 14 
protesters, holding a sign that 
read “Our solidarity will defeat 
white nationalism,” were arrested 
for blocking a ramp from the Fort 
Pitt Bridge near the convention 
center where the conference was 
being held.

During the ?rst-ever Tartan 
Community Day, students 
attended a presentation on the 
results of a multi-year study on 
personal well-being among the 
Carnegie Mellon student body, 
gathering together and enjoying 
ice cream sandwiches in the 
Rangos Ballroom. The presen-
tation was given by David Cre-
swell, a professor in Dietrich 
College’s psychology department 
and principal investigator for the 
project they call Life@CMU.
“This project is so distinctly 
CMU,” President Jahanian stated, 
describing the project as being 
centered on science and data 
analytics to improve student 
wellbeing. “The Life@CMU 
study illuminates the nuanced 
ecosystem of individuals, 
traditions, culture, that make up 
our community. It has allowed 
us to better understand the CMU 
experience and draw on the data 
that’s collected to in?uence our 
interventions, programs, and 
resources.”
Concluding his introductory 
statement, Jahanian added, “I 
want all of you to know that no 
one is immune to feeling alone 
or vulnerable at times… not even 
your president. But in moments of 
uncertainty we must remember 
that we are a community. There is 
an incredible network of support 
that surrounds us. Use it. Lean 
on one another. This is one of the 
most profound ways in which we 
can act as a community and also 
thrive as individuals.”
Creswell described the 
goals of the project as an at-

“She was one of those students 
who was smarter than the teacher, 
and the teacher knew it but 
wouldn’t say it out loud,” confessed 
Jim Daniels, English Professor 
at Carnegie Mellon and former 
teacher of author Sarah Valentine. 
Daniels showered Valentine with 
praise before her MLK Jr. Day 
Writing Awards speech on her life 
story and autobiographical book, 
When I Was White: A Memoir.
During her time at Carnegie 
Mellon, Valentine was a part of 
the English Department and the 
Modern Languages department, 
where she studied Russian as an 
undergraduate. She graduated in 
2000.
Valentine’s speech was held last 
Thursday in the Center for Student 
Diversity and Inclusion. Setting 
the stage for Valentine’s speech, 
M. Shernell Smith, Associate 
Director at the Of?ce of the Dean 
of Student Affairs, said, “there are 
times in this room where you really 
don’t know who’s who. It’s good 
because we can create this sense of 
connection.”
“I graduated almost 20 years 
ago, and it’s great to see how much 
the university has grown in terms 
of its engagement with diversity. 
Even then, the English department 
was ahead of the curve. The MLK 
writing awards program started 
when I was a student,” Valentine 
said.
Valentine thanked Daniels for 
his praise. She also thanked him 
for being an important mentor to 
her at Carnegie Mellon. Much of 
her speech and memoirs from her 
book focused on her senior year at 
Carnegie Mellon.
When I Was White and the 
speech she gave at the MLK writing 
awards focused on Valentine’s 
struggles with racial identity 
throughout her life. Raised in an 
Irish-Italian household by her 
biological mother’s family and 
stepdad, Valentine was expected to 
conform to her European identity 
by her mother and was unaware 
that her father was a black man. 
Valentine has had to grapple with 
her African-American identity 
after believing she was white 
growing up.
Recounting a Saint Patrick’s 
day festival from her college years, 
Valentine said she told her friends 
that she was Irish, to which they 
responded, “Yeah, everyone’s Irish 
on Saint Patrick’s day!” Valentine 
told the audience that, though her 
friends saw her as other, she felt 
connected to her Irish identity, 
and she was terri?ed to confront 
this difference she had with her 
friends.
Valentine also told the 
audience about how she stole an 
Irish heritage ring from a vendor 
at the festival, later tossing it 
on the ground out of guilt and 
abandoning it. A guard searched 
her to no avail when she was re-
ported for it, and Valentine told the 
crowd that her friends thought she 
was being racially pro?led.
Valentine wanted to confess 
about the ring badly, and she 
?nally got her chance in Daniels’ 
poetry class where she got to write 
about the incident. She joyfully 
recalled her time as a student with 
Daniels.
“Jim showed me what it was 
like to be a poet in real life. He was 
such a regular guy,” Valentine said, 
laughing. “That’s a good thing. He 
was a family man, no one crazy, 
who was able to show me he could 
be a good writer. It let me know 
I could be myself and be a good 
writer.”
Valentine also told the 
audience a few heart-wrenching 
anecdotes from her childhood. 
She commented on how she 
was expected to look and act 
white, and one aspect of this was 
straightening her hair. Once her 
mother ironed her hair, painfully 
burning her scalp.
“I ended up admiring the white 
girls at my school for their hair. 
I fell into the role of the well-
behaved, well-groomed daughter 
to satisfy my parents and other 
adults. I felt like I was in a struggle 
to please people as a little girl and 
be myself at the same time.”
“White people had been asking 
me questions about my identity 
my whole life and accepted 
whatever answer I gave them. I was 
constantly questioned about my 
hair, family, and ethnicity. I had few 
black people in her life, and I felt as 
though I’d been hiding behind my 
whiteness,” said Valentine.
During the Q&A session, 
Valentine revealed to the audience 
that she has yet to ?gure out who 
her biological father is. “I had 
searched before but decided to 
suspend the search because of 
how much energy it took. I came to 
accept that I didn’t need someone 
else to validate who I was. I’m still 
interested, but it’s not something I 
need to know to move on with my 
life.”
Many of Valentine’s friends 
and family were in the audience, 
and they mentioned that talk-
ing about Valentine’s dad during 
her childhood was very much off 
limits. Valentine described her 
current relationship with her mom 
as being a “truce,” and she says she 
has forgiven her parents, who now 
recognize her African-American 
identity.
After Valentine’s speech, 
Daniels talked with The Tartan 
about his time as Valentine’s 
teacher. From 1998 to 2000, 
Valentine was in every one of 
Daniels’ poetry workshops. She 
also participated in a mentoring 
program Daniels did with high 
school students at the Pittsburgh 
High School for the Creative and 
Performing Arts.
“In class, she wasn’t the stu-
dent who spoke the most, but 
when she spoke, she was able to 
read the subtleties and nuances 
of poems with amazing depth and 
insight. She had a warmth and 
generosity of spirit that set the 
tone for the class and allowed the 
other students to be both frank 
and empathetic with each other,” 
Daniels said.
“When I ?rst read When I Was 
White, I found myself underlining 
and starring passages just like I 
did when she was my student. On 
a sentence-by-sentence level, her 
writing really sings. It’s not just 
the unusual, provocative story she 
has to tell, but the skillful way that 
she tells it that makes the book so 
special.”
Sarah Valentine, author and Carnegie Mellon alumna from the class of 2000, reads from her new memoir in the Cohon Center.

Car ?re under CIC prompts evacuationForum on hate crime hosted on campus
CHINASA MBANUGO
Assistant News Editor
The Center for Diversity and 
Inclusion hosted the “Forum on 
Hate Crimes” this past Wednesday, 
Oct. 30. Events were held from 
8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., including 
presentations from Judy Shepard, 
the mother of Matthew Shepard, 
Cynthia Deitle, a former FBI agent 
and director of the Matthew 
Shepard Foundation. A panel 
titled ‘Preventing Hate Crimes 
and Law Enforcement’ featured 
Dr. RaShall Brackney, chief of 
police for Charlottesville. 
Brackney spent 30 years in 
the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police 
and is a Carnegie Mellon alumna, 
earning her B.S. in 2009 and her 
master’s degree in 2011 from 
Carnegie Mellon.
Brackney’s last speaking 
engagement came near the end 
of the activity-packed day. She 
led a discussion, which mainly 
consisted of a Q&A, in the main 
seating area of the Center of 
Diversity and Inclusion with 
students and faculty.
Attendees listened intently to 
her descriptions of her experience 
in Pittsburgh. Brackney began by 
speaking about her life at Carnegie 
Mellon, “When I arrived here I 
didn’t feel like I belonged… there 
was only one black professor, 
so it was an extremely isolating 
experience,” she said.
During her discussion, 
Brackney explained how she 
exists as both a black person and 
a police of?cer. In her career she 
has worked in “every division” to 
continue her work in deciphering 
the ways that the system was built 
to harm black people, she says.
She highlighted her own 
activism within her job: “I have 
protested against other cops 
because of their violence against 
black men.” Notably, she said she 
was disgusted by the way that 
three Pittsburgh police of?cers 
used excessive force on Jordan 
Miles, a black student who was 
brutally beaten and left with 
bruises and broken bones.
One student asked Brackney, 
“how do you mitigate the fact that 
many policies that are enforced by 
police of?cers are meant to set up 
black people to fail?”
Brackney responded that she 
tries to look at policies through 
an “equitable lens” and that 
she has agreements with the 
Commonwealth Attorney about 
what they will and will not 
prosecute.
She continued that she would 
not “criminalize crimes of poverty, 
or crimes of culture,” and that she 
was on a mission to decriminalize 
“many things.” She noted that she 
always tries to examine each case 
and often asks herself how she 
can help children without hurting 
them.
The last question asked 
of Brackney called for an 
examination of the political 
position that the Commonwealth

On Thursday, a car in the 
parking garage of the Rob-
ert Mehrabian Collaborative 
Innovation Center (CIC) caught 
?re. The ?re ?lled the ?rst ?oor 
of the CIC with smoke, but no 
one was injured in the incident, 
according to Jason Maderer, the 
senior director of Carnegie Mellon 
media relations.
Students and staff were 
evacuated from the CIC at 
approximately 2:40 p.m. It was 
pouring rain outside and most 
people gathered under a covered 
space near the main entrance of 
the building.
“It smelled like plastic burn-
ing when we walked out,” said 
Tricia Flinn, a Senior Technical 
Writer & Content Strategist in 
SEI, who regretted leaving her 
laptop inside. “It’s just that I’m on 
a deadline. But all the people are 
out and that’s what matters.”
Many people weren’t sure why 
they had been evacuated, but 
remained calm through the ordeal. 
Carnegie Mellon security of?cer 
Justin Iaquinta was informed of a 
?re in the garage but did not know 
any other details. Many exiting 
the building waited inside Newell-
Simon Hall while waiting for the 
CIC to be cleared.
Thomas Ogden, Carnegie 
Mellon Police Chief, said that 
the main safety concern on the 
situation was the smoke produced 
by the downstairs ?re. “The whole 
building is ?lled with smoke,” he 
said, as safety of?cials evacuated 
the building.
Honeywell set to launch new robotics center in Strip District
See FIRE, A3See FORUM, A3
ADAM TUNNARD
News Editor
North Carolina-based Fortune 
100 conglomerate Honeywell is 
constructing a new robotics facility 
in the Strip District, building 
upon existing relationships in 
Pittsburgh.
Honeywell operates four 
business units: Honeywell 
Aerospace, Home and Building 
Technologies (HBT), Safety and 
Productivity Solutions (SPS), and 
Honeywell Performance Materials 
and Technologies. 
The new facility will house 
Honeywell Robotics, a division 
focusing on applying arti?cial 
intelligence and advanced robotics 
for use in warehouse automation 
and e-commerce distribution.
The company joins the likes of 
Argo AI, Uber, Apple, Bombardier, 
and Facebook in what is now called 
Robotics Row, a dense collection 
of tech companies who’ve found 
a home in Pittsburgh’s former 
wholesale district. Honeywell 
will take over a 25,000 square 
foot space previously occupied 
by Robert Bosch in the Strip’s 3 
Crossings business development.
In a company press release, 
Pieter Krynauw, president of 
Honeywell Intelligrated, said 
that “Honeywell has been at the 
forefront of warehouse automation 
technology for more than 25 
years helping customers improve 
productivity and ef?ciency.”
They hope the automation 
solutions provided by this new 
branch will address what they see 
as a labor shortage in the growing 
e-commerce market.
Joseph Lui, a former IoT and 
Robotics head at Amazon, is set 
to be the General Manager of 
Honeywell Robotics. In an email 
statement to The Tartan, he 
says that the corporation chose 
the Strip District for this facility 
due to its proximity to Carnegie 
Mellon University and the den-
sity of robotics professionals in the 
region.
“Our decision to set up 
Honeywell Robotics was to stay 
close to advanced robotics and 
software development talent,” 
he said, citing Honeywell’s 
collaboration with researchers 
at Carnegie Mellon University’s 
National Robotics Engineering 
Center (NREC). The company ?rst 
partnered with the NREC in 2017 
to develop robotics technologies 
for distribution centers.
Lui says Honeywell has created 
a “strong bond” with researchers 
at the NREC, and wanted “to stay 
close to one of the largest robotics 
communities in the world.”
“The relationships we’ve built 
with the NREC and Honeywell’s 
history in Pittsburgh — our voice 
technology business, which 
makes voice-guided systems 
for warehouse and distribution 
centers, is in the area — makes the 
city, and where we’re speci?cally 
located in Robotics Row, a great 
place to be,” Lui said, referring 
to Honeywell’s Vocollect product 
development in the company’s 
Penn Hills facility.
Lui can’t say for certain if any 
of the staff of the new facility will 
come from Carnegie Mellon, but 
notes that “we hope they will.” 
Honeywell is “actively recruiting” 
staff for the robotics center, Lui 
says, seeking arti?cial intelligence 
and robotics experts, software 
engineers, program managers, 
computer vision scientists, and 
several types of engineers.
Honeywell wants “to bring to-
gether some of the brightest minds, 
partnerships and investments to 
create breakthrough technological 
advancements for customers of all 
sizes, and ultimately deliver values 
to end-consumers,” said Lui.

Corrections & Clari?cations
Last week, we published an article titled “ForAllSecure, a

characterized a DIU contract as being signed only with 
ForAllSecure.  ForAllSecure is actually working with multiple 
design partners under the DIU contract.
In another article, titled “Alum Sarah Valentine discusses her

Car ?re under CIC prompts evacuationCharlottesville chief of police holds Q&A  
Make Possible, Carnegie Mellon’s newest fundraising effort
WILSON EKERN
Copy Manager
Make Possible, Carnegie 
Mellon’s nine-year, $2 billion 
fundraising project has just 
entered its public phase. The 
announcement came with a new 
website, and a video that featured 
faculty, staff, students, and 
trustees showcasing some of the 
projects and performances under 
development at the university.
The campaign, which began in 
the ?scal year 2016, has already 
raised over half of its goal from 
more than 42,000 supporters.
The Make Possible Campaign 
is structured around 4 pillars: 
“accelerating technological 
advancements to bene?t humanity; 
fueling artistic expression and 
creative inquiry to shape modern 
culture; achieving breakthroughs 
in discovery by transforming 
how scienti?c inquiry is pursued; 
and fostering a dynamic experi-
ence that enables CMU students 
to thrive,” according to the press 
release.
The campaign will direct 
resources to each of the schools and 
colleges at Carnegie Mellon, which 
will help the university “tackle 
the challenges whose solutions 
lie at the nexus of technology 
and humanity,”  said university 
president Farnham Jahanian in a 
letter about the campaign and in 
the accompanying video.
In an interview with The Tartan, 
Scott Mory, vice president for 
University Advancement, echoed 
this sentiment, stressing the 
“emphasis again on being at the 
nexus of technology and humanity, 
and how that really can encompass 
all parts of the university,” from 
the Tepper School of Business to 
the College of Fine Arts.
When asked about speci?c 
improvements students would see 
from this massive in?ux of capital, 
Mory said that students are “going 
to see some real improvements in 
the quality of life on campus,” with 
the campaign seeking to “improve 
facilities for health, wellness, and 
athletics.”
From a “$50 million dollar gift 
for undergraduate scholarships,” 
to “the launch of the Tartan 
scholars program,” to the 
installation of “a chair for the 
director of civic engagement to 
provide new resources for SLICE 
[Student Leadership, Involvement, 
and Civic Engagement],” the 
campaign “will have a lot of direct 
impacts on student life, and of 
course, as an alum of the university, 
the increased reputation of the 
university, as it’s able to use these 
resources to advance its mission…
will have a long term bene?t for 
every alum of Carnegie Mellon,” 
Mory said.
The Make Possible campaign, 
in addition to endowing dean’s 
chairs and providing funds for 
undergraduate research, includes 
capital projects like the Tepper 
Quad and the Hazelwood-based 
Mill 19, a joint project between 
Carnegie Mellon’s Manufacturing 
Futures Initiative and the 
nonpro?t Advanced Robotics for 
Manufacturing. According to an 
article from 90.5 WESA, Mill 19, 
a former steel mill, will be “a high-
tech resource for manufacturers in 
the region,” testing new ways to 
automate manufacturing tasks.
Another project under the 
Make Possible umbrella is the 
Block Center for Technology and 
Society, which seeks to “[ensure] 
that the bene?ts of technological 
change are widely shared, opening 
new paths to prosperity for all,” by 
investigating the ways technologies 
like AI and automation can be used 
without concentrating the bene?ts 
in the hands of a few people, 
or negatively impacting those 
whose jobs are displaced due to 
automation.
The Make Possible Campaign’s 
section on Technology and 
Humanity says Carnegie Mellon is 
“changing the way we live, work 
and connect to one another for 
good.” As Jahanian puts it, “this 
is our moment. If we are very 
intentional, if we are unapologeti-
cally bold, and if we commit to tak-
ing risks, Carnegie Mellon will take 
the lead in writing the story of this 
century... I’m excited to see what 
we’ll make possible, together.”Rebecca Enright/Art Editor
The Pittsburgh Fire 
Department and Carnegie Mellon 
police responded to the incident, 
according to Maderer, as did 
Carnegie Mellon’s Environmental 
Health & Safety, Facilities 
Management and Enterprise Risk 
Management.
The ?re was extinguished by 
3:15 p.m. Fans were used to clear 
out the smoke and people were 
able to re-enter the CIC at about 
4:00 p.m. “12 straight sunny days 
and this happens today,” Ogden 
said, referring to how people had 
to wait outside in the rain.
Carnegie Mellon’s Enviromen-
tal Health and Saftey depart-
ment’s guidelines suggest that in 
the event of a ?re, those involved 
should evacuate calmly, listen 
for instructions, crawl below the 
smoke, test doors for heat care-
fully, avoid using elevators, and 
avoid re-entering the building 
until directed.

reporting to this article.

Attorney is put in. 
A student asked, “how do they 
push for progress in an electable 
position where they might be 
voted out?”
Brackney responded, “I tell 
people that if you lose your job, 
that’s when you use all the tools in 
your bag. You use all your media, 
all your connections, and all your 
friends because it is necessary to 
be extremely intentional when 
dismantling structural issues.”
Brackney’s last comment was a 
call-to-action to each student and 
faculty in the room: to be more 
intentional, more bold, and a little 
bit louder, because breaking down 
issues won’t be done softly and 
without direction.
As she went around the room, 
she took each student’s hands, 
asked them their name, repeated it 
back to them, and smiled brightly.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
Reducing loneliness key to improving wellness at CMU
It’s no secret that college can be 
a challenging environment, and 
Carnegie Mellon is no exception. 
Last week, on Tartan Community 
Day, Dietrich professor David 
Creswell presented the results of 
the Life@CMU study, a project 
that began in 2017 to attempt 
to quantify aspects of students’ 
wellbeing. Although our campus 
has been engaging in an ongoing 
conversation on mental health, 
this study made the topic feel less 
abstract and more approachable.
The results of the research 
suggest that Carnegie Mellon isn’t 
particularly more stressful than 
other colleges. That leads to the 
million-dollar question: why do 
Carnegie Mellon students dub the 
school a soul-sucking institution 
or give it catchphrases like “fun 
dies at Carnegie Mellon”?
The phrase “stress culture” 
oversimplifies the scope of the 
problem our campus faces. It 
is easy to assume stress culture 
simply refers to students’ stress 
levels. If this were the case, the 
research that suggests Carnegie 
Mellon isn’t abnormally stressful 
compared to other college 
campuses would dispel the 
claim of a distinct stress culture. 
However, the concept of stress 
culture extends further than the 
pressure to excel in the classroom 
or earn a prestigious summer 
internship.
Our culture equates more work 
to better work. Life@CMU found 
that the average student goes to 
bed at 2:23 a.m. and wakes up 
at 9:30 a.m., making the average 
amount of sleep close to 7 hours 
per night. However, the study also 
found that students estimated 
that their classmates slept an 
average of 5.6 hours. This flawed 
perception can push students to 
get fewer hours to match up with 
their concept of the “average 
student.” If they sleep more than 
their classmates, what does that 
say about their own productivity 
and progress? Logically, it doesn’t 
say anything in and of itself. 
Harder work doesn’t mean better 
work, and sleep deprivation has 
been shown to have a serious 
impact on students’ performance. 
Still, students internalizing and 
glorifying an unhealthy lifestyle 
can cause hits to their mental 
health.
Isolation is another detriment 
to students’ mental health. The 
Life@CMU findings suggested 
loneliness increases as the 
semester progresses, making 
students more susceptible to 
stress and depression. On top of 
the pressures of being a college 
student, students may feel 
pressured to maintain an image 
that hides struggles or perceived 
“weakness.” This pressure can 
further exacerbate isolation and 
thus cause further mental health 
problems.
This leads to one of the larger 
gaps on our college campus: 
the lack of dialogue. Even if 
students are cognizant that 
Carnegie Mellon is not an easy 
place to be, going from being 
a big fish in a small pond to 
swimming in a large ocean is a 
daunting experience for anyone. 
Events like Fresh Check Day are 
appreciated, but we 
need more consistent 
initiatives throughout 
the year to provide support 
for students and to continuously 
show that they are not alone in 
their struggles. It’s difficult to 
handle the responsibilities of a 
college student. Combining that 
with mental illnesses, difficult 
in their own right, creates a 
weight that is impossible to carry 
alone. By not having dialogue, 
students may feel alone in their 
experiences and consequently 
isolate themselves.
This is not a task that 
students can tackle on their own. 
Despite the 2017 expansion of 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services (CaPS), students are 
often faced with long wait times 
between appointments, assuming 
they can even 
schedule an appointment 
at all. Students have also 
expressed dissatisfaction with 
the services offered at CaPS. This 
demonstrates a need for more 
comprehensive mental health 
resources for students. Students 
need a space where they can 
get adequate care, including 
individual therapy sessions and 
group therapy programs, without 
having to jump through hoops or 
wait for weeks.
To paraphrase Andrew 
Carnegie, our “hearts are in the 
work.” However, there comes a 
point in which we need to fill our 
hearts with more than just “the 
work.” We need to make time 
to adopt healthy lifestyles and 
maintain strong relationships 
with others. It’s not a task that 
one student or one project 
can accomplish alone; it’s a 
collaborative effort that requires 
continuous efforts and initiative 
from students, administration, 
and faculty. These forms of 
self-care and more candid 
conversations don’t promote 
self-indulgence; they promote 
responsibility.
During the ?rst annual Tartan Community Day, President Farnam Jahanian opened the presentation of Life@CMU, a project that hopes to understand how to better support students and protect their wellbeing.

Through the different 
eras of human civilization, 
gold has been considered a 
precious commodity, a word 
synonymous with wealth, 
status, and power. Thousands 
of years later, nothing has 
changed. People continue to 
seek out gold alongside other 
precious resources like silver 
and oil.
Oftentimes, physical 
assets become imbued with 
incredible value, and where 
there’s value, there’s trade. 
Although we no longer trade 
gold the old-fashioned way 
by directly exchanging gold 
bars or bullion, many people 
obtain gold by buying jewelry 
or commemorative items. 
Investing in physical jewelry 
is a common way to become 
involved, but the process of 
doing so is self-explanatory. 
Instead, we’ll focus on trading 
gold and other important assets 
like oil and silver on the stock 
market.
Buying things like gold, oil, 
and silver is considered trading 
in commodities, a very popular 
option when the market is 
taking a downturn. The reason 
is simple: precious resources 
are desired worldwide, and as 
a result, they maintain their 
value more consistently over 
time. So even if the market is 
dropping, your assets will not 
suffer significantly.
Precious resources tend to 
fluctuate in the short term 
since their valuation is likely 
to change. The price of oil, for 
instance, jumps up and down, 
as does the price of gold. If 
you’re thinking about getting 
rich off dramatic jumps in the 
market, commodities usually 
don’t spike nearly enough to 
make a meaningful difference, 
but if you’re looking for a slow, 
low-risk investment that’s 
capable of guarding against 
ailing markets, then you might 
want to consider commodities 
as a serious option.
There are many ways to trade 
commodities on the market, 
and with modern online 
systems for trading, buying 
into commodities is just as easy 
as buying stocks or funds. One 
of the easiest ways to invest 
in commodities is to buy into 
commodity-related ETFs, 
or Exchange Traded Funds. 
As we’ve discussed before, 
ETFs are baskets of different 
securities chopped up into tiny, 
low-price pieces that are then 
made available to consumers. 
ETFs that track commodities 
contain assets (and perhaps 
physical ownerships) relating 
to one specific precious 
resource, and shares of the 
ETFs are made available on 
the market. You might see a 
little more volatility in ETFs as 
compared to their underlying 
commodity, but ETFs tend to 
track their targets.
Another option is to 
buy stocks in commodity 
companies. This is a more 
indirect way of investing in the 
resources, but it makes sense: 
If the commodity is doing well, 
then the company making the 
resources is probably doing 
well too. Of course, company 
valuations depend on more 
than the commodity itself, 
and it’s entirely possible for 
a company to fail out of a 
profitable industry.
There are other options such 
as buying certificates or timed 
investments that operate based 
on future returns, but they 
are slightly more complicated 
than obtaining the usual 
investments on the market. And 
while investing in commodities 
is considered less risky than 
purchasing stocks, there is still 
the risk of losing money on an 
investment.
Next time, we will talk about 
the all-important topic of how 
to best invest in stocks and 
what indicators to look at while 
choosing your investments.

Whenever I write for this 
section, I tend to take what I 
talk about seriously. I can’t take 
the elections seriously, so by 
extension this article isn’t serious. 
Now that I have broken the fourth 
wall, let’s talk about the elections.
Recently Beto dropped out of 
the race, which was a revelation 
for anyone who wanted it to be. I 
personally hope it’s so he can focus 
on his dead punk rock career. Beto 
dropping out likely wasn’t his 
idea. I can imagine a Democrat 
?xer showing up at Beto’s house 
one day and blackmailing him. 
Either way, I don’t know why 
Beto didn’t run for the Senate in 
2020 against the guy that isn’t 
Ted Cruz (John Cornyn) in the 
?rst place. The Democrats should 
have sent a ?xer the minute Beto 
announced he was running for 
the presidency. Beto should have 
realized that almost winning 
Texas doesn’t mean you can win 
the country.
But it shouldn’t be surprising 
that Beto dropped out. In fact, 
there are so many people who 
should drop out next (I won’t 
name names) but still want to lead 
the country. Here’s my question.
Why?
If you’re not polling in the 
double digits, and you have a 
better shot at positions better 
suited for you, why do you keep 
trying? Being the president looks 
awful. Obama lost thirty years of 
his lifespan in the span of eight 
years. I even feel bad for Trump, 
too. He hasn’t had time to golf 
more than three times a week. 
More importantly, if Democrats 
want to win the election, why are 
they giving people more than 5 
options, let alone 20? Americans 
aren’t good at choosing things. 
We can barely choose which sob 
story to vote for on America’s Got 
Talent.
The in?ghting also doesn’t 
help the Democrats. It’s a sad day 
when two war hawks in the party 
are ?ghting each other on Twitter 
about who is a better war hawk. 
I, of course, refer to everyone’s 
favorite Clinton and every 
Indian’s favorite politician, Tulsi 
Gabbard. The debates don’t help 
either. They’re all shams, but I’m 
glad NBC, CNN, and whoever else 
hosted it made a good amount 
of money. All I’ve learned in the 
whole ordeal is that there are 
more people who think public-
private partnerships are a good 
idea than there should be.
I don’t know if the Democrats 
have the chance of winning next 
year on their own merits. Either 
Trump is going to continue putting 
his foot in his mouth to the point 
that he alienates everyone who 
isn’t a hardcore supporter, or he 
wins again because of the sheer 
incompetence of the Democrats. 
No one should be shocked that 
the Democrats are aloof. After all, 
that’s what happens when the one 
percent who get corporate money 
try to relate to the lowly citizens, 
barring a few.
There’s nothing else to say that 
is useful. Everything’s a mess, and 
the world is near the end. Just go 
vote. They give out free stickers 
that make you feel important. 
Isn’t that all we need to feel at this 
point?

At the end of every week, I ?nd 
myself sitting on my bed with my 
laptop open and music playing. 
Across from me are my suitemates, 
giggling and catching up after a 
long week of classes, tests, and 
activities. As the clock nears 1 a.m., 
our laughs fade and the music 
grows somber as the conversation 
shifts to the topic it always ends up 
being: existing at Carnegie Mellon 
University as underrepresented 
minorities. Whether we’re talking 
about stares, treatment, or 
undisguised disrespect, we often 
think of the looming question that 
many students like ourselves face 
at Carnegie Mellon: Do we belong 
here?
I grapple with this question 
almost every day, even knowing 
that I am part of the upper-middle 
class. Nonetheless, the post-
Celebration of Diversity fantasy of 
an all-inclusive Carnegie Mellon 
community has faded. It’s not just 
me who feels this way. Time and 
time again, I have seen the blatant 
disrespect and struggles that 
underrepresented minorities face 
on campus. With so few Native 
American students at Carnegie 
Mellon — only six in the class of 
2023 — I cannot even begin to 
fathom what “belonging” means 
to them. To scope out whether or 
not underrepresented minorities 
feel they belong, I opened up a 
form for students to express their 
sentiments.
“Yes and no,” John, a ?rst-
year in CFA replied. “I know that 
I deserve to be here because I 
worked as hard as everyone else 
and [I] have something of value to 
offer. However, the institution itself 
is not designed to accommodate 
underrepresented students and 
instead decides to cater to the 
majority — in CMU’s case, white 
and East Asian students.”
“Not really,” responds Monica, 
a sophomore in Dietrich College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences.“I 
just feel a little isolated at times, 
and when I walk around certain 
buildings — Gates, for example — 
I feel like people know that I, as a 
Black person, don’t belong there.”
“Yes,” Ralph, a CIT sophomore 
says. “I worked just as hard to get 
here as anyone else.”
“The simplest answer is no,” 
Jessie, a sophomore in MCS, 
states. “Not only am I one of the 
few women in my major, but I am 
the only black woman.”
“I feel like I belong within the 
Black community,” says Lisa, a 
junior in CIT. “But in Carnegie 
Mellon as a whole, probably not.”
The most rampant form 
of disrespect faced by 
underrepresented minorities 
at Carnegie Mellon is 
microaggressions, comments or 
actions that unconsciously or 
unintentionally express prejudices 
toward minorities. Most responses 
to the form, which asked about 
students’ relationship with race 
since being at Carnegie Mellon, 
discussed the insidious nature of 
microaggressions.
“I know people who just think 
of it as being normal because the 
number of microaggressions [is] 
too tiring to pay any mind to,” John 
states. “From racial assumptions 
based [on] where someone is 
from, to faculty focusing solely 
on Eurocentric curricula, there 
isn’t a sense of urgency or priority 
towards minority stories or 
history.”
“I get called the wrong name 
all the time,” Monica shares. 
“Whenever I am in a space with 
more than one Black woman, I am 
always mistaken for the other one. 
It’s a bit aggravating.”
“A lot of people seem afraid 
to converse with me, even my 
neighbor right down the hall who 
I see every day,” says Olivia, a ?rst-
year student in Tepper. “It just 
seems kind of weird sometimes. It’s 
like they’ve never seen someone 
who looks like me before.”
Other times the 
microaggressions are more 
blatant.
As Ralph puts it, “It’s always 
small comments from others 
when people say ‘I can’t relate’ 
because I’m Mexican, or when 
they comment that I’m one of the 
few Mexicans on campus. They’re 
comfortable crossing these verbal 
boundaries and saying these 
insensitive things, often without 
realizing how it makes me feel.”
“I’m undermined so often, even 
when asking for help,” shares 
Lisa. “And this is something that 
happened when I was trying to get 
help from a TA.”
“My race and ethnicity have 
been tied to my socioeconomic 
status from friends of mine,” 
shares Zachary, a sophomore in 
CIT. “And it feels like they have set 
lower bars for me simply for being 
a minority.”
“Many of my authority ?gures 
are racist,” Jessie states. “I’ve had 
teaching assistants take one look at 
my skin and ask me which part of 
Africa I am from. When I complain, 
they say they are just trying to get 
to know me and my heritage better. 
But is it not racist to ask every 
black person you encounter which 
part of Africa they are from?”
Microaggressions, as subtle as 
they can be, are mentally taxing 
for underrepresented minorities. 
Underrepresented minorities must 
exist within a space where they 
often question whether they even 
belong while dealing with the stress 
of Carnegie Mellon academics. On 
top of that, mental health is often 
disregarded and seen as shameful 
in many of our cultures, making 
effects much worse. I cannot even 
begin to describe the psychological 
toll microaggressions have on 
students right here, right now, but 
Zachary hits the nail on the head.
“I have gone through feelings 
of rejection and tried ?ghting to 
have my identity noticed here,” 
he shares. “But ultimately, I have 
grown numb to the alienating 
forces of this school’s student body. 
This is something that, sadly, I feel 
a lot of my peers have felt also.”
Our students should not be 
feeling numb and helpless due 
to parts of their identity they 
cannot change; however, it is not 
surprising. Why is there such a 
lack of outrage from not only the 
administration, but the faculty and 
the rest of the student body? What 
can Carnegie Mellon do from here 
on?
First, the institution must 
realize that diversity, equity, and 
inclusion efforts are urgent. While 
I believe the institution has the best 
intentions in efforts to “do better”, 
and our university is improving 
in comparison to accounts from 
2015, effective and direct diversity 
efforts can only come with a 
realized sense of priority. This does 
not equate to simply saying that 
you will listen, or that you care: 
Urgency demands immediate, 
thoughtful action.
Another issue Carnegie Mellon 
deals within its diversity, equity, 
and inclusion efforts is the lack of 
visibility. To clarify, I understand 
there are ongoing task forces, 
committees, and safe spaces to 
improve the state of diversity 
and inclusion here at Carnegie 
Mellon. I do not discredit the 
work of undergraduate and 
graduate students, faculty, staff, 
and professors who are working 
toward the creation of programs, 
scholarships, and resources. 
However, I know of these efforts 
because I happen to be part of 
them. What about students who are 
not? Or students who are applying 
to Carnegie Mellon? Students from 
marginalized groups should not be 
lost when they feel uncomfortable 
or alone.
The urgency and visibility of 
current efforts ultimately warrant 
transparency. Effective diversity, 
equity, and inclusion efforts 
require complete honesty with 
how things are now. Why are we, in 
a way, lying to students? Whether 
it is to prospective or current 
students, why are we patting 
ourselves on the back for a job well 
done, when we also know the job 
is far from being done? Several of 
the students interviewed shared 
feelings of being disillusioned 
during the Celebration of Diversity 
weekends that are offered a few 
times a year.
“Like many college 
advertisements, the weekend was 
a distortion of the true diversity 
of the campus and the associated 
resources it offers,” states Kyle, a 
senior in Dietrich College.
“Celebration of Diversity made 
me feel like I ?nally had a space to 
learn and grow without having 
to worry about the color of 
my skin every minute,” Jessie 
re?ects. “But my ?rst few weeks 
of college confused me. This 
wasn’t the representation that 
was presented at the diversity 
weekend.”
“The best part of it was 
connecting with other students 
applying,” shares David, a 
sophomore in Dietrich College. 
“It’s unfortunate, though, 
because I don’t even remember 
the programs or panels.”
When discussing 
transparency in Carnegie 
Mellon’s diversity, equity, and 
inclusion efforts, David and 
I re?ect on the Building Our 
Network of Diversity Luncheon 
that we both attended in 
September. Being transparent 
would facilitate diversity 
efforts and invoke real change, 
allowing students to trust the 
administration.
However, as we observed at 
this luncheon, the institution 
refuses to acknowledge faults. 
Following an excessive twenty-
minute faculty introduction, the 
Of?ce of Admissions presented 
data showing the increase of 
“low-yielding underrepresented 
students” and women from 
2015 to now. The Of?ce of 
Administration did not present 
numbers on a school-to-school 
basis, avoiding acknowledging 
that many of our undergraduate 
schools have serious racial and 
class diversity issues.
“I understand not wanting to 
show numbers that go against you,” 
David re?ects. “But pretending 
does so much more damage.”
The Admissions Of?ce and 
faculty also invoked The Tyranny 
of the Meritocracy by Lani Guinier. 
The book, which discusses the 
broken education system that 
exists in the United States, was a 
microscopic band-aid of an excuse 
— because of the “way things are,” 
there is only so much that Carnegie 
Mellon can do. If the institution 
can quietly raise over $1 billion 
for multiple high-tech, modern 
buildings, and thirty endowed 
faculty chairs, they can spare a 
dollar for effective recruitment 
methods.
“Carnegie Mellon wants to 
hold us, the students, to certain 
standards,” David says of the 
matter. “But the institution should 
also be held to the same standard.”
Why has there not been urgency, 
visibility, and transparency in 
diversity and inclusion efforts in 
the ?rst place? If my time here 
has taught me anything, it is 
this: Carnegie Mellon University 
fosters a culture of political apathy 
which in effect, makes 
urgency, visibility, and 
transparency in current 
efforts less important to 
the administration. Why take 
direct action when it is easier to 
pretend?
Political apathy is the lack of 
interest in the state of politics. I 
understand to a certain extent 
the implications, especially 
for international students, of 
taking a public political stance, 
and I certainly do not blame 
them as individuals. I am more 
disconcerted with Carnegie 
Mellon’s pledge for diversity and 
inclusion efforts as the institution 
itself treads lightly in politics and 
taking action. Simply put, diversity 
and inclusion are inherently 
political projects.
For example, Carnegie Mellon 
cannot pledge support for Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals 
(DACA) students, while partnering 
with Palantir Technologies, a 
top software company that has 
given important technologies 
to Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE). Carnegie 
Mellon cannot grant themselves 
the badge of “doing better” while 
our professors bene?t from 
telescopes placed on sacred land 
and encourage the construction 
of the Thirty Meter Telescope. 
Carnegie Mellon cannot simply 
hire more faculty members of 
color while current faculty lack the 
training necessary to interact and 
positively connect with students 
from marginalized groups. The 
institution cannot promise to listen 
to the student body’s concerns and 
then do little productive action 
beyond listening. They are putting 
on an act, and I am not buying it.
At this point, I am desperate. 
I am begging. By refusing to 
acknowledge the intersection 
between diversity efforts and 
politics in the American context, 
the administration is complicit in 
the suffering of underrepresented 
minorities at Carnegie Mellon. 
With a complicit administration 
comes a complicit student body, 
and that is unacceptable. We have 
suffered and continue to suffer in 
silence.

Removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to halt climate change
ASHWIN SRINIVASAN
SciTech Editor
With ever-increasing emissions 
and climate change, removing 
greenhouse gases such as carbon 
dioxide from the atmosphere is of 
critical importance. Researchers 
at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology (MIT) have 
developed a means of removing 
carbon dioxide from a stream of 
air that functions at nearly any 
concentration level, making the 
technology far more versatile than 
others before.
MIT postdoctoral student 
Sahag Voskian, who worked under 
Chemical Engineering Professor 
Ralph Landau, published the 
?ndings in the journal Energy 
and Environmental Science. 
His technique involves forcing 
air through a stack of charged 
electrochemical plates, and 
releasing gas as the electrodes 
charge up. Previous attempts 
at carbon dioxide removal have 
required higher concentrations 
of the gas in the air, but Voskian’s 
device requires signi?cantly less 
energy and works under more 
conditions.
“The greatest advantage of this 
technology over most other carbon 
capture or carbon-absorbing 
technologies is the binary nature of 
the adsorbent’s af?nity to carbon 
dioxide,” explained Voskian in an 
MIT press release. The electrodes 
are coated with a carbon nano-
tube-based compound called 
polyanthraquinone, so they have a 
natural af?nity for carbon dioxide 
molecules and react with the gas 
even at low concentrations. The 
device can even supply some of 
the power required for the process 
of ejecting the carbon dioxide gas, 
unlike alternative methods that 
require substantial input energy, 
often in the form of heat.
Voskian continued, “This binary 
af?nity allows capture of carbon 
dioxide from any concentration, 
including 400 parts per million, 
and allows its release into any 
carrier stream, including 100 
percent CO2.” In other words, 
carbon dioxide will be emitted 
from the device regardless of the 
gas blown through its electro-
chemical plates. A common use 
case may be for the carbonation of 
bottled beverages, currently done 
by burning fossil fuels to generate 
the necessary carbon dioxide gas.
“In my laboratories, we have 
been striving to develop new 
technologies to tackle a range of 
environmental issues that avoid the 
need for thermal energy sources, 
changes in system pressure, or 
addition of chemicals to complete 
the separation and release cycles,” 
Hatton added. “This carbon 
dioxide capture technology is a 
clear demonstration of the power 
of electrochemical approaches 
that require only small swings in 
voltage to drive the separations.”
The electrodes can be 
manufactured using existing 
technologies, making the device 
relatively inexpensive to produce. 
On a larger scale, the cost can 
be reduced to around tens of 
dollars per square meter of the 
electrodes. More importantly, 
Voskian’s system consistently uses 
approximately one gigajoule of 
energy per ton of carbon dioxide 
captured. Other methods of 
carbon dioxide capture can use 
up to 10 gigajoules per ton and 
are composed of more expensive 
components
The researchers are commer-
cializing the device through a new 
company called Verdox and hope 
to build a pilot plant within the 
coming years. Voskian believes 
it will be easy to scale up from 
there: “If you want more capacity, 
you just need to make more 
electrodes.”
“The greatest advantage of this technology over 
most other carbon capture or carbon absorbing 
technologies is the binary nature of the 
adsorbent’s af?nity to carbon dioxide.”

Astronomers at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) using the European Southern Observatory’s SPHERE instrument have identi?ed an asteroid known as Hygiea, which could be considered a dwarf planet. The object is 
the fourth-largest in the asteroid belt, and high-resolution study of its surface have led researchers to believe it could take the title of of smallest dwarf planet in the solar system. The team of scientists, led by Pierre 
Vernazza from the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Marseille in France, determined that Hygiea’s diameter is approximately 430 kilometers, compared to Ceres’ 950 kilometers and Pluto’s nearly 2400 kilometers.

A group of American 
researchers have discovered 
an antibody against potentially 
lethal in?uenza viruses in mice. 
The antibody may assist in the 
development of a universal ?u 
shot capable of either treating or 
preventing every ?u strain. The 
study was conducted at Scripps 
Research alongside St. Louis’ 
Washington University School of 
Medicine and New York’s Icahn 
School of Medicine at Mount 
Sinai and was 
published in Science 
on Oct. 25.
Ian Wilson, Hansen 
Professor of Structural Biology 
at Scripps Research, is one of 
three senior co-authors of the 
study. According to Wilson, the 
antibody under study binds to 
neuraminidase, a protein that 
plays a vital role in inducing the 
replication of the ?u virus in the 
body. This protein is found on 
the virus’ surface, and triggers 
the release of the virus from 
infected host cells, thereby 
allowing it to spread throughout 
the body. The ?u medicine 
Tami?u, most commonly used 
to treat dangerously severe ?us, 
accomplishes this through the 
inactivation of neuraminidase. 
Even so, there exists a variety of 
forms of neuraminidase as they 
can vary depending on the ?u 
strain. As a result, drugs such 
as Tami?u are not always very 
effective. Worse, these drugs 
decrease in effectiveness even 
more with each passing year, 
since the ?u virus develops a 
resistance to these drugs.
“There are many strains of 
in?uenza virus that circulate 
so every year we have to 
design and produce a new 
vaccine to match the most 
common strains of that 
year. Now imagine if we 
could have one vaccine 
that protected against 
all in?uenza strains, 
including: human, swine 
and other highly lethal 
avian in?uenza viruses. 
This antibody could be the 
key to [the] design of a truly 
universal vaccine,” said co-
senior author and assistant 
professor of immunology 
and pathology at Washington 
University, Ali Ellebedy in a 
Scripps press release.
Ellebedy was the ?rst to 
discover the antibody in 2017 at 
Barnes-Jewish Hospital. It was 
hidden in blood drawn from a 
patient who was stricken with the 
?u. While working on a different 
study with the Washington 
University Emergency Care and 
Research Core investigating the 
human immune response to 
?u infection, Ellebedy received 
a multitude of blood samples 
from consenting ?u victims. 
One of these blood samples 
was unusual, as it contained 
antibodies that acted against 
the main protein located on the 
virus’s surface, hemagglutinin, as 
well as antibodies that targeted 
something else entirely.
“At the time we were just 
starting, and I was setting up 
my lab so we didn’t have the 
tools to look at what else the 
antibodies could be targeting,” 
said Ellebedy. Three of the 
?u samples were sent 
to another co-senior 
author, a microbiology 
professor at the Icahn 
School of Medicine 
at Mount Sinai, 
Florian Krammer, 
Ph.D. As an expert 
on neuraminidase, 
Krammer tested the 
antibodies he re-
ceived from Ellebedy 
against many neur-
aminidase proteins. 
One of these antibodies 
was capable of blocking 
neuraminidase activity in 
every known type of neuramini-
dase in ?u viruses; these proteins 
were found in both human and 
nonhuman strains.
“The breadth of the antibodies 
really came as a surprise to us. 
Typically, anti-neuraminidase 
antibodies can be broad within 
a subtype, like H1N1, but an 
antibody with potent activity 
across subtypes was unheard of. 
At ?rst, we did not believe our 
results. Especially the ability of 
the antibodies to cross between 
in?uenza A and in?uenza B 
viruses is just mind-boggling. 
It is amazing what the human 
immune system is capable of 
if presented with the right 
antigens,” said Krammer in a 
Scripps press release.
Krammer and his colleagues 
gave the antibodies to mice 
who were dosed with a lethal 
quantity of in?uenza virus in 
order to determine whether the 
antibodies were able to treat 
severe ?us. They were all capable 
of protecting against multiple 
strains; one in particular, 1G01, 
was able to cure all of the twelve 
tested strains.
“All the mice survived, even 
if they were given the antibody 
72 hours after infection. They 
de?nitely got sick and lost weight, 
but we still saved them. It was 
remarkable,” Ellebedy added. “It 
made us think that you might be 
able to use this antibody in an 
intensive care scenario when you 
have someone sick with ?u and 
it’s too late to use Tami?u.”
The discovery of this 
antibody is nothing short of 
groundbreaking, as it tells 
scientists that they may have 
to take an entirely different 
approach to deal with particularly 
severe ?u cases, as well as ?u 
pandemics. In the near future, 
severe cases of the ?u may be a 
thing of the past.

service ace by junior Julia Kim 
opened the scoring for the 
Carnegie Mellon side. Both teams 
traded points for the rest of the 
set, however, and it progressed 
much like the ?rst, ?nishing 25-
16 in favor of the Tartans.
Southwestern gave the third 
set their best effort, reaching 
set point with a four-point lead, 
consecutive well-placed kills, 
a service ace from Yew, and 
a strong block by Foose and 
Beaudoin ensured that Carnegie 
Mellon would come back from 
behind to win the set 26-24 and 
the game 3-0.
The Tartans averaged a kill 
percentage of .298. The scoring 
distribution seemed to be more 
spread, with Beaudoin leading 
in terms of points scored at 
9.5 points out of the total 54, 
followed closely by Aqui and 
Stewart with nine points each, 
along with Foose and Cao with 
8.5 points each.
Saturday’s opponents were 
tougher. In the ?rst set of the 
match against the SUNY Geneseo 
Knights, the Tartans looked 
strong, taking the lead right away 
and winning by a formidable 
25-14. Geneseo responded 
with intensity in the second 
set, however, and scored ?ve 
consecutive points right off the 
bat. A timeout called by Carnegie 
Mellon sti?ed their momentum, 
though, and the Tartans 
responded in kind, with several 
solid kills and a service ace from 
Yan bringing the scoreline to 8-9.
The Knights then extended 
their lead to 13-10, but, once 
again, the Carnegie Mellon team 
caught up, thanks to a strong kill 
by sophomore Erin Westberg, 
an attack error on the part of 
Geneseo, and a service ace from 
Foose. The Knights still managed 
to hold off the Tartans, winning 
the set 25-17.
The third set was tightly 
contested, with both teams 
trading points all the way to 
the end of the set. Consecutive 
kills from Stewart and Beaudoin 
allowed Carnegie Mellon to take 
the set with a margin of 28-26.
The fourth set was close as 
well, but well-timed kills gave the 
Knights the set, 25-21. Geneseo 
took the lead early on in the 
?nal set, but steady attacks from 
the Tartans earned them seven 
consecutive points. Though the 
Knights attempted to respond, 
they were outmatched, and a 
service ace from Cao and forceful 
kills from Cao, Westberg, and 
Foose saw Carnegie Mellon 
emerge as the victor, winning the 
set 15-6 and the game 3-2.
The home team ?nished 
the match with an average kill 
percentage of .256, with the 
top scorer being Beaudoin once 
again, earning a total of 16 points 
out of 73.
The Saturday evening game 
against Ohio Wesleyan University 
marked the last home game 
of the season, or Senior night. 
The game itself was once again 
hotly contested, and though 
Carnegie Mellon gained a short 
lead thanks to a service ace by 
Yew, Ohio Wesleyan quickly 
caught up. However, kills from 
Beaudoin, Foose, and Westberg, 
along with a few Ohio Wesleyan 
attack errors saw the Tartans 
open up the margin — one they 
maintained till the end of the set, 
allowing them to take the ?rst set 
25-20.
Ohio Wesleyan bounced back 
in the second set, and despite 
a strong performance from 
the Tartans including service 
aces from So-Holloway and 
Cao, consecutive kills by Ohio 
Wesleyan saw the visitors steal 
away the second set 21-25.
The home team managed to 
secure a six point lead early on in 
the third set, but Ohio Wesleyan 
caught up. Both teams traded 
points, tying at 24-24 before a 
service error and a phenomenal 
block by Cao and Aqui granted 
Carnegie Mellon the victory at 
26-24. The fourth set began with 
both teams vying for a win. A 
service ace from Yew, along with 
a series of powerful kills from 
Foose, Cao, and Aqui opened up 
the margin in the beginning, and 
though Ohio Wesleyan attempted 
to ?re back, the Tartan defense 
held strong.
A ?nal offensive push saw the 
Tartans score seven consecutive 
points — two of those points 
from service aces by Yan to take 
the set 25-13 and the game 3-1.
Although the average kill 
percentage was lower compared 
to others in the same weekend at 
.214, it was still an exceptional 
senior night game. The top scorer 
was Foose, to whom 13.5 of the 
68 total points scored by Carnegie 
Mellon were attributed. With an 
individual kill percentage of .476, 
this seemed like an excellent ?nal 
home game for Foose.
These latest victories bring the 
overall win record up to 21-5 and 
the home win record up to 9-1. 
With a ?ve game winning streak, 
the Tartans look poised and ready, 
bringing incredible momentum 
into the UAA Championship 
Quarter?nal on Friday against 
New York University.
The championship, played in 
Chicago, will require the Tartans 
to win two in a row to make the 
?nal. No matter what, though, 
the team will play a consolation 
game on Saturday.
rich because they are smart and 
that they are smart because 
they are rich.” In the essay, she 
talks about how everyone in the 
writer’s room just wants to help 
the company make more money, 
but the supposed adults in the 
room — the owners of the media 
groups — refuse to play the part. 
They won’t listen to the people 
who know where the money 
comes from.
Our newspaper, The Tartan, 
doesn’t really have to worry 
about money, fortunately. We do 
sort of, but if we really got into 
trouble, the college would be 
there to help us out. Although, 
it might mean that the college 
(read: corporation) would try to 
turn us into another media of?ce 
of theirs. We would have no 
obligation to report on anything, 
except the things the corporation 
would tell us to report. Currently, 
our only obligations are to ideals 
of newspapering. I couldn’t 
imagine what it would be like 
to have another person’s agenda 
breathing down your neck, like 
the case of Deadspin.
How do I make this funny? 
It’s been, like, a news article so 
far. How am I going to dig myself 
out of this hole? First, break the 
fourth wall. Second, follow in the 
footsteps of a canonized satire. 
With the ?rst step complete, it’s 
time to “A Modest Proposal” this 
situation.
I’m inside the of?ces of 
Deadspin right now, and it’s a 
ghost town. Every desk is empty, 
but the papers and photos and 
of?ce supplies are still lying 
around. The lights are shut off, 
and the blinds are drawn. As I 
walk around the of?ce with its 
open ?oor plan and fake potted 
plants, I decide to take a peek 
at a few desks. That’s when I 
see it. A note scribbled on paper 
in blood, or just red pen, reads, 
“AHHHHHHHHH.” And on the 
next desk: “they’re eating her!” 
And on the ?nal desk: “and then 
they’re going to eat me!” Oh my 
god. What happened here? Did 
some deleterious demon destroy 
the entire staff of Deadspin? I 
had to ?nd out. My investigative 
journalism skills took over.
I traced people’s steps, their 
shoe prints outlined in blood. 
My hard-hitting journalistic 
abilities told me to follow the 
bloody prints. My hard-hitting 
journalistic abilities also told 
me to head down the ghostly 
hallway with blood splatters on 
the wall, a lonely light in a room 
at the end of the hallway, and 
gnashing jaw sounds coming 
from the room. I wasn’t scared. 
My journalism skills made me not 
scared. Because journalism isn’t 
human. It’s journalism. Anyway, 
I crept down the hallway. It 
smelled metallic. A soft, musical 
noise was drifting down the 
hallway. It was Wagner’s “Ride 
of the Valkyries.” My hand went 
to the doorknob, slowly pushing 
it open, and the gnashing sound 
stopped. There was a low growl.
I peeked around the corner.
Inside, a Babylonian beast 
with the words “G/O Media 
Group” written on the side 
was consuming the non-sports 
related content off of a rebellious 
sports news website site. In that 
instant, the website turned 
into a baby, and the baby’s 
face morphed into the logo of 
Deadspin, but it didn’t last. The 
baby’s face returned in a bright 
?ash of light. I stood in silence. A 
giant bird ripped off the ceiling. 
It revealed a cloudless sky, and I 
looked up to see the stars.

Volleyball ?nishes season with win, preps for playoffs

Fans of Carnegie Mellon 
University’s women’s volleyball 
were in for a treat last weekend, 
as the team won every single one 
of their ?nal four home games. 
The Tartans’ clean sweep began 
on Friday afternoon, in the ?rst 
game against the Hiram College 
Terriers.
Though the home team took 
an early lead, the visitors fought 
back, overtaking them by six 
points to four in the ?rst set. The 
Tartans responded immediately 
and earned six consecutive points 
— the ?nal a service ace by senior 
Kayla Yew — to make the score 
10-6. A timeout called by Hiram 
seemed to stall Carnegie Mellon’s 
momentum, but only temporarily, 
and though the Terriers scored 
several more points, they were 
unable to match the pace of the 
Tartans, who continued to score 
thanks to well-aimed kills from 
the likes of senior Erika Foose, 
along with a service ace by junior 
Diana Balta. Carnegie Mellon 
went on to win the ?rst set by an 
impressive score of 25-12.
Hiram came back strong in the 
second set, and though Carnegie 
Mellon took the lead by a margin 
of 6-1, the Terriers caught up 
quickly. Both teams traded points 
until the very end of the set. A ?nal 
push beginning with a service 
ace by Foose and continuing 
with kills by sophomores Vivian 
Beaudoin and Carrie Stewart 
gave the Tartans the second 
set with a much closer 25-22 
scoreline. Though Hiram scored 
?rst in the third set, a series of 
six kills courtesy of senior Sahara 
Aqui and Beaudoin gave Carnegie 
Mellon a sizable lead — a margin 
that only expanded as the game 
went on. With a service ace by 
sophomore Anna Cao, the Tartans 
took the set 25-12 and the game 
3-0.
The Carnegie Mellon team 
averaged a considerably strong 
kill percentage of .333, with 
Beaudoin scoring the most 
points — 12.5 points out of the 
total 51 were attributed to her.
The second game on Friday was 
against Southwestern University, 
and the Tartans started strongly, 
with a series of six points being 
scored, one being a service ace 
from senior Maia So-Holloway. 
Although Southwestern tried 
to respond, their efforts were 
outmatched and Carnegie Mellon 
won the ?rst set with a score of 
25-15, the ?nal point coming 
from an ef?cient service ace by 
?rst-year Stella Yan.
Though the beginning of 
the second set saw the visitors 
attempt to gain momentum off

NATHANIEL RICHMOND
Staffwriter
On Oct. 30, the Washington 
Nationals captured the World 
Series in Game 7 against the 
Houston Astros with a score of 
6-2. As a Washington, D.C. native 
and Nationals fan, I was obviously 
excited to see the Nationals 
capture their ?rst World Series, 
giving D.C. its ?rst World Series 
since 1924. But it was especially 
shocking to see the Nationals add 
to a remarkable turnaround in 
D.C. sports.
These Nationals had already 
done D.C. proud by being the 
?rst Washington D.C. baseball 
team to make the World Series 
since 1933. Additionally, they 
accomplished what previous 
iterations of the Nationals could 
not, in that the journey there was 
fun for the fans. The Nationals 
of the past few years were 
crushed under the weight of high 
expectations.
Bryce Harper, a former 
National League MVP and 
Nationals superstar, left for the 
Phillies in free agency before the 
2019 season, and the Nationals 
were pronounced dead before a 
game had even been played.
The Nationals seemed to be 
another D.C. team that could 
never get over the hump, going 
19-31 in their ?rst 50 games. 
The Washington Capitals the 
NHL team for Washington, 
D.C. — had won the Stanley Cup 
Championship in 2018, but they 
endured a long stretch of early 
playoff exits beforehand. The 
Nationals were never going to do 
any better than that. At least, that 
was what most people thought.
But the Nationals exploded 
after a players meeting and 
some in-season acquisitions like 
pinch hitter Gerardo Parra. The 
Nationals went 74-38 the rest of 
the way to get into the playoffs 
and battled to defeat the over 
100-win Los Angeles Dodgers 
and Astros.
Most impressive about their 
run was the culture that the 
team built for their D.C. fans. 
Like the Washington Capitals 
of 2018, the Nationals played 
relaxed and loose. The minimal 
expectations of the 2019 season 
allowed them to play freely, and 
they began to surge with this 
new mindset. Parra famously 
added to the team’s fun when he 
made his walk-up music “Baby 
Shark,” a catchy kids’ song with 
an accompanying dance.
It’s clear now how much this 
change in culture meant to the 
Nationals. They not only had fun 
and won games, but they also 
brought in a new generation of 
Nationals fans while bringing 
back some older, casual ones. 
It was clear how different these 
Nationals were when Parra came 
in to the 6th inning of games and 
Nationals Park would erupt with 
fans singing “Baby Shark.” Win or 
lose, they were a fan favorite.
Now that they have won, the 
Nationals seem to have everyone 
in D.C. paying attention (who 
isn’t a Dodgers fan). They became 
favorites in part because they 
won, but they would have still 
given D.C. a great team to root for 
had they not. Juan Soto’s goofy 
plate rituals, Sean Doolittle’s 
lightsaber skills, and the dugout 
dance parties highlighted how 
fun the Nationals were and gave 
fans more to cheer for than 
baseball. With NHL and WNBA 
championship wins since 2018, 
Washington, D.C. now has the 
MLB champions capping off the 
resurgence of D.C. sports.

I usually like to keep Penalty 
Shouts pretty short. After all, 
brevity is the soul of wit or 
something. But this past week, 
there was a news story that hit 
close to home, as the interim 
editor in chief of Deadspin was 
?red after refusing to capitulate 
to the demands of their owners, 
G/O Media Group.
Usually, Deadspin does 
exclusively sports coverage. 
However, their current owners 
recently pushed a mandate that 
boiled down to “stick to sports,” 
and sticking to sports coverage 
is not a good look for anybody. 
Exclusive sports coverage 
doesn’t make money and is often 
extremely tedious.
Additionally, the political 
suggestions of asking people 
to “stick to sports,” as Colin 
Kaepernick has been told many 
times, ignores that placing 
sports in a box where it has no 
connection to the real world 
and is simple entertainment 
means there is nothing to it. 
There is no meaning behind 
the violence perpetrated in 
any sport. The thousands of 
deaths in professional sports in 
the 20th and 21st century look 
no different than a death in a 
gladiator’s ring. We watch the 
NFL per panem et circenses.
As of Friday, all of the writing 
and editing staff at Deadspin

I walked into the movie theater, got 
my ticket scanned, and was directed to 
the IMAX auditorium. I entered only 10 
minutes before the scheduled start of the 
film and was immediately confused to find 
complete silence.
As I turned and made my way up the 
stairs to my seat, I came upon another 
striking realization: there 
is no one else in the 
auditorium. Shocked, I 
heard my slow footsteps 
echo across the room 
as I took my seat. Was 
I in the right theater? 
I walked out, checked, 
walked back in. Yep, this was the right 
one.
My echoing footsteps lead me back to 
my seat, and I wondered for a moment 
if I had made a wrong decision. There 
were no advertisements, no trailers, no 
distractions—just the sound of a movie 
playing in the neighboring auditoriums 
and the squeaking of my own chair. 
Suddenly, as the clock struck 5:15 p.m., 
the sound of a projector swooshed and 
the empty screen before me turned on.
The lights above me dimmed, and alone 
in the pitch black darkness, the surround 
sound audio boomed with the sound of 
a choir singing the “Hallelujah” part of 
Kanye’s song “Selah” — intense and quiet, 
chanting over and over until the screen all 
at once revealed a bright image, the choir

singing at an increasingly higher pitch, 
the passion in their voices palpable as the 
camera panned out. In wonder, I leaned 
forward in my seat and took in the sounds 
and sights. I had made the right decision.
Throughout Kanye West’s experimental 
concert short film, Jesus is King, director 
Nick Knight presents raw and powerful 
Gospel that captivates the soul 
in a manner undeniable and 
inspiring. There were no scripts, 
no scenes between fictional 
characters. Only raw, though 
intentional, footage of Kanye’s 
Sunday Service Choir singing 
classic Christian hymns under 
an open circle of sky light, the clouds 
visible and the sun 
shining happily on 
their faces.
I was enthralled 
by the beauty 
of the sound of 
this gospel choir 
and their pure, 
honest praise 
to Jesus Christ. 
The short film in 
itself displayed so 
many profound, 
human aspects 
of the Christian 
experience shown after the choir had a 
powerful session of praise and lovingly 
embraced one another as they wiped each 
other’s tears — from a deep-seated place 
JESUS IS KING
of misery and longing, to the joy and 
lightness that comes with the peace of the 
Holy Spirit, to the pure awe and worship 
of Jesus Christ with a heart so grateful 
the words are sung through tears, to the 
community and fellowship that comes with 
the journey. It was a beautiful experience 
to sit through, one that had me clapping, 
singing, crying, and smiling.
The film ended after a close up of a 
young child in her father’s arms, with 
Kanye singing “Use this Gospel,” a song 
about the importance of putting faith 
in the Bible, and in trusting Jesus. The 
credits rolled as “Jesus is Lord” gave 
the speakers their final boom, and the 
screen turned off. The projector swooshed 
off and the dimmed 
lights reentered the 
auditorium as I took 
in the half hour, 
unapologetic statement 
that was this film. I 
looked around in awe 
to seek the reaction 
of others in spite of 
myself, completely 
forgetting I was, still, 
the only one in the 
theater. I rose from 
my seat, my echoing 
footsteps lighter 
and the glimmering 
sunlight outside brighter. Beautiful, 
spiritual, and impactful — Jesus is King 
uplifted the energy of an empty room that 
should have been packed.
Only raw, though intentional, footage of Kanye’s Sunday Service Choir singing classic Christian hymns under an open circle of sky light, the clouds visible and the sun shining happily on their faces.

AB Concert: smallpools
and gnash
4

---------------------------------------------------

This past Saturday, I got the chance to expand my musical pool of knowledge. Not only did I get to listen to 
some indie music, a genre I usually avoid, but I also got to meet some very interesting personalities.
smallpools, a six-year-old indie pop band, kicked off the night with a selection of performances from their 
album The Science of Letting Go. True to its title, the tracks described the various stages of ending a relation-
ship, including denial, sadness, and eventual acceptance. As a single girl though, I thought some of the songs 
could be seen as describing letting go of a certain part of your life, like breaking up with a major or an activity 
that has started to turn toxic.
Towards the end of their segment, smallpools brought a rather quirky story about their name. During their 
early years, they used to google their name, only to meet results about the hazards of keeping killer whales in 
small pools. As a tribute, their subsequent performance featured a killer whale balloon being bounced among 
the audience, much to the delight of the students who eventually got to take home a souvenir.
At around 8:50, gnash was ready to take the stage. His look bore similarity to Justin Bieber’s Mumbai perfor-
mance: a loose Mickey Mouse graphic t-shirt with shorts. Performing tracks from his latest album we, gnash’s 
songs seemed to revolve around the theme of mental health. He seemed to truly hit some sensitive spots with 
the crowd with his songs, especially “insane” (“Tomorrow’s the day I might go insane”), and his special
mentions about self-love.
Now by this point, my inner cynic would have inhaled her fifth cup of black coffee and screamed, “Stop acting 
like my therapist,” and “this is not an after-school special!” I’ll admit that his persona reminded me of the
seasonally appropriate candy corn: funky-colored with a lot of sugar. The eccentric clash of neon lights with 
jewel-toned ones certainly didn’t contrast that image. And while I’ll admit that I found his music to be a little 
redundant after five songs, I certainly admired his charisma. His willingness to be vulnerable in front of the 
audience made him much loved by the audience both during and after his show.
All in all, it was a great experience and a night well spent, although I think the music of both bands might take 
more than just one performance to truly earn a place on my playlists. Personally, I’d say that the repertoire 
of smallpools fit my usual preference of alternate bands, although I certainly wouldn’t mind a gnash tune from 
time to time.

JOJO RABBIT
written by Michael Lee | Junior Staffwriter

This review contains no spoilers.
Jojo Rabbit is the latest film from Taika 
Waititi, the writer and director behind 
Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We 
do in the Shadows, and most recently 
Thor: Ragnarok. The film is essentially 
an “anti-hate satire”/coming of age 
story that happens to take place in 
Germany during the later years of 
WWII. We follow Jojo Betzler (Roman 
Griffin Davis), a 10 year old German 
boy, and his imaginary friend Adolf 
Hitler (Taika Waititi), as Jojo leads a life 
totally committed to the Hitler Youth. 
However, this worldview is challenged 
when he finds out that his mother 
(Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish 
girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in his home. 
The film also stars Rebel Wilson, Stephen 
Merchant, Sam Rockwell, Archie Yates, 
and Alfie Allen.
Before going into this film, I was 
initially a bit skeptical if this project 
was ultimately going to work out. The 
marketing and promotional materials 
seemed to focus on portraying this film 
as a satire. Mostly, I was worried about 
whether this film would be able to blend 
its emotional beats with the comedy. 
I felt that Waititi’s previous film Thor: 
Ragnarok had too much bathos, where 
emotional scenes are interrupted by 
comedic moments that didn’t allow the 
film to fully immerse the viewers into the 
story’s sentiments. It certainly didn’t help 
that this film had to tackle what was 
possibly the one of the most devastating 
periods in human history.
Fortunately, Waititi is very aware of this 
and takes a more sensitive approach 
to this story than he did in his previous 
films. The themes of tolerance and anti-
hate that the film had to handle are all 
well-employed within the story without 
being preachy. Even though the film 

---------------------------------------------------

7
has its share of satirical elements, it is self-
aware and makes sure they don’t overstay their 
welcome. I’d argue the large portion of the 
film’s comedy doesn’t even come from Waititi’s 
performance as an imaginary Adolf Hitler. He 
is portrayed as an imbecile for comic relief, but 
the story maintains its focus by portraying all 
events from the protagonist Jojo’s perspective.
Roman Griffin Davis’s performance of Jojo 
is absolutely the centerpiece that makes 
this film work. Just like the film itself, he is 
funny, charming, and fully captures the heart-
wrenching moments whenever the story 
needs it. His chemistry with both McKenzie 
and Johansson is also joyful, and their 
performances are also charming. The entire 
supporting cast is lovable regardless of 
which side of the war they support, and 
the goodwill that these characters build for 
themselves truly make the darker parts of the 
film work effectively.
Another important aspect the film got right 
is its balancing of tones. The humorous and 
heartfelt tones are fully employed within a 
scene without one taking over the other. Waititi 
completely nailed the balance of tones and 
made a film genuinely full of heart.
The only flaw that I would point out in this film 
is that the story doesn’t have a ton of buildup 
during its second act. Having a slower first act 
to have the audience invest in the characters 
is great, and it is something I want filmmakers 
to do more often. However, it became an 
issue for me by the second act when there 
was not much story buildup. There were also 
beats within the third act that I felt were a bit 
predictable.
However, none of these flaws prevent Jojo 
Rabbit from being the film it needs to be: 
a crowdpleaser that utilizes its characters 
well to do justice to the time period that it is 
portraying. It is sincere and tackles its anti-
hate themes incredibly well. Jojo Rabbit is 
currently playing in theaters nationwide.

The Frame Gallery, on the corner of 
Margaret Morrison and Forbes Avenue, 
opened its Kilo of Green showing on 
Thursday, Oct. 31. The gallery featured 
artists including Paola Mathus, Miranda 
Miller, and Jenn Gooch.
The first painting that I stumbled across 
was Mathus’s “What’s Not Lost in the River, 
2018.” By combining different mediums, 
Mathus was able to flawlessly overlay 
two very different scenes on one canvas. 
Mathus brought forth gripping images that 
distinguished themselves against the other 
white-textured foreground. This imagery of 
two foregrounds coexisting in this painting 
brings forth a reflection of the duality of 
the sacrifices we make, the ways that our 
identities intersect, and the journeys that 
we undertake because of those sacrifices 
and intersections.
Miranda Miller’s “Allohmon yellow,” was 
a three-hour performance where Miller 
was enclosed in a three-walled room of 
translucent plastic, and used their body to 
coat the room in a version of Pittsburgh’s 
proprietary paint color, Allohmon yellow. 
After they covered the room, they divided

the wall that separated them from the 
audience. The performer took up space 
in the room by lying still in a dominant 
seated position for two hours while the 
audience viewed them. The picture itself 
is of a sectioned-off part of the room after 
the performance had finished, and the 
artist was seated. The picture includes the 
tub of paint, a section of the performer’s 
outstretched legs, and a portion of the 
room. The room is not just covered 
in paint, but drenched with it, almost 
drowning in it. The yellow of Pittsburgh 
is painted on everything we do here. All 
the actions we take, good or bad, are 
covered in Allohmon yellow, drowning in 
the pigment. Miller describes the piece as 
a golden triangle, a marking of territory, a 
reclamation.
Coco Allred’s “Magnificent Retro Lounger, 
2017” was situated openly in the center 
of the room. The uneven texture was 
reminiscent of a piece of furniture, long 
overused and tired, that would surely 
crumble if any person tried to use it. The 
shade of the couch was a sickly green, 
mirroring its decaying state. It’s clear that 
at one point this couch could have been 
beautiful, a staple in the home of a proud 
owner, but now as it decays, it has become 
wretched and tired. Perhaps, it is simply 
well-loved and well-used, a metaphor for 
the things that we appreciate and cherish. 
Everything that is material, everything 
that we can feel will decay at some point. 
We can dread that moment, we can try 
and hide from it, but our possessions will 
expire, turn lumpy, uneven, and maybe 
even a sickly green color. What was once 
an integral part of our home is now tucked 
away in a corner, in the attic, or maybe in 
storage, but to see this lounger stunningly 
placed in the middle of the room, 
unabashedly and unashamedly, reminds us 
that we should not be afraid of our things 
as they decay. Decay deserves to be the 
centerpiece. Decay is beautiful.

layout by Tracy Le | Visual EditorA Day to Remember
started off with one of their classic tracks, 
“The Downfall of Us All.” They kept the 
audience on their toes with older releases 
from their albums Homesick and Common 
Courtesy while also including new tracks. 
“Rescue Me” is a recent collaboration with 
Marshmello — which I had initially been 
unsure about — but the fusion of rock and 
EDM somehow works. “Degenerates” is 
the band’s most recent release from their 
upcoming album You’re Welcome which 
comes out in just under two weeks. The track 
is definitely more on the pop-punk side, but 
I’m eager to see what direction the band 
takes with their sixth album.
The band finished off the show with an 
encore of three songs. Before they showed 
up on stage again, I was left sort of empty. 
How could the band not perform “If It 
Means a Lot to You,” perhaps one of the 
most iconic emo songs? The second that 
lead singer Jeremy McKinnon swapped 
his electric guitar for an acoustic guitar 
and called for the audience to turn on the 
flashlights on their phones, I knew exactly 
where the show was heading.
Much like I did when I was in junior high 
after a rough breakup, I was screaming 
along to the anthem of my adolescent 
heartbreak. “All Signs Point to Lauderdale” 
was next on the encore list. If I had to 
summarize angsty pop-punk adolescence 
in a song, this would be it. Even though 
everyone was exhausted by the encore, the 
energy didn’t die out. The mosh pits kept 
forming and I kept finding myself flying 
around like a ball in a pinball machine. But 
hey, I’m not complaining: it was A Day to 
Remember.
If you told the teenage version of me that I 
would see A Day to Remember, I would’ve 
called you a liar. Yet, I got to see them 
from the pit. I even got in my first mosh pit. 
Maybe next time I’ll be adventurous enough 
to crowdsurf.
It appears that everyone who went through 
a middle school emo phase in the early 
2010s, and repressed it, has since come 
out of the shadows. Maybe I’m projecting. 
Maybe I’m just bitter at not being allowed 
to exclusively wear band merchandise and 
clothes from Hot Topic. Regardless, A Day 
to Remember is one of the first bands that 
encapsulates my coming-of-age.
A band named Can’t Swim was the first 
of many bands to open for A Day to 
Remember. I only got to catch the last song 
of their set, “Stranger.” I had never heard of 
them prior to the show, but I’m not opposed 
to listening to more of their songs or keeping 
my eye out for new releases. The band was 
enjoyable, but I didn’t find it too special. 
The screaming to vocals ratio was a bit 
higher than I would like, but maybe I’m just 
jaded. Maybe I only cling onto OG bands 
like A Day to Remember because of their 
sentimental value. Regardless, I’m happy to 
add “Stranger” to my “Songs I’ve Heard 
Live” playlist.
Beartooth came next. Although I had heard 
much praise for them over the summer, 
I pushed off listening to them until the 
concert. Even my concert-going accomplice’s 
enthusiasm wasn’t enough to sway me. I’m 
now kicking myself for being stubborn and 
for not giving them a listen earlier. They 
struck a nice balance between vocals and 
screaming and had the audience jamming 
and moshing.
I Prevail was another band that I heard so 
much about, but had never listened to. They 
are on the track to prevail my upcoming 
“Favorite November Tracks” playlist. Their 
style was closer to that of Beartooth than of 
Can’t Swim, which I don’t oppose at all. The 
energy was high in the first two sets, but it 
seemed to intensify for this third set.
A Day to Remember truly did live up to 
their name through their performance. They

Given how late in the month the viral 
sinkhole incident occurred, I’m surprised 
it snuck its way twice in this month’s 
meme roundup. Nevertheless, I am not 
unamused, and join hundreds of yinz who

“MAKIN’ MY WAY 
DOWNTOWN”

I, like many other people who commented 
under this meme, have one question: how 
does this make no sense at all yet make so 
much sense? Much like this franchise, the mac

flavor, but alas it is one of the few hot grab-
and-go options for vegetarians at ABP.

Once again, we are faced with yet 
another sinkhole bus meme. Martinez 
photoshopped the meme and Borst 
publicized it, making the “’You dream it, 
We meme it collaboration™” one of the 
most ambitious crossovers since Infinity 
War. I suppose anything with an upwards 
slope can now be connected to Walking 
to the Sky or the sinkhole bus (does it 
have a name? At this point, it should).

“ART OF THE BUS”
Kate Borst and Amalia Martinez
The caption on this meme was “When you ‘good question’ your own Piazza 
question.” I didn’t know that this was a thing until I saw this meme and how 
it racked up over 500 likes this month. Still, I can understand the appeal and 
validation from doing so. You do you.

“PIAZZA PRAISE”

The meme is more seasonal, 
but it still carries a universal 
theme that students can relate 
to year-round. Although I 
cannot speak for the grad 
student experience, I can 
concur that I sometimes (okay, 
often) feel like the lifeless husk 
of the college student that I 
aspire to be.

---------------------------------------------------

This past week, the touring 
production of the musical adaptation 
of Mean Girls made its appearance 
in Pittsburgh at the Benedum Center. 
With its catchy numbers, innovative 
choreography, and creative scenic 
design, it was a truly remarkable 
experience.
The backdrop for Mean Girls was 
an arrangement of large digital 
screens, with entrances cleverly 
hidden by projections shown on 
the screens or movable pieces. 
Although the projected images could 
sometimes feel a little minimalist, it 
drew focus to the actors on stage 
and conveyed the mood to the 
audience appropriately, sometimes 
even providing comic relief, such as 
during Karen’s (Jonalyn Saxer) song, 
“Sexy.”

layout by Tracy Le | Visual Editor
This relatively minimalist design 
extended to the set pieces and most 
of the props as well. However, it 
seemed that the simplicity of the 
set, which included (but was most 
certainly not limited to) several tables 
and school desks on wheels, helped 
transitions feel a bit more fluid. This 
fluidity and simplicity really helped 
the storytelling.
Perhaps the most inventive part of the 
musical was the use of lunch trays 
during “Where Do You Belong?” 
when Damian (Samuel Gerber at 
the Tuesday performance in the 
place of Eric Huffman) shows Cady 
(Wade) around the cafeteria. With 
the bright red trays contrasting with 
the cooler colors of the background, 
tables, and costumes, there was just 
enough flair to really accentuate the 
Mean Girls show review
scene. Additionally, the ensemble’s 
utilization of the lunch trays for 
percussive purposes was uniquely 
clever.
“Stop,” the tap number at the 
top of the second act, was a 
refreshing change of pace. The 
number’s choreography clearly 
differentiated it from others, creating 
a slight disjointedness that perfectly 
accompanies the time skip and brief 
change in narrative perspective — 
doubtlessly one of the highlights of 
the show.
The Mean Girls tour sported a strong 
cast, featuring stellar vocals from 
Danielle Wade, powerful belting 
from Mary Kate Morrissey, and 
splendid riffs from Mariah Rose 
Faith. Outstanding dance numbers 
14

---------------------------------------------------

performed by dance captain 
Ixchel Cuellar, Marcus Shane, 
Sky Flaherty, and the incredible 
swings and ensemble members 
enhanced the vivid animation of the 
play as a whole.
Mean Girls builds upon the movie’s 
satirical elements and brings in some 
of the film’s iconic lines, but changes 
certain narrative elements to shed 
light on a variety of contemporary 
social issues. While these differences 
are slight in the grand scheme of 
things, the impact on the overarching 
message is considerable.
Instead of solely satirizing vicious 
high school dynamics, the musical 
also builds on the ideas introduced 
in Ms. Norbury’s “girl-on-girl crime” 
speech from the film. These details 
range 
from 
small quips 
about the 
double-standards 
in traditional gender 
roles and objectification, to 
entire musical numbers encouraging 
female self-advocacy — most notably, 
Janis’s (Morrissey) “I’d Rather Be 
Me.” These additions result in the 
transformation of a classic teen 
comedy into a feminist work of 
art while retaining the elements of 
satirical absurdity.
The message of strength 
despite marginalization 
echoes through in the 
finale. The final notes of “I 
See Stars” not only see a 
reconciliation between Cady 
(Wade) and everyone her 
choices have hurt, but also a 
resounding message peers to 
support one another, stepping 
back to take in the collective 
beauty and brilliance of good-
spirited individualism.
Flashy, bold, and “Fearless,” Mean 
Girls is a fun show that balances the 
lightheartedness of satirical comedy 
with the seriousness of the pressing 
social issues it addresses — definitely 
a show worth watching.
