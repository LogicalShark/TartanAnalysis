Students registered 
to vote in Pennsylvania 
cast their ballots this 
past Tuesday in the Con-
nan room for local and 
statewide of?ces, as well 
as two Pennsylvania bal-
lot measures. Though lo-
cal Democrats fared well, 
Republicans made gains in 
some statewide races.
One such gain was 
the victory of Republi-
can Sallie Mundy, interim 
Supreme Court Justice to 
the Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court, over Democrat and 
former Steeler Dwayne 
Woodruff in the highest 
statewide seat up for elec-
tion following an email porn 
scandal that led to the resig-
nation of two Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court Justices. 
Justice Mundy marketed 
both her bipartisan respect, 
as she had been appointed 
interim justice by Demo-
cratic Governor Tom Wolf, 
and funded late-launching 
attack ads against her op-
ponent, whom she had 
decisively out-fundraised.
Though Justice Mundy’s 
margin of victory was under 
?ve percent, it represented 
the widest margin in this 
year’s statewide judicial 
elections in what might 
portend an increasingly 
purple state. She was be-
hind, however, by 27 per-
centage points in Allegheny 
County. Democrats retain 
control of the Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court, which re-
cently decided to fast-track 
a political gerrymandering 
case, and which continu-
ously makes decisions that 
impact the lives of people all 
over Pennsylvania.
Pittsburgh maintained 
its status as a deeply blue 
city, with Mayor Bill Peduto 
running unopposed and 
easily securing re-election. 
Peduto recently garnered 
national attention in his 
response to President 
Trump’s claim that his ad-
ministration was working 
for “Pittsburgh, not Paris.” 
He spent a year studying at 
Carnegie Mellon University 
and worked with the uni-
versity in 2016 to launch 
Pittsburgh’s Smart City 
Application. Sheriff Bill 
Mullen, a Democrat, was 
also re-elected.
Democrats also experi-
enced some unanticipated 
gains in races such as the 
Allegheny County Council, 
with Democrat Anita Prizio 
beating out Republican 
incumbent Ed Kress. In the 
three other County Council 
races where candidates 
were running unopposed, 
all of the incumbents held 
onto their seats, with both 
Democrats beating their op-
ponents by a margin of over 
ten points, and Republican 
Tom Baker, who represents 
County Council district one, 
winning by less than one 
point.
Both referenda on the 
ballot were approved as 
well, with voters over-
whelmingly choosing to 
amend Pittsburgh’s home-
rule charter to allow city 
employees to take side jobs 
at schools. The statewide 
amendment to Pennsyl-
vania’s constitution that 
would allow legislatures to 
vote to allow taxing enti-
ties to exempt primary resi-
dents from property taxes 
was also passed. Allegheny 
County voted against it by a 
slim margin.
Though local elections 
proved  to trend largely 
Democratic, results such 
as the election of Justice 
Mundy showed that state-
wide races can prove highly 
competitive.
Voter turnout was 
around 23 percent, down 
from 2015 where around 26 
percent of registered voters 
cast ballots in the last non-
presidential or midterm 
election year. Allegheny 
County also did not of?cially 
hand out “I voted” stickers, 
instead opting to give voters 
receipts that state the date 
and their voter number, and 
are much less fun.

the elections can be found

Michael Trick, the Harry B. and James H. Higgins Professor of 
Operations Research, was officially welcomed as the new dean 
for Carnegie Mellon University’s Qatar campus. Trick, the third 
dean of Carnegie Mellon Qatar since it opened in 2004, will 
succeed Ilker Baybars, who stepped down at the end of the 2016-
17 academic year after serving the role for the last six years.
Trick has been a member of Carnegie Mellon University’s 
Tepper School of Business since 1989 where he served numerous 
leadership positions including senior associate dean for faculty 
and research. Over the past 25 years, Trick has mentored and 
supported faculty and student researchers, advanced strategic 
initiatives, overseen the promotion and tenure process, and el-
evated the research reputation of our top-ranked business school, 
according to a Tepper press release congratulating Trick on his 
new appointment.
Trick holds a Ph.D. in industrial engineering and has done 
research in the field of operations research, with a specializa-
tion in computational methods in optimization. He has written 
more than 50 professional publications and was the editor of six 
volumes of refereed articles.
“I am honored to be named dean of this remarkable 
institution,” Trick said in a university press release. “University 
is a transformative time for young people, and I look forward to 
building an educational experience at [Carnegie Mellon Qatar] 
that is enriching, enlightening and inspiring.”
Several Carnegie Mellon University faculty members were 
present at the ceremony to celebrate Trick’s new position, 
including Interim President Farnam Jahanian.
“Carnegie Mellon is proud to be a part of this community 
to deliver educational and research programs that will sup-
port and contribute to the long-term development of Qatar’s 
knowledge-based economy,” said Jahanian. “The leader we have 
chosen to build on this success is Michael Trick. Under Dean 
Trick’s leadership, I am confident that [Carnegie Mellon Qatar] 
will continue its development as an integral part of the Qatar 
landscape, representing CMU’s dynamic global capacity.”
Also present was Interim Provost Laurie Weingart who 
applauded Trick’s “long-standing commitment to a nurturing 
research and learning environment.”
“His commitment is driven by excellence and his belief in the 
power of collaboration to motivate and inspire others. These are 
values that will serve him well in this role,” she said.

Professor Dan Akerib discusses his research on dark matter
Paola Mathus/Art Editor
EVANGELINE LIU
Staffwriter
In the twentieth century — and 
even in the late nineteenth cen-
tury — evidence was discovered 
and eventually confirmed that 
the mass data analyzed from the 
visible mass of stars in galaxies 
did not match up with the masses 
that would be implied by the ro-
tation rates of the galaxies. In 
particular, the observed rotation 
rates of galaxies were faster than 
would be possible if the only mass 
in the galaxies came from visible 
matter from stars; if that were 
the case, the galaxies would fly 
apart. Additionally, gravitational 
lensing of galaxy clusters could 
determine their masses and it was 
found that there was a significant 
mass that was unaccounted for by 
the visible matter we can detect. 
Thus, researchers hypothesized 
the existence of “dark matter” — 
a form of unseen, hard-to-detect 
matter that provides the neces-
sary gravity to hold these fast-
rotating galaxies together.
Dan Akerib, a professor of par-
ticle physics and astrophysics at 
Stanford University and research-
er at the SLAC National Accelera-
tor Laboratory (originally named 
the Stanford Linear Accelerator 
Center), was at Carnegie Mellon 
on Oct. 26 to give a lecture on his 
years of researching the nature of 
dark matter, which is still one of 
astrophysics’ greatest unsolved 
mysteries.
In an interview with The 
Tartan, Akerib explained how 
dark matter came to captivate 
him. “I think that the idea that 
most of the matter in the universe 
is something that is different from 
us [is very fascinating]... some-
one described it as the ultimate 
Copernican revolution,” he re-
flected. He added, “not only are 
we not at the center of the uni-
verse, we’re not even made of the 
same stuff.”
Akerib started the lecture with 
a brief historical summary of the 
reasoning behind the dark matter 
hypothesis and noted the work of 
Vera Rubin, who pioneered the 
idea of graphing rotation rates 
versus distance from the cen-
ter of the galaxy, which at outer 
distance ranges deviated signifi-
cantly from the theoretical curve. 
Her work formed the foundation 
of the dark matter hypothesis and 
the basis of today’s research on 
the subject.
Akerib then summarized 
cosmological methods used by 
astronomers and astrophysicists 
to weigh the universe — in par-
ticular, to find the percentage 
composition of visible mass, dark 
matter, and energy in the uni-
verse. He explained that this ratio 
is significant as matter tends to 
attract while energy tends to re-
pel. In particular, the three main 
methods that cosmologists use 
to find the ratios are supernovae 
standard candles, the 3K cosmic 
microwave background, and the 
matter distributions in the early 
and current universe. The results 
yield an energy density of approx-
imately 70 percent.
Currently, one of the leading 
theories on the nature of dark 
matter is the WIMP theory, short 
for “weakly interacting massive 
particles.” They are called “weak-
ly interacting” because they do 
not form stars or interact much 
with normal matter and have 
very small cross sections, and 
“massive” because of the gravi-
tational pull they exert. WIMPs 
are hypothesized to have formed 
in the Big Bang, and because they 
are hypothesized to have small 
cross sections when the universe 
was expanding, it would have 
been probabilistically difficult 
for WIMPs and anti-WIMPs in the 
early universe to find each other 
and annihilate. Akerib described 
WIMPs as “similar to very heavy 
neutrinos.”
The next step of the theory 
is always to find evidence for it, 
but so far detection of WIMPs has 
proved elusive. He explained that 
WIMPs are most likely not peri-
odic table elements and electri-
cally neutral; “ordinary matter is 
virtually invisible to this stuff” — 
as an example of just how little in-
teraction they have with ordinary 
matter. He stated that WIMPs on 
average scatter once in a light-
year of lead. WIMPs are, by defi-
nition, elusive to our eyes and 
instruments.
Luckily for WIMP researchers 
like Akerib, WIMP events occur 
on the order of 10 to the power of 
16 times annually, so Akerib and 
his team have developed a detec-
tor to try and detect some of these 
events. The detector-building 
process faced a slew of technical 
challenges — electronic noise, 
the inability to detect signals 
below a certain range, and the 
natural radioactivity scattered 
throughout the Earth’s crust that 
could interfere with the detec-
tor. Eventually, the detector was 
designed to be a chamber that 
held liquid xenon (to keep the 
radioactivity as low as possible 
in the center of the chamber), 
which would be ionized by the 
kinetic energy of the WIMP par-
ticles, creating an ionization that 
can be detected. The detector was 
housed in a large water pool a few 
meters underground to minimize 
interference from cosmic rays and 
other extraneous signals.
While the initial runs have not 
caught any events, Akerib and 
his team plan to continue their 
research by building a detector 
fifty times larger than the original 
one. Much of their everyday work 
consists of making and testing the 
wire meshes that go in the detec-
tor — which is very sensitive to 
the smallest imperfections — and 
purifying xenon gas samples us-
ing gas charcoal chromatography.
He detailed an anecdote from 
the building process: locals near 
the site of the upcoming detector 
were worried about radiation lev-
els from the xenon, which turned 
out to be roughly equal to 20 ba-
nanas’ worth of radiation. As a 
reference, people get about 100 
bananas’ dosage of radiation dai-
ly. “You can no longer buy banan-
as in the SLAC cafeteria because 
they’re radioactive [and would 
interfere with the sensitive detec-
tor],” he added.
The plan is to run the new 
detector for 1,000 days.
Behavioral economics provides means to understand issues 
SHRUTI MURALI
Assistant News Editor
Behavioral economics 
is being widely used by 
companies, organizations, and 
even governments because of 
how it revolutionizes the way 
we make decisions, changes 
the way organizations operate, 
and in?uences how policies 
are implemented. People with 
knowledge of behavioral eco-
nomics are thus highly sought 
after by companies search-
ing for smartly designed 
behavioral interventions.
At Carnegie Mellon 
University, behavioral econo-
mists use this unique blend 
of economics and psychol-
ogy to solve pressing issues 
from rising health care costs 
and workplace discrimination 
to climate change and “fake 
news.”
“At Carnegie Mellon, we’re 
looking at problems that 
matter to the world and trying 
to understand the issues and 
why they happen, but also how 
to change them,” said Linda 
Babcock, the James M. Walton 
Professor of Economics and 
head of the Department of So-
cial and Decision Sciences in the 
Dietrich College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences.
This innovative branch of 
knowledge began at Carnegie 
Mellon with the late Herbert 
Simon, a Nobel laureate in 
economics, and current faculty 
member George Loewenstein, 
a co-founder of the ?eld.
“One thing that is unusual 
about the research happening 
in our department is that it 
tends to be a really nice mix 
of both basic and applied 
research,” said Loewenstein, 
the Herbert A. Simon Univer-
sity Professor of Economics 
and Psychology, in a university 
press release. “For example, 
we have projects on topics like 
health insurance, take-up of 
government bene?ts and how 
to increase savings. But we 
also have a lot of basic research 
dealing with issues like how 
and why people avoid informa-
tion and topics like curiosity, 
boredom, and discrimination.”
The fusion of econom-
ics and psychology addresses 
how problems can not only 
be solved through cost-effec-
tive methods but also how 
they can be solved with the 
greatest societal impact. Some 
projects which Carnegie 
Mellon University behavioral 
economists have designed 
include simpli?ed health 
insurance plans to save people 
time and money, methods to 
teach women how to negotiate, 
and creating interactive tools 
for teenagers to prevent sexu-
ally transmitted infections and 
reduce unwanted pregnancies.
“Our brand of behavioral 
economics is much more 
mixed — about 50 percent 
economics and 50 percent 
psychology — than any-
where else. And it’s not just 
that we have economists and 
psychologists. The economists 
know a lot of psychology and 
the psychologists know a lot of 
economics,” Babcock said.
Saurabh Bhargava, as-
sistant professor of econom-
ics and social and decision 
sciences, is a prime example of 
behavioral economics at work. 
He partnered with the Inter-
nal Revenue Service to rede-
sign tax credit communication 
strategies that could help near-
ly millions of disadvantaged 
Americans claim billions in 
bene?ts.
“Ultimately this agenda 
suggests that the way we 
structure, frame and even mar-
ket policies really does make a 
difference. That basic insight 
has the potential to radically 
improve outcomes, especially 
those at the greatest social and 
economic risk,” Bhargava said.
Carnegie Mellon University 
is credited as the leading 
institution in behavioral 
economics. It is the only 
academic institution to offer 
an undergraduate degree in 
behavioral economics, policy, 
and organizations and a Ph.D. 
in behavioral economics, 
jointly with the Tepper School 
of Business.
“The explosion of interest 
by government, nonpro?t 
and industry organizations 
to use behavioral science has 
created a demand for trained 
behavioral economists,” Bab-
cock said. “We are excited to 
offer both undergraduate and 
graduate students the opportu-
nities to learn from us and part-
ner on our research projects 
with government agencies, 
companies and nonpro?ts.”

Special to The Tartan
Aside from our academic 
lives, the Carnegie Mellon 
experience is heavily 
impacted by the presence of 
student groups on campus, 
mainly in the form of student 
organizations. From club 
soccer to engineering soci-
eties to eSports to ballroom 
dance, one of the proud 
attributes of the Carnegie 
Mellon community lies in 
the diversity of its student 
organizations. As such, the 
?nancing of these organiza-
tions, providing each with 
the necessary funds to oper-
ate and to thrive, is a topic 
that is vital to maintaining 
the large variety of student 
activities on campus.
To support our student 
organizations, there exist 
numerous funding sourc-
es on campus that allow 
organizations to gather the 
necessary funds to operate, 
to travel to tournaments 
or competitions, to host an 
event at Carnegie Mellon, 
or to engage in an initiative. 
These funding sources 
include the Undergraduate 
Senate, Graduate Student 
Assembly, Department of 
Student Affairs, Joint Fund-
ing Committee (JFC), Stu-
dent Dormitory Council, 
and the Student Body Vice 
President for Organizations. 
Each source maintains its 
own funding philosophy 
and prefers to fund 
initiatives and organizations 
with respect to its own 
rules. In this student gov-
ernment column, I would 
like to brie?y address and 
to inform the student body 
regarding one of the most 
popular mid-year funding 
sources: special allocations 
from the Undergraduate 
Senate.
The Undergraduate 
Senate receives its budget 
from a portion of the stu-
dent activities fee, a cost 
that every student pays as 
a part of their enrollment. 
Since the Senate allocates 
funds using the student ac-
tivities fee, our funding phi-
losophy primarily focuses 
on the accessibility of the 
proposed event, initiative, 
or organization. In other 
words, the Senate prefers 
to fund proposals that are 
accessible to every under-
graduate regardless of their 
academic standing, grade, 
ethnicity, gender, sexual 
orientation, and religious or 
political beliefs.
Furthermore, we also 
consider the undergraduate 
bene?t of the proposal. 
Typically, after carefully 
reviewing each funding 
application, the Undergrad-
uate Finance Committee 
discusses and debates the 
bene?t or impact that such 
proposal will bring to the 
student body. Thus, the Sen-
ate prefers to allocate funds 
to events and initiatives that 
provide bene?ts to large 
portions of the student body.
On top of this, as a mid-
year funding source, the 
Senate is committed to 
funding unexpected costs, 
new organizations and 
initiatives, and organiza-
tions that were not JFC-
funded the previous year. 
In essence, while the JFC 
funds in bulk on an annual 
basis for the upcoming aca-
demic year, the Senate and 
the various other funding 
sources listed above exist 
to help organizations get 
through the year in situa-
tions in which organizations 
face costs that were not 
planned last year in their 
JFC budget.
To apply for special 
allocations funding, log 
on to The Bridge and 
click “Common Funding 
Application” on the bottom 
right corner of the website, 
under “Campus Links.” 
Here, organizations can sub-
mit a common application 
to the various funding 
sources listed above. It is 
inevitable that organiza-
tions encounter unexpected 
costs throughout the year, 
and we are here to help you 
have a successful one. For 
any further questions about 
Senate Finance or special 
allocations, please contact

Egypt’s rape culture shows reach of misogyny
On Egyptian national televi-
sion, accomplished Egyptian law-
yer Nabih al-Wahsh said the un-
thinkable. “I say when a girl walks 
about [in revealing clothing], it is 
a patriotic duty to harass her and 
a national duty to rape her,” he 
asserted. Al-Wahsh’s comments 
are perplexing, disappointing, 
and the sort to spark feelings of 
indignation in any decent person. 
What is more upsetting, however, 
is that they were not made in a 
vacuum; they are a part of a pan-
demic of sexual assault against 
women that has been sweeping 
across Egypt for years.
According to a 2008 survey by 
the Egyptian Center for Women’s 
Rights, 83 percent of Egyptian 
women and 98 percent of foreign 
women who visit Egypt say they 
have been sexually harassed. Oth-
er studies, by the United Nations 
(UN) for example, report other 
?gures as high as 99.3 percent.
Before 2006, sexual assault 
was barely discussed in any 
national manner in Egypt. It 
wasn’t a politically divisive topic. 
Many viewed it as a foreign — 
Western — notion inapplicable 
to Egyptian culture. Then came 
the Eid-al-Fitr holiday in 2006 
where more than 20 female 
demonstrators were sexually 
assaulted by groups of hundreds 
of men arriving in buses as nearby 
police did nothing.
Since 2006, mass sexual as-
sault has become a grim but pub-
licized part of Egyptian public 
life. At religious festivals, political 
protests, and in densely crowded 
urban locations, hundreds of men 
gather around a single woman 
and commit sexual assault. It’s 
called the circle of hell. Victims 
report being groped, stripped, 
penetrated, and raped while men 
in the outer perimeter of the cir-
cle deter rescuers from interven-
ing. The ages of those assaulted 
range from seven to 70.
It is possible that mass sexual 
assault has always been com-
monplace in Egypt, but kept out 
of public and international dis-
course. The fall of the Mubarak 
regime in 2011 may have ?nally 
given women the political free-
dom to speak out publicly.
There’s also evidence that the 
regime change caused an uptick 
in mass sexual violence: 500 cas-
es were reported between June 
2012 and June 2014, 25 times 
more than the previous year’s ?g-
ures. At political rallies and even 
at the inauguration of President 
Fatteh, women could be heard 
screaming.
Egypt’s issue truly entered 
international consciousness 
when acclaimed CBS journalist 
Lara Logan was assaulted in 
2011. That night, while in the 
middle of a large crowd, her 
camera crew’s lights went dead. 
The surrounding crowds of men 
exploited the shroud of darkness 
to rip off Logan’s clothes, injure 
her, and sexually assault her for 
30 minutes. She was ?own back 
to the United States the next day, 
where she spent four days in the 
hospital. The horrifying event 
drew public shock, and even a 
private call from former President 
Barack Obama to Logan.
The consistency of mass sex-
ual assault paints a grim picture 
of the state of gender equality in 
Egypt. These attacks are a tool 
used to shame women and dis-
suade them from participating 
in public life. Moreover, male at-
tackers are protected by systemic 
advantages such as a complacent 
police force and a misogynistic 
society. In fact, one survey found 
that up to 60 percent of higher-
educated Egyptian women blame 
the victims for being attacked, 
attributing the actions of men to 
promiscuous clothing, a hateful 
ideology that al-Wahsh parroted 
on national television. In con-
trast, most survivors of the circle 
of hell reported wearing conser-
vative clothing and no make-up 
when attacked. 
Prejudice against women 
is a part of many cultures the 
world over, including Western 
culture. Pinpointing a root cause 
for Egypt’s mass sexual violence 
has proven especially dif?cult. 
Some, like journalist Shereen El 
Feki, argue that unemployment, 
social media, and a newfound 
lack of family surveillance are to 
blame. Others point to misplaced 
sexual desire, sexual deprivation, 
and a general wish to dominate 
women. The recurring theme, 
nonetheless, is a general 
disregard for women as people.
In response, groups such as 
Operation Anti-Sexual Harass-
ment (OpAntiSH) have sprung 
up to aid Egyptian women. Volun-
teers wear padded clothing, hel-
mets, and gloves as they attempt 
to get women from the center of 
mobs, often forming protective 
physical circles around them. Pro-
tective gear is especially crucial, 
since mobs created ‘tea stands’, 
where they have boiling water 
ready to be doused on rescuers. 
OpAntiSH also provides spare 
clothing, medical treatment, and 
counseling to survivors. 
OpAntiSH’s efforts are virtu-
ous, to say the least. The group 
responded to 15 events in 2013 
alone; nonetheless, on its own, 
cannot be relied on to crack soci-
etal change. After all, 80 Egyptian 
women were once infamously as-
saulted by mobs in a single day — 
more than OpAntiSH can handle. 
The current lack of repercussions, 
both judicial and societal, is what 
encourages men to join in these 
heinous acts publicly. Crowd-
control is a must, as is a police 
force concerned enough to don 
riot gear and disperse malevolent 
mobs as they form. This solution 
doesn’t address the root cause of 
mass sexual violence: misogyny. 
It also requires extensive retrain-
ing of Cairo’s police force, which 
could be costly or ineffective.
The United States is currently 
experiencing a cross-industry 
revelation of systemic sexual as-
sault against women. Egypt’s 
mass sexual assault is simply a 
different side of the same coin. 
The wider issue of misogyny is 
ingrained in Egypt’s culture and 
harder to solve. Sexism can-
not be scared out of men or dis-
persed like mobs, but it can be 
unlearned. Brave Egyptians are 
launching campaigns, such as 
street art projects about sexual 
assault, that force their fellow 
citizens to grapple with societal 
misconceptions about women. 
And therein lies hope for the fu-
ture,  that enough minds will be 
changed and that Egyptians will 
see it as a patriotic duty to protect 
women and a national duty to up-
lift them.
Meritocracy is ideal, blocked by difference
DENIS MERIGOUX
As initiated last week, this col-
umn will start to broaden its topics 
to discuss subjects outside Carnegie 
Mellon. This week, I will attempt to 
give some perspective to the notion 
of meritocracy as it is understood in 
the U.S.
Meritocracy is a cornerstone of the 
American philosophy: through the 
self-made man myth, it conveys a fair 
view of the society where everyone 
will have a chance to climb the social 
ladder, given enough hard work and 
determination. And there exists a 
certain number of illustrations of 
this principle, who happen to be 
widely spread in media: many of the 
CEOs of the major tech companies 
feature extraordinary life paths, 
rising from humble origins to become 
multibillionaires.
Here at Carnegie Mellon, the 
meritocracy is almost ideal: as I’ve 
described in my ?rst article about the 
grading scheme, the most rewarded 
students are those who work the 
most, and not the most naturally in-
telligent ones. If you fail, your heart 
isn’t enough in the work and you 
learn a valuable life lesson: hard work 
is the key to success.
It is, of course, a good idea to fol-
low these principles; however if you 
really believe in meritocracy, you have 
to follow the idea to the end. Indeed, 
if everyone were to be judged on their 
own merits, it is natural that they 
should start at the same point. This 
ground leveling is essential to fair-
ness because it ensures that the game 
is not rigged. But here in the U.S., the 
leveling is unequal and leaves out the 
most important factor of all: wealth.
One of the things that impressed 
me when coming here was all the at-
tention and infrastructure for people 
with disabilities. Almost all of the 
public buildings and public transpor-
tation are designed to welcome all 
people, and that is something Ameri-
cans can be proud of. However, if 
disabled or more generally ill people 
have the physical ability to move free-
ly, they still have to cover their health 
costs out of their pockets. Because of 
this, their purchasing power is sig-
ni?cantly reduced and so are their life 
opportunities. I think it is not fair for 
someone hit by a genetic disease or by 
a disease caused by an external factor 
(think of the lead contamination in 
Flint, Michigan or a gun wound from 
a mass shooting) to have to support 
their health costs by themselves.
I wish we would live in a world 
where everyone has to endure the 
consequences of his own actions and 
only his own. However, randomness 
is an inherent part of life, and, in my 
opinion, a truly meritocratic society 
should at least try to compensate for 
random hazards in order to provide 
equal opportunities. Speaking of 
opportunities, whether or not you 
attend college is a decisive factor in 
your early career. And in the U.S., the 
decision to go to college will often not 
be taken on your high school merit, 
but rather on your parent’s wealth. I 
would not be here in graduate school 
if it weren’t for my grandmother’s 
inheritance.
These two key examples convey a 
simple idea: if you believe in the ideal 
of meritocracy, then you should ?ght 
so that it applies to the whole society 
and not only for yourself, regardless 
of how much merit you can have. The 
Republican party has recently been 
attacking the estate tax, nicknaming 
it the “death tax.” But the estate tax 
is a cornerstone of meritocracy: the 
wealth you receive from your ances-
tors is the most unfair advantage that 
can be given to you because nobody 
chooses where he is born. On the con-
trary, in an ideal meritocracy, the es-
tate tax should be as high as to allow 
the only estate of sentimental values 
such as the family house to be passed 
to the descendant, to ensure that ev-
eryone can build up with his merit 
from the same starting position.
At this point, I could epitomize 
the arrogant French and claim that all 
of this problems don’t exist in France 
and its high-taxes welfare state. How-
ever, it is not the case at all. Actually, 
French sociologists have been study-
ing the question of meritocracy in 
French society, and their ?ndings are 
fascinating. I apologize in advance for 
this very gross summary of Bourdieu’s 
very ?ne analysis, which is a sociology 
standard around the world.
Apart from the economic capital 
which was discussed above, an 
individual accumulates throughout 
his life two other forms of capital: 
the social capital (relationships, 
professional network) and the 
cultural capital (knowledge, artistic 
culture, social status). It turns out 
that inequalities in the cultural 
capital or in the social capital when 
reaching adulthood take a huge toll 
on meritocracy afterward. Indeed, 
the French higher education system 
is mostly free and accessible to 
everyone; nevertheless, extensive 
studies have shown an over-
representation of sons and daughters 
of the wealthiest subset of society in 
its elite schools.
The entrance examination I took 
for my undergraduate in France is 
an attempt at ideal meritocracy: you 
take two weeks of exams, both oral 
and written, and your admission 
to the school is determined only 
by your scores at those exams. 
Although everyone should have 
equal opportunities, the statistics of 
admission show that 60 percent of 
the admitted students had at least 
one parent who is either an executive 
or has an intellectual profession like 
being a professor. Those who had at 
least one parent professor performed 
in general much better at the exam, 
or had more chances to know that the 
exam even existed.
My take on this issue is that meri-
tocracy is above all else an ideal. It is 
essential for a society because every-
one needs to believe there exist some 
fairness and justice in the world they 
live in. But meritocracy should not be 
used to justify indecent inequalities be-
tween individuals: willingness to work 
hard is not the only difference between 
a multi-millionaire and a destitute. 
And as economic growth slows down 
worldwide, randomness and initial ad-
vantages are going to weigh in much 
more in determining one’s future.
This situation is familiar to old 
world countries, and it was often 
war that leveled the ground to en-
sure better meritocracy. After two 
devastating con?icts, most Western 
European countries decided that the 
state should step in to provide safety 
nets for its population. I often wonder 
which solution the U.S. will adapt to 
tackle this recent meritocratic crisis; 
in all cases, I enjoy analyzing this fas-
cinating country that always offers 
perspective to me.

Robert Mueller’s ?ring would be a Constitutional crisis
We need dialogue, not more polarization
TREVOR LAZAR
Junior Staffwriter
In light of the recent indictments 
emerging from Special Counsel 
Robert Mueller’s investigation 
into Russian meddling in the 2016 
election, some Congressional 
Republicans have responded in 
an alarming manner. Rep. Matt 
Gaetz (R-FL), co-sponsored by 
Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) and Louie 
Gohmert (R-TX), called for Mueller 
to be ?red on the grounds that he 
is somehow inextricably linked 
to Hillary Clinton and her 2016 
presidential campaign. Moreover, 
President Donald Trump himself 
expressed anger with Mueller 
and the Russia investigation, as 
apparent in his tweet — presented 
in all caps to emphasize just how 
strongly he feels he’s correct — 
“….Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”
The validity of that statement 
remains to be seen, but Mueller’s 
investigation will almost certainly 
provide an answer sometime in the 
future. In the meantime, we are 
left to grapple with the possibility 
that Mueller could be ?red. How 
exactly that might come about, if 
at all, is dif?cult to say. However, it 
should be rather dif?cult for Trump 
to do it, and for Gaetz, Biggs, and 
Gohmert it is all but impossible.
One key fact here is the recusal 
of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. 
In light of Sessions’ controversy 
over his failure to disclose 
communications with Russian 
of?cials, the Attorney General 
recused himself from the Russia 
investigation to prevent a con?ict of 
interest. What would presumably 
be Trump’s easiest means of ?ring 
Mueller — ordering Sessions to do 
it — is now impossible. In place of 
Sessions, Deputy Attorney General 
Rod Rosenstein is overseeing 
Mueller’s investigation. Also 
important is the ardent support 
Rosenstein has shown for Mueller, 
indicating he would be unlikely to 
?re the Special Counsel if Trump 
asked him to. This makes sense 
given that he appointed Mueller 
himself, but he later af?rmed 
his support when questions of 
Mueller’s potential arose. “Director 
Mueller is going to have the full 
independence he needs to conduct 
that investigation,” Rosenstein 
said.
So, if Trump wants Mueller 
gone, the path to that outcome is 
ethically questionable. Namely, 
Trump could adopt one of Nixon’s 
tactics — ?re the overseer until 
one willing to ?re the investigator 
is appointed. This ultimately got 
Nixon in more trouble, though, 
and any attempt by Trump to do 
this could potentially bring calls 
for impeachment. If Sen. Lindsey 
Graham (R-SC) is to be believed, 
there “[would] be holy hell to pay” 
if Trump were to remove Mueller.
This whole situation seems to 
be thematically consistent with the 
rest of Trump’s presidential tenure. 
There is a ?avor of procedural un-
certainty and an undertone of au-
tocracy. We are left then to wonder 
what might come of the remainder 
of the Trump presidency. With im-
peachment still seeming unlikely, 
and with anti-Trump Republican 
incumbents announcing retire-
ment in mass, Mueller might be the 
only real threat to the Trump presi-
dency beyond record-low approval 
ratings and a Democratic challeng-
er in 2020. With Paul Manafort 
and company recently indicted 
on numerous charges, Mueller is 
closing in on the President. The in-
formation from these indictments 
shows that Trump campaign of?-
cials were at the very least trying 
to collude with Russia, though it is 
a distinct possibility that they were 
too incompetent to succeed in this 
effort.
Given how high up these indict-
ments are reaching — Manafort 
was at one point Trump’s cam-
paign manager — we know that 
Trump feels threatened. And we 
expect him to do what he usu-
ally does when he doesn’t like the 
facts: lie. He will lie and lie and 
try to justify ?ring Mueller, and if 
he can make it past the procedural 
roadblocks and ?re Mueller, all 
bets are off. Conversations of im-
peachment previously limited to 
Democrats in Congress will reach 
the rest of Washington. Moreover, 
given the Democrats’ recent gains 
in the 2017 election, it might be in 
the GOP’s best interest to ?nally 
stand up to Trump.
Emphasize individuals, not politics
MADELINE KIM
Hyperpartisanship continues 
to be a trend in American politics. 
Political discussion among people 
of opposite ends of the political 
spectrum usually leads to both 
sides “triggering” the other, or at 
the very least, spewing insults such 
as “snow?ake” or “deplorable.” Of 
course, politics has never been a 
smooth-sailing conversation topic. 
The saying “never discuss politics 
in polite company” often holds 
true in most social situations and 
has held true for longer than the 
current hostile political climate 
has. However, there is one disturb-
ing trend that appears to be preva-
lent more than ever that both sides 
are guilty of: using tragedies to 
back a political agenda.
Many people claim that 
Republicans, collectively, jump 
at any terrorist attack to push 
for extreme vetting. President 
Donald Trump called for extreme 
vetting in response to the New 
York terrorist attack. He called for 
H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law, and used 
the death of Kathryn Stenile to “ 
revise provisions relating to the 
reentry of removed aliens”. Since 
then, Jim Steinle, father of Kate 
Steinle, has demanded that his 
daughter’s name is taken out of the 
law and expressed that he ?nds the 
usage of his daughter’s death to be 
revolting and not “honor[ing] her 
memory.”
Democrats are guilty of 
politicizing tragedies as well. 
When there’s a mass shooting, 
left-leaning reporters have been 
seen showing little to no respect 
for the victims or the incident. 
The infamous Hayley Geftman-
Gold, former vice president and 
senior legal counsel at CBS in New 
York, stated that the victims of the 
Vegas shooting were “Republican 
gun-toters” who deserved “no 
sympathy.” Additionally, the 
left has been criticized for being 
“disrespectful to the dead” by 
using mass shootings as evidence 
for the need for stronger gun laws.
Now, I would like to make 
clear that there is a distinction 
between creating pragmatic solu-
tions in light of tragic events and 
politicizing tragedies. One calls for 
dialogue to evaluate the causes of 
the problem at hand and prevent 
them in the future. The other cre-
ates demonization, leading to both 
sides becoming even more polar-
ized and unwilling to listen. This 
line, although important, is often 
blurred.
The goal of having a demo-
cratic republic, as is the case in the 
U.S., is to have both ends of the 
political spectrum covered so that 
one party does not rule the entire 
country and turn it into a single-
party state. By combining aspects 
of a republic and a democracy, we 
strive to create a sovereign state 
where the people can vote for rep-
resentatives who can represent 
a common vision. A system that 
should allow both sides to hold 
the other accountable and create 
a balanced society is now a society 
where dialogue is getting harder 
and clouded by emotion.
So where do we go from here? 
The solution is convoluted. Both 
sides’ optimal strategy appears 
to be to remain defensive in 
order to protect themselves from 
each other. If one party appears 
to be viciously attacking the 
fundamentals of another, the best 
strategy appears to be to ?ght back 
with an equally vicious defense. 
Left-leaning media outlets criticize 
the Republican party; the right, 
in response, cries out “fake 
news!” Conversely, the current 
Republican-majority house takes 
over the nation; consequently, the 
left gets defensive and demands 
that Trump leaves of?ce. Not 
?ghting back makes one feel 
vulnerable, but further adding to 
the divisive climate only repels us 
further away.
One step that we can take is to 
separate the events from our emo-
tions. Sensationalism appeals to 
strong emotions such as outrage, 
and it is easy to fall into that trap. 
Currently, outlets have been act-
ing more like gossip sites than 
accredited sources for the latest 
news. The days leading up to the 
U.S. 2016 presidential election, 
left-leaning media entertained 
Trump by putting great emphasis 
on his outlandish behavior and 
outrageous tweets. Conversely, 
right-leaning media constantly re-
minded the nation about Clinton’s 
e-mail scandal and the controver-
sy surrounding her husband. By 
putting gossip over actual truth-
telling, we have grown to resent 
each other even more. Instead of 
holding debates on handling gun 
violence and immigration policy, 
we combined the person with the 
person’s respective political be-
liefs. We con?ated a person’s po-
litical af?liation to the value of the 
person as a whole: Republicans are 
gun-obsessed racists, Democrats 
are whining “snow?akes.”
Putting less emphasis on pathos 
and shifting it towards logos is 
easier said than done. When there 
is diversity in thought, con?ict is 
inevitable, thus making a society 
in which the people can all agree 
on a common vision is near impos-
sible, if not completely. However, 
the hostile political climate is not 
sustainable. A nation that has such 
division between parties cannot 
hold productive discussions that 
will lead to solutions. By calling 
each other names and dismissing 
the news that contradicts our para-
digm as “fake news,” we are stray-
ing further from the possibility of 
reaching compromise.

Imagine a utopia free of guns 
or weapons of any type where 
mass shootings ceased to exist. As 
a personal believer in the Second 
Amendment, I can still see why 
the promise of such a world may 
be a tempting reason to ban ma-
chines capable of murder. Howev-
er, the heroin epidemic currently 
facing this nation shows just how 
effective no-tolerance banning 
is to solving problems. Like the 
heroin epidemic, America’s mass 
shooting problems do not lie 
in any physical item; they lie in 
something much deeper. A lack of 
initiative by our nation to treat the 
mentally ill and media glamoriza-
tion of killings have led to individ-
uals becoming disturbed and even 
encouraged by society to carry out 
the most horrible deeds.
Like the unfortunately count-
less number of shootings that 
preceded it, the Texas church 
mass shooting has exempli?ed 
America’s sad handling of mental 
illnesses. Like almost any mass 
shooter, the Texas church shooter 
was not some random citizen that 
woke up one day and decided to 
be a psycho killer; there were 
red ?ags everywhere. According 
to CNN, this is a man that “had 
served a year in military jail for 
beating and choking his wife, 
threatening her with a ?rearm, 
and fracturing her child’s skull.” 
In 2012, he even escaped a health 
facility “where he was being treat-
ed for ‘mental disorders.’”
While more in-depth back-
ground checks could arguably 
have bene?ts, America’s primary 
issue is not its handling of ?re-
arms; it is the handling of the 
mentally ill people who receive 
these ?rearms. According to the 
Huf?ngton Post, in a year, one 
in four adults have a mental ill-
ness. Despite this, discussions of 
mental health are often rare and 
on the verge of taboo. When seri-
ous red ?ags in someone’s mental 
health do appear, health treat-
ment centers are often substituted 
with prison bars. According to 
the American Psychological As-
sociation, “about 10 percent to 
25 percent of U.S. prisoners suf-
fer from serious mental illnesses, 
such as major affective disorders 
or schizophrenia.” We continue to 
place these people in overcrowded 
prisons and solitary con?nement, 
both of which have been found to 
have potentially detrimental ef-
fects on their mental health.
Norway’s actions are an 
example of the steps that America 
could be taking to reduce gun 
violence and mass shootings. 
With an incarceration rate that 
is nearly one tenth of that of 
the U.S. according to Business 
Insider, Norway’s prison system 
places a focus on rehabilitation of 
prisoners over punishment. While 
America’s focus is on whether 
or not conditions are horrible 
enough to make inhabitants “pay” 
for their crime, Norway’s prisons 
focus on what Business Insider 
describes as “normalcy” with bar-
less windows, kitchens, vocational 
classes, and an overall focus on 
recovery. The result is astounding. 
While 76.6 percent of prisoners 
are re-arrested within ?ve years of 
people released in the U.S., only 
20 percent of those in Norway 
?nd their way back into the prison 
system within this span.
As a country that embraces 
hunting and sport, Norway is a 
nation that exempli?es the fact 
that it is possible to allow citizens 
to own ?rearms while being a safe 
nation. While the murder rate in 
the United States is a somewhat 
high 4.88 per 100,000, it is only 
0.56 per 100,000 in Norway, ac-
cording to the United Nations Of-
?ce on Drugs and Crime.
This leads to the question of 
what would have happened if 
the Texas church shooter would 
have been placed in a Norwegian 
prison for a year instead of be-
hind American bars. The red ?ags 
were there. If a focus was placed 
on rehabilitating him rather than 
putting him through a year of the 
American prison system, only to 
be freed onto the streets more 
mentally unstable than 
when he went in, per-
haps there would be 
26 more people 
alive today.
Now, imag-
ine this per-
son, whom 
America failed 
to treat, is sit-
ting at home 
watching TV. 
The evening 
news is shown, 
and the large 
face of another 
mass shooter is 
displayed at center. 
According to several 
studies, this is a common 
cause of copycat incidents 
and has given mentally un-
stable individuals the role 
models and storylines that 
help motivate their horrif-
ic actions. Dr. Park Dietz, 
one of America’s leading 
psychiatrists, found that 
“saturation-level news 
coverage of mass murder 
causes, on average, one 
more mass murder in the 
next two weeks.” Accord-
ing to a study by the 
journal PLOS ONE, 20 
to 30 percent of 
mass murders 
are a result of 
such cover-
age.
In order 
to stop such 
retaliation, 
the American 
Psychological Associa-
tion suggested that news media 
should not “show the killer’s face,” 
“incessantly repeat his name,” or 
“repeat any of his manifestos or 
grievances.” Instead, they should 
be focusing on the stories of vic-
tims and humanizing them. For-
tunately, a large portion of the 
attention from the Texas church 
shooting has shifted to the hero 
who ended the killing spree, but 
a much more than necessary cov-
erage was placed on the life and 
motives of the individual behind 
the killings.
In summary, the solution to 
ending America’s mass shooting 
problems is not banning guns 
or cracking down on the rights 
of individuals. The ?rst steps 
to ending these tragedies are 
to take initiatives as a nation to 
battle mental illnesses. Replace 
punishment with rehabilitation 
for all but the most extreme cases. 
Place more emphasis on treating 
mental illnesses and remove 
taboos associated with them 
from society. Remove all possible 
mass shooter motivators from 
news coverage that can result in 
mentally unstable individuals 
retaliating. Place an emphasis on 
people, not politics.

Certain species of water 
striders grow fans on their 
legs, allowing them to navi-
gate habitats that other wa-
ter striders cannot.
You may have seen water 
striders skating around on 
a calm pond or lake, mak-
ing tiny ripples in the wa-
ter’s surface. Water striders, 
also known as pond skaters 
or Jesus bugs, are semi-
aquatic insects whose long 
legs allow them to distrib-
ute their body weight wide 
enough to balance on top 
of water without breaking 
the surface tension. Their 
legs are covered with micro-
scopic hairs, which prevent 
them from getting wet and 
therefore weighed down, 
and trap tiny air bubbles un-
der their feet, allowing them 
to actively repel the water 
beneath.
In addition to the hairs, 
some water striders grow 
feathery fans on the middle 
pair of their six legs. There 
are over 2,000 kinds of wa-
ter striders, but only one ge-
nus — Rhagovelia — grows 
the ?uffy fans. Unlike the 
hairs, the function of these 
fans is a mystery. This mys-
tery captivated biologist 
Abderrahman Khila, who 
?lled his lab with aquariums 
containing dozens of differ-
ent water strider species in 
order to study them.
Khila, who researches 
at the University of Lyon in 
France, ?rst speculated that 
the leg fans might give extra 
support to the hairy legs on 
Rhagovelia, allowing them 
to grow bigger while main-
taining their ability to stay 
on top of the water. How-
ever, Rhagovelia are smaller 
than some other types of 
water strider that lack the 
leg fans. (Water striders in 
Southeast Asia can have leg-
spans the diameter of CDs.)
The fans also didn’t ap-
pear to give Rhagovelia an 
edge in their ?ercely com-
petitive lives. Water strid-
ers often engage in violent 
feeding frenzies and exhibit 
cannibalistic tendencies. “In 
the lab, they eat each other 
all the time,” Khila explains. 
Most cannibalized water 
striders are attacked just af-
ter molting, when they are 
no longer shielded by a pro-
tective exoskeleton.
To solve the mystery of 
the fans, Khila examined 
the other trait that sets Rha-
govelia apart from other 
water striders: their ability 
to make quick changes in 
direction and stay atop the 
water’s surface even when 
the water is fast-?owing. 
In some Rhagovelia speci-
mens, Khila and his col-
leagues suppressed the 
genes that caused the fans 
to grow; for others, they re-
moved parts of the fans. 
The mutated Rhagovelia 
were no better at making 
quick turns and navigat-
ing fast currents than other 
species of water strider that 
naturally lack the leg fans.
Khila considers the 
leg fan trait “one of those 
examples of key evolution-
ary innovations” that “just 
pop up” and turn out to be 
highly bene?cial to a spe-
cies. The emergence of this 
trait allowed Rhagovelia to 
literally explore new terri-
tory: to move from ponds 
and lakes to fast-?owing 
streams.
The results of the water 
strider experiments were 
published last month in 
Science.

Leafhoppers hide eggs with light-absorbing microparticles
EMMA FLICKINGER
Assistant SciTech Editor
Leafhopper bugs camou-
?age their eggs by covering 
them with microparticles 
that de?ect light, research-
ers announced this month.
Leafhoppers (scienti?cal-
ly, Cicadellidae) are small, 
bendy-kneed insects whose 
diet of plant sap makes them 
common garden pests. There 
are about 22,000 known spe-
cies of leafhopper, and most 
of them produce particles 
called brochosomes — tiny 
spheres a few micrometers 
in diameter, with indenta-
tions all over them like the 
dimples on a golf ball. 
The brochosomes are se-
creted in a substance that 
the insects rub on their skin 
to make themselves water-
proof. Leafhoppers also rub 
the substance on their eggs 
— and until recently, no one 
knew why.
When engineering re-
searchers at Penn State 
University made some bro-
chosomes in the lab using a 
novel nanomanufacturing 
process, they discovered 
that the shape and structure 
of the brochosomes prevent 
light from being re?ected in 
any direction. The light that 
hits the brochosomes is com-
pletely absorbed. Because 
of the indentations on the 
brochosomes, the angle the 
light is coming from makes 
no difference. 
This effect helps leaf-
hoppers hide their eggs 
from predators — the light-
absorbing properties of the 
brochosomes make the eggs 
look just like the leaf they’re 
sitting on. The Penn State 
w con?rmed this in two 
ways: ?rst by analyzing the 
geometric properties of the 
brochosomes, and then by 
looking at brochosomes and 
various leaf species

“In order to do good 
economics, you have to 
keep in mind that peo-
ple are human,” said 
Richard Thaler, the win-
ner of this year’s Nobel 
Memorial Prize in Eco-
nomic Sciences according 
to an article in The New 
York Times. That sentence 
quite succinctly describes 
what lies at the heart of 
behavioral economics.
Behavioral economics 
is the interdisciplinary 
study of the effect of peo-
ple’s emotional and psy-
chological state on eco-
nomic activity. People’s 
responses to events, stim-
uli, and other in?uential 
factors is one of the hard-
est things to understand 
and rationally predict but 
it often has the largest im-
pact on economic activity. 
Not everyone always acts 
purely rationally and in 
their own best interests. 
This is where behavioral 
economics comes in and 
tries to ?nd the ways in 
which people are “pre-
dictably irrational” and 
understanding the con-
?icts that arise between 
human beings and ratio-
nality.
Behavioral economics 
at Carnegie Mellon was 
co-founded by Herbert 
Simon, winner of the 1978 
Nobel Memorial Prize in 
Economics and current 
faculty member George 
Loewenstein, a Herbert 
A. Simon University Pro-
fessor of Economics and 
Psychology at Carnegie 
Mellon University and 
co-director of the Center 
for Behavioral Decision 
Research at CMU. He has 
also founded the ?eld of 
neuroeconomics.
Although, the ?eld of 
behavioral economics is 
relatively new, it promises 
a lot in terms of the large-
scale impact it can have. 
Behavioral economists at 
Dietrich College of Hu-
manities and Social Sci-
ences at Carnegie Mellon, 
are doing cutting-edge re-
search — understanding 
and solving some of the 
most dif?cult and most 
complex problems such 
as rising healthcare costs, 
workplace discrimination, 
information interpreta-
tion biases etc. “At Carne-
gie Mellon, we’re looking 
at problems that matter 
to the world and trying 
to understand the issues 
and why they happen, but 
also how to change them,” 
said Linda Babcock, the 
James M. Walton Profes-
sor of Economics. She is 
also the head of the De-
partment of Social and 
Decision Sciences in the 
Dietrich College of Hu-
manities and Social Sci-
ences at Carnegie Mellon. 
She further explains in a 
CMU press release that, 
“our brand of behavioral 
economics is much more 
mixed — about 50 per-
cent economics and 50 
percent psychology — 
than anywhere else. And 
it’s not just that we have 
economists and psycholo-
gists. The economists 
know a lot of psychol-
ogy and the psychologists 
know a lot of economics,” 
Furthermore, the depart-
ment also deploys a Re-
search truck, as shown 
in the aabove photo, that 
allows researchers to col-
lect data that is represen-
tative of a population, by 
moving around different 
locations.
CMU Researchers 
Saurabh Bhargava and 
Loewenstein have im-
proved healthcare plans 
to be more easy-to-un-
derstand, cut costs and 
poor decision-making. 
The bestselling book, 
Women Don’t Ask: The 
High Cost of Avoiding 
Negotiation and Positive 
Strategies for Change, co-
authored by Babcock and 
Sara Laschever, a found-
ing member of the Heinz 
College Negotiation Acad-
emy for Women, explains 
negotiation techniques 
to combat workplace 
discrimination. Another 
project, called Seventeen 
Days, promotes aware-
ness about sexual health 
and teenage pregnancy, 
as opposed to abstinence-
based sex-ed, and helps 
reduce the risk of venere-
al disease and unwanted 
pregnancies. This is in-
deed, work that matters.

IBM announces testing phase of 50 qubit computer
As companies race 
against each other to 
launch the ?rst commer-
cially available quantum 
computer in the market, 
IBM has announced the 
testing phase of a 50 qubit 
computer. This number is 
especially important be-
cause not only in the larg-
est one to be announced, it 
is also the ?rst to actually 
put forward the possibil-
ity for quantum computers 
to be able to perform tasks 
that traditional computers 
cannot. IBM announced 
this prototype testing 
phase on Nov. 10.
Quantum computers 
use a principle called quan-
tum superposition that al-
lows the quantum bits or 
qubits to have states that 
are in-between the tradi-
tional binary of 1 or 0. This 
means that they can per-
form certain tasks better, 
but also means that they 
are more ?nicky and un-
predictable, which makes 
it harder to have a greater 
number of processors.
Google is currently test-
ing a 22 qubit computer, 
and is in the process of de-
signing a larger one. IBM is 
also testing a 17 qubit one 
that it hopes to make com-
mercially available by the 
end of 2017.

U.S. is only country 
to not sign Paris 
Climate Agreement
Syria of?cially signed 
the Paris Climate Change 
Agreement on Nov. 7. This 
comes after Nicaragua’s 
announcement to sign the 
accord in October. The U.S. 
is now the only country to 
not have signed the of?-
cial agreement. Trump an-
nounced in a rose garden 
speech that the deal was 
bad for America’s economy 
and that he would quit the 
deal.
The Paris Climate 
Change Agreement, struck 
in 2015 brings together 
200 countries in a pact to 
reduce their carbon foot-
print and green house gas 
emissions. Speci?cally, the 
agreement’s goal is for its 
members to take steps to 
ensure that this century’s 
average global tempera-
tures rise by no more than 
2 degrees Celsius. It is one 
of the ?rst such agree-
ments of its kind.
Under the of?cial rules 
of the agreement, the US 
can’t withdraw until 2020, 
but then, U.S. of?cials 
haven’t really stated what 
parts of the agreement 
could be renegotiated. 
This means that it would 
be easy for a president 
elected in 2020 to cancel 
the withdrawal.

SpaceX engine explodes during quali?cation test
Earlier this week, one of 
SpaceX’s rocket engines ex-
ploded while quali?cation 
testing in the company’s 
testing facility located in 
McGregor, TX. 
The company con?rmed 
this on Wednesday and is 
currently investigating the 
causes of this unfortunate 
event. This engine was 
intended to be used for a 
2018 testing of a Falcon 9. 
No one was injured during 
this test.
This explosion comes 
after another one of 
SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets 
exploded on a launching 
pad as it was being fueled 
before an engine test ?re 
in September 2016. Anoth-
er explosion occurred in 
2015, when another Falcon 
9 exploded while taking off 
en-route from Cape Canav-
eral to deliver cargo to the 
International Space Sta-
tion. No people were hurt 
in both situations.
This failure comes after 
a very successful year for 
SapceX. They have doubled 
the number of launches 
per year, with 16 successful 
launches this year alone.

These investigations of 
the brochosomes revealed “a 
performance that is compa-
rable to the state-of-the-art 
synthetic antire?ective coat-
ings,” according to the re-
searchers. Highly intrigued, 
they did further experiments 
on their synthetic brocho-
somes and found that the 
least light was re?ected by 
brochosomes with the great-
est amount of indentations 
per surface area. They also 
found the optimal ratio of 
indentation depth to inden-
tation diameter for re?ecting 
as little light as possible. 
These ?ndings will likely 
be used to improve technol-
ogy with components that 
need to absorb as much light 
as possible — for example, 
devices that harvest solar 
energy.

ing in 27th place in 25:51.2. 
Sophomore Josh Kalapos 
and junior Kevin Cory ?n-
ished sixth and seventh 
for the Tartans and 44th 
and 61st overall with times

The Tartans move on to 
the NCAA Division III Cross 
Country Championships, on 
Saturday, Nov. 18, for the 
fourth consecutive season.

FANTASY from A10
Thomas caught eight of 
12 targets for 70 yards re-
sulting in 21 points. Even 
though all but one of his 
players earned double-digit 
points, it still wasn’t enough 
to overcome Yang’s team.
Yes We Cam over Team 
Andah 107.4–48.7
Editor–in–Chief India 
Price more than doubled 
staffwriter Josh Andah’s 
score this week. We get it 
Andah, you care little to 
none about fantasy foot-
ball, but I had hoped that 
by now you would have at 
least changed your name 
to something more fun 
and creative. Andah barely 
had a playable team this 
week with three players 
on bye week, one on in-
jury reserve, and another 
that was benched for a 
hamstring injury. Honestly, 
48.7 points is a lot for him to 
have garnered with so few 
players. He can attribute 
this tiny victory to Seattle 
Seahawks quarterback 
Russell Wilson’s 22 of 32 
completed passes for 212 
yards and two touchdowns 
for 23.6 points and wide re-
ceiver Doug Baldwin caught 
seven of 12 targets for 108 
yards and a touchdown for 
23.8 points. Andah’s lack 
of attention allowed Price 
to pull out a win despite 
scoring in the low 100s. 
Price saw an impressive 
performance from Panthers 
quarterback Cam Newton, 
as usual, completing 13 of 
24 passes for 137 yards, 
nine rushes, and a touch-
down for 20.1. Chiefs wide 
receiver Tyreek Hill also had 
a solid performance with a 
touchdown and two of four 
targets caught for a total of 
15.3 points.
For week ten, I’m up 
against Andah, who has not 
made one adjustment to his 
line since draft day and I’m 
pretty sure has forgotten 
he’s a part of this so it won’t 
be as satisfying, but I should 
at least win since he’ll have 
two players on bye week. 
With many of Yang’s top 
scorers on bye week, I ex-
pect Price to easily over-
come her team. As far as the 
matchup between Tanaya 
and Beresford, it seems a bit 
too close to call right now. 
While I know it’s far too late 
for me to do anything about 
my terrible losing streak, 
I’m looking forward to a vic-
tory in week ten. Although 
maybe I shouldn’t count my 
eggs before they hatch be-
cause the last time I faced 
off against Andah, he still 
won despite having two 
players on bye week. Stay 
tuned.

Football falls to Case Western in Academic Bowl loss
MARIKA YANG
Assistant Sports Editor
On homecoming week-
end, the football team fell 
to the Case Western Reserve 
University Spartans at 
Gesling Stadium in the 32nd 
Annual Academic Bowl on 
Saturday. The 41–34 thriller 
was the second to go into 
overtime in the history of 
the matchup and the ?rst in 
a decade.
The Carnegie Mellon 
offense took the ball for 
the ?rst time after Case 
Western’s opening drive 
ended with a missed ?eld 
goal. Senior quarterback 
Bryan Jangro took his ?rst 
snap of the season for a 
41-yard pass to ?rst-year 
wide receiver Alex Oshita, 
quickly putting the Tartans 
in Spartans territory. Jangro 
hadn’t played in the season 
due to injuries and ended 
senior day with one comple-
tion on one attempt. Junior 
quarterback Alex Cline, 
the Tartans’ usual starter, 
played for the remainder of 
the game.
The Tartans ?nished the 
drive with a 34-yard ?eld 
goal by punter and kicker 
Tyler Kohman, getting on 
the board ?rst, 3–0.
In the next series, the 
Tartans defense limited the 
Spartans to short rushes 
and an incomplete pass to 
force a punt. Cline took the 
ball back for the Tartans 
and led the team down the 
?eld. The 5:45-long drive 
ended at the beginning of 
the second quarter with a 
5-yard touchdown pass from 
Cline to senior wide receiver 
Tommy Mans?eld. The score 
increased the Tartans’ lead 
to 10–0.
The Spartans responded 
on the ensuing drive by 
marching in Tartans terri-
tory and scoring their ?rst 
points of the game, cut-
ting Carnegie Mellon’s lead 
to 10–7. After a Tartans 
three-and-out, the Spartans 
evened the game with a ?eld 
goal on a 50-second drive, 
making the score 10–10. The 
Tartans’ following drive was 
ended by an interception 
by Cline, and the Spartans 
offense took over deep in 
Tartans territory at the 17-
yard line. They took advan-
tage of the turnover on a 
quarterback run for a touch-
down to take the lead 17–10.
The next two drives were 
similar; after another Cline 
interception, the Spartans 
started into Tartans territory 
to score, this time a ?eld 
goal to extend their lead to 
10 points, adding to a total 
of 20 unanswered points. 
Trailing 20–10, the Tartans 
used their three timeouts in 
the ?nal two minutes of the 
half to steadily make their 
way down the ?eld, capping 
off a 10-play, 78-yard drive 
with a second touchdown 
from Cline to Mans?eld and 
cut the lead to three. The 
half ended with the visitors 
leading 20–17.
The Tartans came out 
of halftime hoping to 
play aggressively and put 
more points on the board. 
However, the scoreless third 
quarter was made up of sev-
en total series that ended in 
either a punt of a turnover. 
The Spartans broke through 
the stalemate in the begin-
ning of the fourth quarter 
with a touchdown pass, 
bringing their lead back to 
10, the score now 27–17. The 
Tartans answered to make 
the score 27–24 with a two 
yard rushing touchdown by 
senior running back Sam 
Benger.
With two minutes left 
in the fourth quarter, the 
Tartans led 31–27 after an 
11-yard rush from junior 
running back Rory Hubbard. 
With 22 seconds left, a 
Tartans punt was blocked 
and scooped up by Spartans 
special teams and returned 
for a touchdown. In two 
seconds, the Spartans were 
back in the lead, 34–31. A 
squib kick gave the Tartans 
the ball past mid?eld into 
Spartans territory. Kohman 
made a 43-yard ?eld goal 
with two seconds left in 
regulation to tie the game, 
34–34, sending the game 
into overtime.
The Spartans received 
the ball ?rst in overtime 
and scored a touchdown 
to go ahead 41–34. On the 
Tartan’s drive, Cline threw 
a six yard pass to junior 
halfback Karl-Mark Kumm 
on fourth down to extend 
the game. Facing another 
fourth down, nine yards out 
from the end zone and four 
yards from the ?rst down, 
Benger got the ball but was 
stopped two yards short of 
the ?rst down, ending the 
game. Case Western won 
41–34.
Cline ?nished the game 
25-for-44, a career-high 
331 yards, two touchdowns, 
and three interceptions. 
Mans?eld had a career-high 
131 yards on nine receptions 
and added a touchdown. 
Senior wide receiver had 
88 yards on four catches. 
Benger led the team in rush-
ing with 119 yards on 29 
carries and a touchdown, his 
59th rushing touchdown of 
his Carnegie Mellon career, 
tying the school record.
On defense, senior 
linebacker Kyle Brittain 
made a career-high 19 tack-
les, 10 solo, and recovered 
a fumble. Senior linebacker 
Sean Graff also had a career 
day, with 11 tackles, four 
solo.
The football team ?n-
ished its regular season with 
an overall record of 7–3, 
5–3 in Presidents’ Athletic 
Conference (PAC) play, and 
1–1 in University Athletic 
Association (UAA) play. 
The Tartans will learn on 
Monday, Nov. 13, at noon 
if they will continue their 
2017 season in the Eastern 
College Athletic Conference 
(ECAC) Division III Football 
Fest.
Women’s soccer makes it past ?rst round matchup
Athlete Pro?le: Donohue ful?lled by team and CMU

This weekend, Carnegie 
Mellon is playing host to 
the ?rst and second rounds 
of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association (NCAA) 
Division III women’s soccer 
playoffs. The Tartans, 
ranked number eight, start-
ed off the weekend with a 
game against the unranked 
Farmingdale State Rams. 
A strong showing from 
Carnegie Mellon helped 
propel them to a 1–0 win, 
launching them into the 
second round of the play-
offs.
Carnegie Mellon started 
the game strong, monopo-
lizing possession and get-
ting off multiple shots on 
Farmingdale’s goalie. In 
the 23rd minute junior 
defender Emily Tolmer had 
an impressive header shot, 
but it went just high over 
the crossbar and missed the 
goal. Tolmer’s next shot, 
however, off a corner kick 
from senior Tori Iatarola in 
the 25th minute, de?ect-
ed off the back of a Rams 
defender and directly to the 
feet of senior Haili Adams. 
Adams placed it perfectly 
over the goalie to give the 
Tartans a 1–0 lead. This was 
Adams’ team-leading 11th 
goal of the season.
The Tartans continued 
their heavy offensive push 
throughout the ?rst half, 
but despite accumulating an 
impressive number of shots, 
they were unable to get an-
other goal. Farmingdale 
State’s frustration became 
evident near the end of the 
?rst half, with two Rams 
players receiving yellow 
cards in the 42nd minute.
In the second half, 
Farmingdale State showed a 
bit more energy, and pushed 
more at Carnegie Mellon’s 
defense, testing ?rst-year 
goalkeeper Carolyn Botz 
with four shots on goal, 
with the ?rst shot of the 
game for the Rams coming 
in the 55th minute. In the 
57th minute, Tolmer was 
handed a yellow card as 
well, but the team stayed 
focused. Farmingdale State 
had nine fouls in the second 
half to Carnegie Mellon’s 
seven. However, despite 
strong chances on both 
sides, neither team was able 
to score in the ?nal minutes, 
and Carnegie Mellon ad-
vanced to the second round 
of the playoffs.
The game was full of 
fouls on both sides, with the 
Rams whistled 19 times and 
the Tartans 13. Botz made 
four saves for her twelfth 
shutout of the season and 
?rst of the postseason. 
Farmingdale State goalie 
Daniella Ford made eight 
saves on nine shots.
Thanks to the win, the 
Tartans advanced to the 
next round against the un-
ranked Arcadia College 
Knights on Sunday, Nov. 
12. More details on the 
results of Sunday’s game 
can be found at thetartan.

To senior policy and 
management and social 
and political history double 
major Eliza Donohue, los-
ing has never been an op-
tion — at least not since 
she was in seventh grade. 
At 12 years old, Donohue 
began her competitive vol-
leyball career. Inspired by 
her dad, brother, and sis-
ter, she continued with the 
sport for ten full years, even 
being recruited to Carnegie 
Mellon’s team during high 
school. Donohue pushed 
herself to new limits dur-
ing the time she played for 
Carnegie’s Women’s Varsity 
Volleyball team and made 
the All-University Athletic 
Association (UAA) team this 
past month.
Playing middle blocker, 
Donohue is responsible for 
both blocking the oppos-
ing team’s hits and execut-
ing kills. Her skills in this 
area were noticed by other 
coaches in the UAA, who 
later voted her onto the All-
UAA team. These coaches 
are from various teams 
within the UAA conference 
— not just from Carnegie 
Mellon — which only in-
creases the prestige of being 
elected to the position.
“We have to play every 
team in our conference so 
all the coaches see all the 
players and then they pick 
who they think should be 
recognized on the All-UAA 
team; [this year] the other 
UAA coaches recognized my 
contributions to my team,” 
said Donohue.
Donohue also takes on 
the responsibility of train-
ing younger players to navi-
gate the game and its stress-
es as co-captain. Donohue 
claims the ability to do so 
leads them to keep a more 
positive example; it also al-
lows them to accomplish 
goals they have set for the 
season.
“I watched myself grow 
as a player and a leader 
throughout my time at 
CMU. I watch[ed] my team 
change and grow and it has 
been a really awesome and 
unique experience; this year 
our team was very close and 
united in our goal. Every 
season our goal is to make it 
[to the] NCAAs and to have 
fun doing it... and we made 
it happen,” said Donohue.
The experience Donohue 
has gained from playing on 
Carnegie Mellon’s team has 
been invaluable to her col-
lege experience.
Not only did she grow 
alongside the team through 
her four years, but she also 
experienced cities and 
events she otherwise would 
not have.
“I love the relationships I 
have gained being a part of 
the [CMU Volleyball] fam-
ily. We win and lose togeth-
er and are constantly ready 
to push each other to make 
each other better. I love go-
ing out to dinner after a big 
win and being surrounded 
by my favorite people,” said 
Donohue.
Without her team, 
Donohue would not be the 
same. The family that has 
come from playing volley-
ball and the leadership ex-
perience that has come from 
her position as co-captain 
are invaluable to her.
“The team has shown me 
what it takes to be a leading 
woman. My teammates... 
make me proud to be at an 
institution like CMU [and] 
have shown me how to 
have more con?dence and 
work hard. I believe that 
being a part of this team 
has allowed me to unlock 
my potential at Carnegie 
Mellon; going through the 
challenges of CMU is way 
easier having a team at my 
back,” said Donohue.
Basketball Preview: look for new players to rise up
BRAD PUSKAR
Junior Staffwriter
As the calendar winds 
into the last months of 
2017, the temperature goes 
down, and the excitement 
goes up — because it’s bas-
ketball season, Tartan fans! 
Let’s take a look at some big 
names and some big games 
to watch for this upcoming 
season.
Women’s
Last season’s Tartans 
went an impressive 21–7 
in the 2016-17 season, but 
coming into this season the 
team has suffered big losses 
in the offensive depart-
ment with the graduation 
of seniors Lisa Murphy and 
Jackie Hudepohl. The team 
will be looking to every 
player on the team to ?ll the 
gaps in offense this season.
Look for junior guard 
Jenn Mayberger to be a big 
playmaker this year. Dur-
ing her ?rst year, she set a 
school record for most as-
sists (142), and in 2016-17, 
she led the team again, ?n-
ishing with a more modest, 
but still impressive 97.
Also keep an eye on 
sophomore forward 
Katharine Higgins and 
sophomore guard Makayla 
Filiere to make big shots 
from the three-point line. 
Higgins and Filiere went 
1–2 on three-point baskets 
last season, and will likely 
continue their production 
as sharpshooters from out-
side the white line.
Conference play for the 
Tartans starts Jan. 6, when 
the team takes on Case 
Western Reserve University. 
This should be an interest-
ing test for the team, as 
they split their games with 
Case Western last season. 
Look out for that home 
opener on Jan. 19, when the 
Tartans look to bounce back 
from a 0–2 skid against the 
Chicago Maroons.
Men’s
Last season, the Tartans 
went 14–12. Not their best 
season, to be sure, and, 
similar to the women’s 
team, big veteran losses in 
leading scorers Jack Serbin 
and Chris Shkil aren’t go-
ing to do them any favors. 
Hopefully this year’s con-
siderably younger team can 
pick up the slack. Eyes will 
certainly be on senior guard 
Ryan Maha, who was third 
in points-per-game last 
season, and junior forward 
and guard Seth Henry, who 
?nished third in assists in 
2016-17, to make a big im-
pact and lead the team.
Make sure you watch 
for sophomore guard Zach 
Howarth, who had an in-
credible ?rst year, scoring 
170 points, the fourth most 
on the team. He’ll be look-
ing to avoid a sophomore 
slump and continue to help 
his team on the offensive 
end.
Junior forward and cen-
ter Patrick Ehland will be 
hard to miss in the pint, 
towering on the court 6’8”. 
Look for him to make a big 
defensive contribution, as 
he ?nished third in blocks, 
and fourth in rebounds last 
season.
Men’s conference play 
also starts Jan. 6 against 
Case Western. The Tartans 
defeated the Spartans twice 
last season, and hope to 
continue the win streak into 
this year. Be sure to stick 
around Skibo on Friday, 
Jan. 19, as the men take 
on the Maroons in their 
conference home opener. 
The Tartan men also have 
a two-game winning streak 
on their side against the 
Maroons, so look for a few 
more big wins this season.

Another week, another 
loss for me. My performance 
this year has been abysmal 
at best and this week was 
no different. With six teams 
out, attack of the bye week 
left most teams struggling 
to ?nd points. However, 
some managed to rise above 
and turn their backup play-
ers into ?rst-string points. 
Let’s take a look at how the 
week fared for The Tartan 
Fantasy League. 
Justin Tucker Must (not) 
Die over Drop it like it’s 
Crock 103.3–95.4
Despite Jacksonville 
Jaguars running back Leon-
ard Fournette’s unexpected 
benching, contributing 
editor Lula Beresford still 
managed to pull out a 
win. Philadelphia Eagles 
quarterback Carson Wentz 
de?nitely compensated for 
Fournette’s lack of points 
completing 15 of 27 pass-
es for 199 yards. He also 
managed four touchdowns 
in Philadelphia’s 51–23 
win over Denver. Carolina 
Panthers running back 
Christian McCaffrey also 
had a pretty solid perfor-
mance rushing 15 times 
for 66 yards and catch-
ing ?ve of six passes. With 
New Orleans Saints wide 
receiver Michael Thomas, 
Green Bay Packers wide 
receiver Davante Adams, 
and Washington Redskins 
tight end Vernon Davis all 
bringing in double-digit 
points, Beresford’s team 
?nished with a solid lead 
over mine. Dallas Cowboys 
quarterback Dak Prescott 
carried my team with two 
touchdowns, three carries, 
and 21 of 33 completed 
passes for a total of 26.7 
points. My next highest 
scoring player, Panthers 
wide receiver Devin 
Funchess, came in at 13.6 
points catching ?ve of sev-
en targets. I went into this 
week expecting to win, but 
my players had other plans.
Third–String Team over 
Easy Breesy 126.4–120.3
Well, this week the stu-
dent has become the master 
with assistant sports editor 
Marika Yang beating sports 
editor Ian Tanaya. Oakland 
Raiders running back 
Marshawn Lynch ?nally did 
what Yang drafted him to 
do carrying 14 times for 57 
yards and two touchdowns 
for a total of 20.3 points. 
Kansas City Chiefs tight end 
Travis Kelce also performed 
well catching seven of nine 
targets and a touchdown 
for 20.3 points as well. De-
spite Cincinnati Bengals 
wide receiver A.J. Green 
only bringing in 1.6 points, 
Yang still pulled off the vic-
tory. Tanaya saw most of his 
points come from Denver 
Broncos wide receiver 
Demaryius Thomas.

On nosy relatives
Hey Ruth,
So Thanksgiving Break is coming up (and after that 
winter break!) which means holidays, holidays, 
and more holidays. I can’t explain to you how 
excited I am for even one home cooked meal, 
and now I’ve got course after course of delicious 
holiday food coming my way.
I’m so hype to chow down and chill out, but I’m 
a little anxious about having to see my relatives. 
Don’t get me wrong, I love them, and I’m super 
excited to get to see them since it’s been so long, 
but every time I do they ask me what I’m doing at 
school and I. Don’t. Know. What. To. Say. It’s easy 
to assume that everyone here knows what I mean 
when I say I’m in 112 but no one in my family 
understands the nuance! “How’s school” is up 
there on my list of impossible questions with “are 
you dating anyone” when I’m not and “what are 
your plans for the future” when I don’t have any.
Too Many Inquiries
Dear TMI,
I am notorious among my friends for having an 
impossible to explain major. When I first started 
here I was the absolute worst at explaining what 
I was doing — thanks a lot, orientation week — 
but over the years I’ve picked up a few tricks to 
explain what you do at CMU to people who have 
no idea.
Basically, you want an elevator pitch. Sit down for 
roughly 20 minutes (maybe on the trip home) and 
figure out the best way to explain what you do in 
layman’s terms. Eliminate that jargon. It doesn’t 
have to cover every single niche aspect of your 
thing — and honestly, probably shouldn’t — but the 
more complete an explanation is, the sooner you 
won’t have to talk about it anymore. Add some 
examples of projects you’ve worked on, even if 
technically they were for a class, and you should 
be mostly set.
If you know that someone in your family has a 
more in-depth understanding of your field than 
other members, I’d also recommend preparing a 
variation on your basic spiel for them. Though, if 
you mostly know what you’re talking about you 
should be fine in winging it for someone else who 
knows what you’re talking about. 
Still, it’s good practice for that 30-second pitch 
every single career guidance person ever says you 
should have. (You should probably have one of 
those. At least by graduation.)
Basically, pick the thing you’re most excited about 
and interested in, because you’ll be less annoyed 
when repeatedly talking about it, and try to resist 
the urge to answer “how’s school” with “terrible 
and full of tears.” No one wants to hear that.
As for those other impossible questions? “Nope!” 
and a change of subject should be an acceptable 
answer to “are you dating anyone?” If it’s not, 
pick “Nope! I’m enjoying hanging out with 
my friends” or “Nope! Everyone on campus is 
disgusting and obsessed with these stupid stones” 
depending on how you’re feeling. 
The future plans answer changes depending 
on how close you are to graduation, but pick 
a point on the sliding scale between “I want to 
see where my program leads me” to “I want to 
see who will pay me enough to eat.” Or maybe 
“I’m thinking of applying to these places that 
people have heard of and we’ll see when I start 
getting responses.”
Good luck,
Ruth

Lydia Green | Operations ManagerBar Buddies: Mixtape
While Sinead continued on with her well-deserved 
break this week, I gathered up a different group 
of buddies and scoured the internet for a new bar 
to try. On a chilly Friday night, we decided that a 
bar called Mixtape would provide the perfect way 
to kick off Founder’s weekend.
The location: Mixtape is located on Penn Avenue 
right on the border of the hip neighborhoods 
Bloomfield and Garfield. Across the street is an 
art gallery, and down the block are a number of 
other bars and restaurants. The area feels like the 
type to be more likely inhabited by young urban 
professionals than your grandparents. Mixtape is 
a bit far from campus, so I’d recommend calling 
an Uber or Lyft, but the 64 bus will eventually get 
you there.
The drinks: Mixtape’s drinks menu is very cute, 
peppered with punny music-related drink names 
(“Major Tom” and “Avril LaGreen,” to name a 
couple). The drinks seem to be on the pricey side 
at first glance with $8-10 a cocktail, but a sign at 
the front of the bar states, “Please, No Tipping: 
We pay our employees for you. All items are 
priced accordingly in order to provide consistent 
living wages and paid sick days for all staff,” 
so the cost ends up roughly being the same as 
if you’d bought cheap drinks and tipped the 
bartender.
In terms of taste, the drinks are kind of mediocre. 
I ordered the “Tonight, Tonight” cocktail, which is 
an autumnal bourbon-based drink. Theoretically, 
the drink contains some apple cider, but the 
primary flavor I could taste was alcohol, with 
cinnamon as a close second. Perhaps I would have 
faired better with something else. 
My friend’s drink, a cocktail called “Hot and 
Dangerous,” was a bit better. Her drink was 
unusual, fruity with a slightly spicy kick. Also, 
the “Hot and Dangerous” is prepared with a 
blowtorch, so that was pretty cool (or, one might 
say, “lit”).
The vibe: This bar gives off a chill, vintage hipster 
vibe. There are probably more bean bag chairs 
than actual chairs at Mixtape, and there are 
various board games throughout the room. 
Additionally, Warhol-esque pop art drawings of 
various popular culture icons from the ‘80s and 
‘90s ranging from Molly Ringwald to Outkast 
line the walls. In addition to the no tipping sign, 
Mixtape proclaims its liberal management with 
another sign in support of the LGBTQ and refugee 
communities.
At 9 p.m. on a Friday night, Mixtape is packed, 
with a person in every beanbag chair and a long 
line for drinks, but the atmosphere is nonetheless 
relaxed. From the cozy beanbag chairs to the 
warm staff, the Mixtape vibe almost feels more 
like that of a coffee shop than that of a bar.
Lit or Nah: I’m gonna go ahead and say Mixtape 
is lit. Although the drinks we tried left something to 
be desired, Mixtape’s atmosphere is pleasing. 
This bar is a great place to come with a friend or 
two to relax in a beanbag chair, play a game of 
connect four, and catch up on each other’s lives, 
and it seems that Carnegie Mellon students would 
agree, as we saw a few enjoying themselves 
there already.
A mixed playlist of fun drinks and chill vibes

Have you ever considered what goes through your 
mind the moment you meet someone new? How 
much does someone’s physical appearance influ-
ence your impression of them when compared to 
their personality? The Ellis Gallery exhibit, Dine 
in the Dark: a Dinner pARTy, allowed visitors to 
explore those questions.
Dine in the Dark, displayed from Nov. 7 to Nov. 
10, was a project created by seniors Nick Boston, 
philosophy major; Sarah Stinson-Hurwitz, gender 
studies and art BHA; Faith Kaufman, design major; 
and junior Daniel See, decision science and art 
BHA, the same Carnegie Mellon students who put 
together The Holiday dinner party last month. That 
event, as well as this month’s Dine in the Dark, is a 
part of the students’ Dinner pARTy series, for which 
they host a “dinner party” event every month to 
bring together people from various backgrounds 
on campus.
The focus of the Dine in the Dark exhibit was to 
present the outcomes of an event they recently 
organized, in which ten people from the Carnegie 
Mellon community were randomly picked to have 
dinner with one another. What made this particular 
dinner unique was that everyone was blindfolded, 
and their identities had to remain anonymous 
until the end of the event. The guest list included 
three undergraduates, two graduate students, 
two campus police officers, two faculty members, 
and one staff member. Throughout the dinner, the 
guests were asked several questions that helped 
facilitate a fruitful discussion and to also allow 
everyone to get to know one another on a more 
personal level.
When I stepped into the Ellis Gallery, the first thing 
I noticed was the recording of the guests’ respons-
es to the questions that played all throughout the 
room. Hearing their voices as I walked around the 
exhibit made it feel as though I was present at the 
dinner. There was a long table at the center of the 
room that had dinner plates and utensils all set. 
Even though all the seats were empty, I could still 
easily imagine all the guests at the table.
Hand-drawn self-portraits of each of the attendees 
were hung up on the wall, and beside each por-
trait was a diagram that presented where they sat 
at the table. Some of the questions asked during 
the event were also displayed in the exhibit, along 
with the written responses of several of the guests. 
The questions were very random, but they gave 
guests the opportunity to reflect on their personal 
beliefs, decisions, and approaches to certain situ-
ations; an example of a question being, “What 
would you do if you had 24 hours left to live?” 
Visitors were even able to contribute to the din-
ner conversation by writing down answers to the 
questions on sticky notes and posting them on the 
wall. The entire interactive design of the exhibit 
was very well done, and it allowed visitors to expe-
rience the dinner party for themselves.
I attended The Holiday dinner party last month, 
and the main difference between my experience 
during that event and my visit to the Dine in the 
Dark exhibit was the people I was surrounded by. 
I was able to physically be around and mingle with 
so many different people during last month’s event 
compared to this month’s exhibit, which I visited by 
myself and was the only person physically present 
in the room at the time. 
What surprised me, however, was that I did not 
feel so alone when I was in the exhibit. Listening 
to the voices of the guests speak, viewing their 
creative self-portraits on the wall, and reading their 
very personal and relatable responses as well as 
others’ to the conversation questions, allowed me 
to create and attend my own version of that dinner 
party. It was truly fascinating that I was able to 
form a connection with the people who attended 
the event and/or visited the exhibit when I had 
never met them in person. The Dine in the Dark 
project helped me understand that physical appear-
ance (and presence in my case) is not essential to 
forming relationships with new people.

Privacy and performativity at The FrameWe have a future, perhaps
Audre Lorde wrote, “History is not kind to us / we 
restitch it with the living / past memory forward / 
into desire / into the panic articulation.”
Queer women don’t get to grow up seeing their 
own history, and so they don’t find validation 
and inspiration in those like them. In the summer 
of 2015, Hayley Kiyoko released the music video 
for “Girls like Girls.” For me, this was one of my 
first introductions to the possibility of queerness 
and fantasy. That same year, the Supreme Court 
legalized gay marriage in the United States. In the 
context of this sweeping social change, the music 
of artists like Hayley Kiyoko, Kehlani, and Halsey 
created spaces in pop music for girls to explore 
this idea of fantasy and self for those who couldn’t 
relate to the dominant brands of heterosexual femi-
nine fantasy like Taylor Swift or Ed Sheeran.
Since 2015, the political landscape has of course 
changed, with Trump quoted saying that Mike 
Pence wanted to “hang them all” in reference 
to gay rights and Betsy DeVos rolling back the 
Obama administration’s protections of LGBTQ 
students. In the face of policies driven by igno-
rance and hate, queer artists have refused to 
be silenced and are claiming their spaces with 
greater confidence.
It was from this mindset that Summer Leavitt began 
the work for her solo show We have a future, 
perhaps at The Frame gallery. After the election, 
she began to wrestle with her identity as a lesbian 
artist in the context of Trump’s America. She spent 
the year working with her own experiences and 
memory to use her work as an artist to immortal-
ize a piece of queer history. In her statement, 
Leavitt quotes Ann Cvetkovich: “In the absence of 
institutionalized documentation or in opposition 
to official histories, 
memory becomes a 
valuable historical 
resource, and ephem-
eral and personal 
collections of objects 
stand alongside the 
documents of the 
dominant culture 
in order to offer 
alternative modes of 
knowledge.”
And so, this show is 
about memory and 
nostalgia. Entering 
the gallery space, you are hit 
with the smell of soft perfumes and musk. The show 
is carefully curated, with minimalistic swatches of 
colors and intentionally placed pieces, intended 
to evoke all the senses with cola flavored lollipops 
and tactile paintings and performances. The gal-
lery is colored like Valentine’s Day, with a palette 
of pinks, reds, blacks, and purples. Leavitt herself 
pulls together this palette, clad together on an 
opening day in a bright red suit with matching lip-
stick.
This is fitting, perhaps, as this show is about work-
ing with performance. Her piece “Untitled (Wish 
You Were Here)” presents ongoing project where 
she exchanges a postcard with lipstick kisses with a 
lover. The back room holds a video piece entitled 
“The Mannish Strut of a Particularly Confident 
Woman.” Her work plays with the memories of 
self, lovers, and love.
On opposite ends of the room are paintings that 
draw from the era of Rothko and Pollock, artists 
who once represented 
pure American mascu-
linity. Leavitt has used 
these beautiful gradient 
pieces as self-portraiture, 
the first “Untitled (Spring, 
2015, Mixing Fluids and 
Dreaming, Ad Nauseum)” 
reflects on a relationship 
she had with a woman dur-
ing her time in Paris, whose 
perfume she would wear 
when she woke up with 
her every day. The paint-
ing is layers and layers of 
scent, trying to preserve the 
memory of this relationship 
by recreating her partner’s perfume.
On the opposite side of the room is a soft blush 
painting, made from canvas dyed with red wine, 
entitled “Untitled (Love Potion No. 3).” Leavitt 
talked about how she wears perfume and lipstick 
every day, so the presence of these materials 
in her work was essential to her work with self-
portraiture. The perfumes in this piece, in contrast 
to her first painting, is layered perfume and essen-
tial oils that she wears every day. This piece then 
emphasizes the question of self and immortalizes a 
routine vignette of her life.
In this way, the show is romantic, nostalgic, and 
longing. And as much as it is a beautiful glimpse 
into this intimate memory of the artist, the show 
is also conscious of the power to turn artists into 
cultural icons. At the same time as I was trying to 
understand the private world these pieces evoked, 
these performances and stories also allowed me to 
imagine more vividly the way my queerness could 
add richness to my own life — in terms of experi-
encing love as well as in confidence and explora-
tion of the self.
Art history is filled to the brim with male fantasy, 
and it is so exciting to see artist such as Summer 
Leavitt explore the possibilities of fantasy and 
memory in the context of femininity and queerness. 
With the continued absence of queer history, it is 
still novel and invigorating to see gay women living 
vibrant, exciting, and complicated lives. 
Art is about finding greater complexity in the 
world, the spaces and lives we could not previ-
ously explore. And so, for its tender and confident 
moments through the expertise of medium, I recom-
mend seeing this show before it closes on Nov. 20.

L
ist off as many Asian-American stars in Hollywood as you can. 
Most likely, you won’t use all ten of your fingers. You might 
not even use five. This is how YouTuber, actress, filmmaker, and 
owner of six cats Anna Akana started her lecture, sponsored by 
the Pitt Asian Students Alliance, on Asians in the entertainment 
industry, which took place at University of Pittsburgh’s William Pitt 
Union Friday, Nov. 10 at 6 p.m. Attracting not only Pitt students 
but Carnegie Mellon students and fans of her work, Anna Akana’s 
lecture was entertaining and insightful but also impactful, inspiring, 
and surprisingly personal in how she communicated, in how others 
responded to her, and in how I even felt about her.
After introducing herself, her YouTube channel, and her six (yes, 
six) cats, Akana talked about the lack of Asians in entertainment by 
breaking down the problem into a few main categories regarding 
their representation, such as yellowface, whitewashing, racial era-
sure, and stereotyping. While most of her lecture focused on issues 
I had heard about before, she incorporated a lot of her own per-
sonal stories to further highlight the issue and its seriousness. She 
discussed a few stories featured in her book, So Much I Want to 
Tell You, but still made everything she told fresh, new, and interest-
ing. She also made the solutions that she advocated for — support-
ing other works by Asian creators, speaking out on social media 
— appealing, emboldening people with the confidence to follow her 
advice and stand up in the greater public sphere for Asian repre-
sentation. I was still incredibly excited about what she would say 
and what to expect; for the first time, I was hearing someone talk 
about the kind of issues that I felt strongly and passionately about, 
and I couldn’t wait to hear about a perspective on these issues 
other than my own.
What truly spoke about the lecture and her character, however, 
was her interaction with the audience and the Q&A portion of her 
lecture. At the start of her lecture, she asked if anyone in the audi-
ence was considering a career in entertainment. Out of the 200 
people in the room, with 90 percent being Asian, three people 
raised their hand. She responded saying, “This lecture is for you,” 
starting her talk off on a personal and intimate vibe by helping to 
give these three people a perspective on the industry they wanted 
to work in. She also extended her Q&A portion by a few minutes, 
taking the time to candidly answer the audience’s questions about 
her own perspective on the industry, her personal experiences, and 
her six cats. She’d often have conversations with them too, making 
her only more open, lovely, relatable, and an amazing role model 
to the audience around her.
I’d gone through most of my high school career watching a lot of 6

vloggers on YouTube. While I thought classic stars such as Tyler 
Oakley, Dan Howell and Phil Lester, John Green, and Grace 
Helbig were just hilarious people, I had never connected with some-
one so instantly and personally as when I watched Anna Akana’s 
“Why Girls Should Ask Guys Out” in September, a week after 
getting rejected. Still feeling sour about my love life, I poured over 
more of her videos and instantly cheered up in finding a kindred 
spirit, regretting not fully discovering her earlier, but knowing that I 
wouldn’t have appreciated her then as much as I do now. In “I’ve 
Made a Horrible Mistake,” she said things I agreed with about 
regrets that I could never follow, and gave me the confidence to 
use that time I spent regretting things to do more. In “Can I be 
happy single?”, she encouraged me that being single gave me 
more of a chance to discover more about myself, and helped me 
to just live my life in the moment. In all her countless videos about 
Asian stereotypes, Asians in the media, and her one-off jokes blast-
ing whitewashing, she gave me a greater self-confidence to speak 
up more on this issue I strongly believed in. She was charming, 
funny, and most importantly, I saw myself in her. Thankfully, these 
were things that all resonated and remained true Friday night.
In just two months, Anna Akana helped me get in touch with who I 
am as a young Asian-American adult woman. In each of her four-
minute videos, I see myself nearly going into her situations, and her 
telling me what to do and what not to do. I see a common shared 
experience that goes beyond personality, and just beyond race. 
And last Friday, so did nearly 200 other young Asian adults. In 
her lecture and each of her 188 videos on her YouTube channel, 
Anna Akana never fails to be a reminder of why representation is 
important.

Alexandra Yu| StaffwriterReputation
Some love her, others hate her, but nobody can 
deny that Taylor Swift is one of the most influential 
singer-songwriters and pop stars of the 21st cen-
tury. With all of her previous five albums having 
over four million sales each in the U.S. alone, and 
with over 104 million and 85 million followers on 
Instagram and Twitter respectively, Swift has a 
huge presence around the globe. So when the con-
tent on all her social media accounts was removed 
in mid-August, people were in a frenzy trying to 
find out why. The answer was simple: Reputation.
Last Friday, Swift’s sixth album, Reputation, came 
out. While I initially had no plans of pick-
ing it up, curiosity won out over my 
cynicism, and I was not ready for what 
Reputation had in store. Although 
she claims in her new track “End 
Game (feat. Ed Sheeran and 
Future),” that “I don’t 
love the drama, it 
loves me,” through-
out the years 
many have questioned Swift’s true intentions and 
thought she merely donned a good girl persona 
for her own gain. While I’m not going to go into 
that debate, she is still one of the most well known 
and popular music artists, and the messages she 
sends through her actions, words, and lyrics mat-
ter, especially with an audience predominantly 
comprised of adolescent females.
In her new album, Swift reinvents herself and her 
music. She has always been pretty experimental 
with each new album, especially with Red and 
1989 finally transitioning her fully out of country 
and into the pop genre. However, Reputation is by 
far the most extreme and drastic change, not only 
to her sound but her image and whole persona. 
She has in some ways embraced her dark and less 
innocent side, and it seems to have worked out in 
her favor.
Swift’s first track on the album is “…Ready for It?” 
Although I initially hated it, after listening several 
more times, I have grown to appreciate the cre-
ative blend of sounds and musical styles through-
out the song. However, Swift’s rapping will never 
cease to be cringe worthy for me. She seems to be 
trying too hard to make it work, and it just doesn’t. 
The lyrics are good, but the execution is subpar. 
Although the flow of her rap is a bit questionable, 
it does manage to balance out with the lyrics and 
beautiful vocals in the chorus, and she surprisingly 
weaved them in well throughout the electronic and 
rap elements to produce a pretty decent song.
This blend of genres continues in many of the other 
tracks in the album, including “King of My Heart” 
and the mildly underwhelming collaboration with 
Ed Sheeran and Future, “End Game.” She not only 
blends genres and stretches her musical limits in 
the album, but also evokes other popular art-
ists in her songs as well, such as Halsey. Her 
versatility in the album does not stop with 
genre, however. The themes of her songs in 
this album encompass many different fields, 
including the obvious topic of reputation, but 
also the struggles of dealing with crushes and 
new loves, all the different stages of romantic 
relationships, backstabbing, and making mistakes. 
Swift in Reputation is by far the most multi-faceted 
Taylor Swift yet.
While “End Game” was not stylistically a favorite 
from the album, the message is clear. Despite hav-
ing a horrible record and reputation with romance, 
Swift sings about wanting long-term love and no 
drama. Due to her position in the spotlight, though, 
it is much harder to overcome mistakes and form 
those lasting relationships. This theme continues in 
“Dress,” with Swift singing about not only a physi-
cally intimate relationship, but also an emotional 
one where “even in [her] worst times, [he] could 
see the best of [her]” and “even in [her] worst 
lies, [he] saw the truth in [her],” as well as her 
final, most soulful track on the album, “New Year’s 
Day,” a sweet ballad where she expresses similar 
sentiments about being there at her love’s highest 
of highs and lowest of lows.
Swift also covers other areas in the romance 
department in her songs, not only covering lasting 
love but also doomed love in the emotional story 
in “Getaway Car” that is reminiscent of songs from 
Swift’s previous albums, Red and 1989, as well as 
the beginning stages of romance in “Delicate” and 
“Gorgeous.” Both “Delicate” and “Gorgeous” con-
sist of very simplistic lyrics, but the words ring true 
and are relatable to anyone who has met some-
one but has no idea how to handle the situation, 
either due to awkwardness or uncertainty when it 
comes to pace, or because of other variables like 
pre-existing relationships or being too attractive. 
“Gorgeous” in particular is super bouncy and fun, 
with the perfect sound effects and background 
music with the vocals, throwing back a bit to the 
“old Taylor” that Swift claims died, reminding me 
a tiny bit of her Fearless classic “You Belong with 
Me” and Carly Rae Jepsen’s 2012 hit, “Call Me 
Maybe.”
Although there are a couple songs about Swift’s 
backstabbers, such as “Look What You Made 
Me Do” and “This is Why We Can’t Have Nice 
Things,” both songs are catchy and take very dif-
ferent approaches to dealing with the same prob-
lem, likely Kanye West. In “Look What You Made 
Me Do,” she uses her past experiences to strength-
en herself and move up, while “This is Why We 
Can’t Have Nice Things” is an extremely fun track 
that twists something seemingly sweet and innocent 
into something complex and somewhat vengeful. 
This complexity and an almost oxymoronic contrast 
between lyrics and style make “This is Why We 
Can’t Have Nice Things” one of my favorite tracks 
from Reputation.
Despite still being skeptical after my first run 
through of the songs, the more I listened to 
the songs from Reputation, the better they got. 
Although the choruses of most of the songs were 
overly repetitive and took away from the songs’ 
fullest potential, Swift showed a new side of herself 
in Reputation. It may take some getting used to, 
but should be welcomed and appreciated for what 
it’s worth.
“I’m sorry, the old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now... Why? Oh, cause she’s dead!”

 The Carnegie Mellon Wind Ensemble on Nov. 12 was a concert encompassing works by composers 
whose wind compositions have become ubiquitous to greatness in the musical community. The 
ensemble started with Malcolm Arnold’s playful “Four Scottish Dances for Concert Band,” moved 
to the winding “Suite in Bb” by Richard Strauss, and inished with a David Maslanka’s “Symphonic 
Wind Ensemble.” The next event CMU School of Music will hold is the Jazz Orchestra concert on 
Wednesday, Nov. 15 in Kresge Theatre.
