“But how will I know if I have 
friends?” said first-year Sara- 
Anne Lee half-jokingly when she 
discovered that facebook.com 
was down for a day last week.
Lee is not alone in her reliance 
on Facebook — by late 2005, 
nearly 70 percent of Carnegie
Mellon undergraduates had pro­
files on facebook.com.
A Donner Hall community 
discussion last Tuesday focused 
on the astonishingly popular so­
cial networking website. Junior 
Pat Malatack, the Donner Hall 
Community -Advisor, kicked off 
a new discussion series with a 
talk about the issues regarding 
Facebook.
Malatack, a double major in
human-computer interaction and 
cognitive science, hopes that a 
community dialogue will help his 
residents learn from each other, 
especially about something as im­
portant as internet safety.
“I chose Facebook because 
there is a lot of interest and there 
is a lot of ignorance,” Malatack 
said, indicating that news sources 
like USA Today and The New 
York Times are starting to cover
privacy issues brought about by 
Facebook.
Tuesday’s discussion focused 
on several major issues, including 
the possibility that Facebook us­
ers are unaware of just how many 
people have access to the infor­
mation and images they post.
Employers such as Bose, Inc. 
have started looking at Facebook 
profiles before they hire employ­
ees, Malatack told students in the
discussion.
“Questions [employers] are not 
allowed to ask you, sexual prefer­
ence, what country you are from 
... they can find out on Facebook,” 
said Rowshan Palmer, coordina­
tor of student development and 
housefellow of Donner. “I’d like 
to believe that’s not how they 
would use it, but they could.”

Tepper 
Venture 
Challenge
Business contest 
awards $10,000
by Matthew McKee
Staffwriter
Many students would love 
to drop out of school and start 
their own business. Yesterday, 
one group of undergraduates 
proved that they could do just 
that.
The Tepper Venture Challenge 
(TVC), a competition simulating 
the proposal of entrepreneur­
ial ideas, ended yesterday 
after six final teams presented 
their business plans to 
venture capitalists and business­
men.
The judges awarded the grand 
prize of $5000 to “Envivial” 
from Carnegie Mellon, a team 
composed of Kyle Langworthy, 
Joseph Damato, and Matthew 
Humphrey. Coming in second 
with an award of $3000 was the 
team “Acadaid,” and the team 
“Medimaging” took the third 
prize of $2000.
The TVC began when teams 
submitted executive summaries 
for review at the beginning of 
March. After that, the judges 
chose six teams to compete in 
the finals.
To encourage open-ended 
creativity, the TVC had no offi­
cial guidelines for ideas, and the 
summaries could be as long or 
short as the teams chose.
“We can give guidelines, but 
in the end, if it looks solid, it will 
come through no matter what,” 
said Saravana Sivasankaran, a 
junior in electrical and computer 
engineering and chair of the 
TVC.
Teams from all over Pennsyl­
vania could enter, and a record 
34 teams competed for a chance 
to win a part of the $10,000.
At the finals, qualifying teams 
from Carnegie Mellon and 
University of Pittsburgh each 
presented their ideas for 10 min­
utes to a panel of real venture 
capitalists and businessmen. 
Then the judges had 10 minutes 
to question each team and cri­
tique their ideas.
“There are not very many 
undergraduate entrepreneur­
ship competitions,” said Arthur 
Boni, the deputy director of 
the Donald H. Jones Center 
for Entrepreneurship in the Tep­
per School.
“It allows for an experi­
ence much like going for 
investors. Feedback itself ... 
is one of the best learning 
experiences.”
This is the first year that 
the TVC has been open 
to schools across Pennsylvania.

Poll to deliberate 
student bill of rights
by Claire Morgenstern
Staffwriter
Is a student’s right to be 
graded fairly important enough 
to warrant an amendment to 
Carnegie Mellon’s Student Bill 
of Rights? It’s important enough, 
the Southwestern Pennsylva­
nia Program for Deliberative 
Democracy thinks, to hold a 
deliberative poll on the subject 
next Tuesday.
Randy Weinsten, a Coro Fel­
low in Local Democracy and 
2005 Carnegie Mellon graduate, 
has organized the event along 
with junior Michael R. Bueti, 
chair of the Academic Affairs 
committee of Student Senate, 
and numerous Carnegie Mellon 
faculty members.
“We hope the poll will help 
stimulate discussion of students’
rights issues within the Carnegie 
Mellon community,” Weinsten 
said, “and the data will help us 
gain insight into the views of the 
community on this issue.”
According to the committee’s 
“Campus Conversations: The
Carnegie Mellon Students’ Rights 
Policy” information packet, there 
are many possible courses of 
action within three general 
directions. Carnegie Mellon 
could adopt the Student Bill of 
Rights, retain its current policy, 
or modify current policy with 
the addition of the proposed 
amendment.
As Weinsten explained, the 
deliberative poll participants will 
first be briefed on background 
information and perspectives 
surrounding the issue prior to 
the event.

Recent efforts by Carnegie 
Mellon to boost black graduation 
rates went unnoticed this year.
A national journal ranked the 
University as having the lowest 
of such rates for black students 
among “high-ranking universi­
ties.” But the journal’s statistics 
do not match the statistics pro­
vided by Carnegie Mellon. The 
University’s rate in actuality may 
be much higher than reported, 
and even higher than some 
historically black colleges and 
universities.
The study was published in 
the Journal of Blacks in Higher 
Education’s (JBHE) Winter 2005 
edition in an article titled “Black 
Student College Graduation 
Rates Remain Low, But Modest 
Progress Begins to Show.”
Data were compiled from 
the National Collegiate Athlet­
ics Association (NCAA) regard­
ing graduation rates from top 
universities across the country, 
including Harvard University, 
Stanford University, and Massa­
chusetts Institute of Technology.
Among the rankings, Harvard’s 
percentage rates were highest, 
with approximately 95 percent 
of their black students graduat­
ing. According to the same study, 
Carnegie Mellon ranked well be­
low that statistic, with only 65 
percent of its black student popu­
lation graduating.
Yet data released by the 
University, as well as the Depart­
ment of Education, suggest that 
the graduation rate for black 
students at Carnegie Mellon is 
actually higher. According to the 
sources, the current rate at Carn­
egie Mellon is approximately 72 
percent, seven percent greater 
than the 65 percent projected by 
JBHE.
“We get our statistics from the 
NCAA because they’re first to post 
them,” said Caroline Gelb, associ­
ate editor of JBHE in a phone in­
terview, “and we feel that they’re 
probably pretty accurate.”

Students vote in mock Israeli elections

Staffwriter
In the wake of recent political 
reshuffling, polls opened to mil­
lions of Israeli voters last Tuesday. 
Halfway around the globe, Tar­
tans for Israel ended mock elec­
tions at Carnegie Mellon.
Centrist party Kadima claimed 
28 of the 120 Knesset seats in the 
actual Israeli elections, followed 
by the left-wing Labor party with 
20 seats and right-wing Likud 
party with 11 seats.
“The far right and the far left 
got clobbered,” said military and 
political analyst Elliot Chodoff, 
speaking of the election results 
last Wednesday in Porter Hall. A 
specialist in terrorism, sociology, 
and Middle East conflict, Chodoff 
spoke to Carnegie Mellon stu­
dents about the impact of the Is­
raeli elections.
“Peace is certainly not on the 
horizon,” Chodoff said.

Elliot Chodoff discussed the Israeli election last Wednesday in Porter Hall.
He noted, however, that Kad­
ima is a pragmatic party looking 
to find solutions to problems. 
Furthermore, horizons for peace 
may not be visible simply because 
of current positions, he said.
Hasbara Fellowships, a pro- 
Israel activist program for college 
students, ran the event and com­
piled mock election results from 
across the country. The results
differed from the actual elec­
tion results, with Likud claiming 
44 out of 120 seats, followed by 
Kadima with 33 seats.
At Carnegie Mellon, the spon­
soring organization provided 
students with candidate informa­
tion and the chance to vote in the 
Israeli mock election. They closed

Two lectures and a newly ap­
pointed dean of Student Affairs 
will usher in the first week of 
April on the Carnegie Mellon 
campus.
The new appointment of 
the dean of Student Affairs 
will be announced this 
morning at 11:30 am in the 
University Center’s McConomy 
Auditorium.
The selection process for the 
position began last April when 
former Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy took the 
position of associate vice-presi­
dent. Associate Dean of Student 
Affairs Jennifer Church took his 
position last fall and has since
served as the campus’s interim 
dean.
An 18-person selection com­
mittee led the search to fill the 
position, which formally began 
last fall. Before spring break, 
three final candidates held 
forums as a final part in the 
selection process.
Departments that the new 
dean will oversee include the 
Career Center, Counseling 
and Psychological Services, 
Health Services, the Office of 
International Education, the 
Office of Orientation & First Year 
Programs, Student Activities, 
Student Development, and 
Student Life.
If you missed the announce­
ment today, www.thetartan.org 
has the updated announcement 
regarding the new dean.
Also today, Philip Landrigan 
will speak in a lecture titled 
“Children’s Health and the 
Environment — The Problem 
and the Solution.”
Landrigan is the head of the 
Department of Community and 
Preventative Medicine at Mount 
Sinai School of Medicine and 
Director of Mount Sinai’s Center 
for Children’s Health and the 
Environment in New York City.
Working with the Epidemic 
Intelligence Service, Landrigan 
spent 15 years studying the 
dangers of lead and other tox­
ins to children. He is a graduate 
of Harvard Medical School and 
has worked at Mount Sinai since 
1985.
The talk is planned for 4:30 
pm today in the Adamson Wing, 
Baker Hall 136A. It is part of the
University Lecture Series.
Susan Polansky, associate 
head of modern languages and 
teaching professor of Hispanic 
studies at Carnegie Mellon will 
speak Thursday.
Polansky has taught courses 
about Spanish language and cul­
ture, including “Reflections on 
Food in the Spanish-Speaking 
World.” Her research focuses on 
modern Spanish literature and 
the development of Spanish 
teaching tools. Polansky has 
written several books, includ­
ing textbooks and articles.
Her lecture “Lessons

Today, The Tartan returns to pub­
lishing its annual April Fool’s issue. 
The 2004 joke issue, called The Natrat 
(“Tartan” spelled backwards), hinged 
on disgracefully offensive and tasteless 
material and nearly resulted in the col­
lapse of the organization. After a year’s 
absence, we have made the decision 
to reclaim the tradition for its original 
purpose: intelligent satire.
But as we move forward, let’s take 
this opportunity to remember the past. 
History is the greatest teacher.
On April 1, 2004, The Tartan 
published racist, misogynistic, and de­
meaning content that set the Carnegie 
Mellon campus ablaze. I’d been study­
ing at another university when The 
Natrat was published, but I was taken 
aback just hearing my friends’ accounts 
of the issue’s publication and the af­
termath. It was clear that the event 
struck a sensitive nerve; it exposed 
and inflamed underlying issues of the 
Carnegie Mellon community.
The reaction was strong. Students 
lobbied to expel those responsible. 
University President Jared Cohon con­
demned the author of the egregious 
piece and the editors who let it run. The 
Tartan stopped publishing for the first 
time in years. Everyone on campus was 
left enraged, bitter, and disillusioned.
But in the months following April 
1, 2004, students spoke up in public 
forums, wrote about their experiences, 
and talked with each other. A commis­
sion led by John Hannon, of the Office 
of Student Development, worked with 
The Tartan to help it get back on its 
feet and moving in the right direction. 
Members of Carnegie Mellon’s adminis­
tration had a new reason to think hard 
about the issues of respect, diversity, 
and creating an inclusive community. 
In short, we were able to channel much 
of the anger, pain, and disappointment 
that the event caused into finding posi­
tive approaches to solving the problems 
our campus was facing.
Shortly after stepping into my current 
role, I wrote in this column, “The explo­
sive, fiery debate ignited by the 2004 
‘Natrat’ taught this community a lot 
about itself. But the fire has died. Our 
campus has returned to its aloof status 
quo: an environment bereft of debate 
among most students. In such an atmo­
sphere, underlying problems will not 
change, and it is inevitable that some 
event in the future will cause another 
wildfire of anger and disgust.” Exactly 
one month later, Malik Zulu Shabazz, 
the bigoted and militant leader of 
the New Black Panther Party for Self 
Defense, provided just that event.
Again, the campus was in an uproar. 
It felt as though we’d learned nothing. 
But through forums, debates, and dis­
cussions, our community turned it into 
something that was largely positive.
I remember feeling distinctly un­
comfortable each time The Natrat was 
mentioned in the public forums after 
Shabazz’s visit to campus. For a long 
time, I’d hoped that the campus would 
forget The Natrat as quickly as possible. 
I came to understand, however, that 
students’ memories of The Natrat in­
formed the discussion about Shabazz, 
just as their memories of Shabazz will 
some day inform the way they think 
about the next controversy they will 
inevitably face.
It sometimes seems that the crisis 
situations are the only times the big 
issues, such as race, sexuality, and 
many others, get any attention on a 
broad scale. Of course, they come up 
briefly when first-years arrive, but after 
that there isn’t much. By and large, we 
depend on controversy.
That’s not all bad. Those experiences 
are the most potent. But by engender­
ing a more robust discussion around 
the hot issues when we’re not in crisis­
mode and people aren’t so emotional, 
we will be better prepared to process 
the complexities of crises when they 
happen — and they will.
It is all of our responsibility to hold 
onto the memory of our recent history 
and use it to find new ways for the 
members of our community to address 
the many sensitive issues that have 
challenged us time and again.

Poll will deliberate 
student bill of rights
POLLING, from A1
On the day of the event, they 
will discuss their reactions to 
the material in small groups of 
randomly-selected participants.
Their conclusions will then 
be turned into data, which will 
become a factor in the deci­
sion-making process of campus 
policy-makers.
The process of changing Uni­
versity policy is neither easy nor 
expedient. In the weeks follow­
ing the orig­
inal draft­
ing of the 
proposed 
amendment 
last No­
vember, the 
Academic 
Affairs Com­
mittee held 
a forum
open to all 
members of the Carnegie Mel­
lon community to discuss and 
raise awareness of the proposal.
In February, Student Senate 
approved the resolution sup­
porting the amendment, only 
to be vetoed a week later by 
Student Body President Tom 
Sabram. At the same time, the 
Academic Affairs Committee 
stated that they would no longer 
support the resolution.
Most recently, in March the 
Carnegie Mellon Faculty Senate 
passed a resolution condemning 
a bill containing a version of the 
Academic Bill of Rights for the 
state of Pennsylvania.
Sabram vetoed the February 
resolution not solely because 
of its content or a weak major­
ity of Senators in its support, 
but also because of lack of 
input from the student body, 
according to Sabram’s “Presi­
dential Perspectives” column 
printed in The Tartan on 
February 13.
“I felt Senate had not talked 
to its constituents because every 
time I asked about how many 
people talked to their friends/ 
constituents only two or so had 
said yes,” Sabram stated in an 
e-mail message regarding his
original decision to veto the 
resolution.
Sabram also pointed out 
the benefits for individuals 
who choose to participate in the 
poll.
“[Participating in the poll] 
will provide community mem­
bers the opportunity to learn 
background knowledge on the 
issue nationally and how it will 
affect our campus so they can 
make more educated decisions,” 
Sabram said. “Learning about 
the issue 
gives them 
the oppor­
tunity to 
converse 
with other 
students 
on this 
campus 
and chal­
lenge the 
way they 
think.”
Sabram and Weinsten agreed 
that the deliberative poll pro­
vides an effective way to get an 
engaged audience and educate 
others en masse.
In order to get as random 
a sample as possible, Sabram 
added, poll organizers will 
gather two students from each 
of Carnegie Mellon’s student or­
ganizations and poll them if the 
sample obtained through the 
self-selection process isn’t diver­
sified enough.
“We want to give as edu­
cated an estimate as possible on 
how students feel on an issue,” 
Sabram said.
He noted the only disadvan­
tage of the poll is that the leader 
of the discussion could cause 
participants’ views to be unfairly 
challenged — ironically, one of 
the problems that the Student 
Bill of Rights is designed to 
eradicate.
The poll, tided “Campus 
Conversations: The Carnegie 
Mellon Students’ Rights Policy,” 
will take place in Baker and 
Porter halls on Tuesday, April 
11, from 5:30 to 8:30 pm. Reg­
istration begins at 5 pm outside 
Porter Hall 100.
“We want to give as 
educated an estimate as 
possible on how students 
feel on an issue.”

WHAT KIND OFCHANGEARE YOU GOING TOMAKE TO EARN
Donner discussion warns students about Facebook
FACEBOOK, from A1
Bose, however, is not the 
only coippany scoping college 
students out. According to 
Malatack, Facebook sells all of 
its information to advertisers 
at a hefty price and any adver­
tiser that pays for ad space on 
Facebook has free reign over all 
Facebook profiles.
He also noted the difficulty in 
keeping information safe from 
advertisers.
“You can choose not to have 
your information sold, but, as 
someone at the discussion said, 
you have to go through seven dif­
ferent links to get there and then 
click something that doesn’t look 
like a hyperlink,” Malatack said in 
an interview after the discussion.
Communications giant Viacom 
certainly understands how 
valuable the information on 
Facebook is. According to the 
March 28 Business Week arti­
cle “Facebook for Sale; But $2 
billion?,” Viacom offered the 
owners of Facebook $75 million 
for their creation.
Facebook rejected the offer; 
they want $2 billion.
Businesses are nbt the only 
institutions using Facebook to 
look at what students are do­
ing and saying. Many universities 
are monitoring their students as 
well.
According to a report by Brock 
Read titled “Think Before You 
Share” in The Chronicle of Higher 
Education, Ohio State University 
officials used Facebook to ap­
prehend students after football 
rioting last October.
The university’s assistant direc­
tor of police received a tip that 
students had posted pictures on­
line of friends storming the field. 
After logging onto Facebook, the 
campus police found a group of 
students who had rushed the 
field.
According to Read, it only took 
a few days and a few clicks of the 
mouse for campus police to iden­
tify the offenders and refer about 
50 students to the university’s 
office of judicial affairs.
Loyola University Chicago 
even went so far as to ban certain 
students from being on Facebook. 
According to Malatack, all of 
Loyola’s athletes were told to 
get rid of their Facebook profiles 
if they wanted to keep playing.

addressed were privacy issues, including national companies that can solicit student information.
Loyola’s concern was that state­
ments or pictures on Facebook 
could implicate their athletes in 
activities that violate the code of 
conduct every athlete signs upon 
matriculation to the university.
A USA Today article from ear­
lier this month indicates that 
Florida State University has 
joined Loyola in banning athletes 
from Facebook.
Currently, Carnegie Mellon 
University does not use Facebook 
to investigate students, and both 
Palmer and Malatack agree that 
they do not foresee the University 
using it in the future.
Palmer, who occasion­
ally accesses Facebook to look 
students up, says that she encour­
ages students not to be careless 
on their Facebook accounts.
“I may have a conversation 
with them and ask if they are 
aware of who has access to this,” 
Palmer said, voicing concern that 
Facebook profiles may be making 
first impressions on behalf of the 
users. “Is this the image you want 
to put out there?”
Palmer, Malatack, and those 
who attended the Donner dis­
cussion are not the only ones 
who are interested in Facebook at 
Carnegie Mellon.
In 2005, professors Alessandro 
Acquisti of the Heinz School 
and Ralph Gross of the School 
of Computer Science published 
a report titled “Information 
Revelation and Privacy in Online 
Social Networks” with Facebook 
as their prime example. Acquisti 
and Gross researched thousands 
of Carnegie Mellon Facebook 
users.
“In our study of more than 4000 
CMU users of the Facebook, we 
have quantified individuals’ will­
ingness to provide large amounts 
of personal information in an on­
line social network, and we have 
shown how unconcerned its us­
ers appear to privacy risks,” the 
report stated.
“Based on the information 
they provide online, users expose 
themselves to various physical 
and cyber risks, and make it ex­
tremely easy for third parties to 
create digital dossiers of their 
behavior.”
Though their work is not done, 
Acquisti and Gross attributed 
such behavior on the part of stu­
dents to a number of different 
sources. They explain that users 
may publish personal informa­
tion “because the benefits they 
expect from public disclosure
surpass its perceived costs.”
“Peer pressure and herding 
behavior may also be influenc­
ing factors, and so also myopic 
privacy attitudes and the sense 
of protection offered by the 
(perceived) bounds of a campus 
community,” Acquisti and Gross 
stated.
Malatack and Palmer are not 
concerned that students áre cur­
rently any more or less unruly 
than they have ever been, but the 
advent of websites like Facebook 
and Myspace means that there 
is digital documentation of the 
choices that a particular user 
makes.
Palmer, however, would have 
people focus on the better aspects 
of Facebook as well.
“Facebook has created a huge 
social web. There is no way you 
could do this by just walking 
around meeting people,” Palmer 
said.
Malatack agreed.
“We shouldn’t focus on the 
bad. There is a lot of good,” he 
said, explaining that as a CA, 
he often uses Facebook to get to 
know his residents and advertise 
his community events.
Malatack used Facebook to ad­
vertise Tuesday’s discussion.

Venture Challenge awards $10,000Campus holds mock Israeli elections
CHALLENGE, from A1
preneurship Association (UEA).
The UEA’s membership has 
doubled since last spring, and 
the group is beginning to sponsor 
new competitions.
Boni said the Tepper School of 
Business is a pioneer of education 
in entrepreneurship.
“The business plan competi­
tion is a very important part of 
what we do,” Boni said. “It’s a 
very, very good mechanism for 
[proposing ideas].”
Sivasankaran believes there 
is great enthusiasm for entre­
preneurs in the UEA; he noted 
that many students will leave 
Carnegie Mellon to pursue their 
ideas.
Boni, who expressed his con­
fidence in the Carnegie Mellon 
entrepreneurship program, be­
lieves that students who take the 
courses of his department have a 
competitive edge.
Langworthy, a junior 
finance major who has not 
taken a curricular course in 
entrepreneurship, and his two
teammates took their winning 
team “Envivial” in front of the 
judges and presented the idea 
during the finals of Sunday’s com­
petition they had developed since 
the summer.
“We’re looking for help with 
how to argue a pitch,” said Lang­
worthy. “For the most part, I’m 
not looking for positive feed­
back.”
Langworthy intends to develop 
his idea into his own business. He
sees the TVC as helpful but not 
necessary.
“This is not a vivifying compe­
tition. Whether I win or lose, it 
doesn’t matter.”
Finishing in first place, 
“Envivial” won $5000 in legal 
services from the law firm Meyer, 
Unkovic, and Scott, LLP.

ELECTIONS, from A1
their polls last Monday night after 
a week and a half of tabling.
Tartans for Israel kept bobble- 
head dolls of the politicians at the 
table, according to sophomore 
psychology major and group 
member Rachel Goykhman.
“It gets, people laughing; it 
gets people interested,” she 
said.
Even though elections are over, 
an uncertain future lies ahead, 
Goykhman said. In the Israeli 
electoral system, a party must re­
ceive a majority vote of 61 seats to 
govern on its own — otherwise, 
it must form a collaboration with 
other parties.
“[Kadima] won the election, 
but it’s not a very strong 
government,” Goykhman pointed 
out.
Having won only 28 Knesset 
seats, Kadima must form a po­
litical coalition in order to reach
61 seats, she explained.
Parties receive Knesset seats 
in proportion to their number
of votes.
“In Israel, your vote physically 
matters because you physically 
elect someone to parliament,” 
said Marie Yetsin, senior 
economics major and Tartans for
“We don’t know 
what’s going to 
happen.”

Yetsin
Israel leader.
In this election, much focus has 
been placed on previous Kadima 
leader Ariel Sharon, who left the 
Likud Party following its 2003 
landslide victory to form the 
Kadima party, Yetsin explained.
“This isn’t who they elected,” 
Yetsin said, referring to Sharon’s
change in stance from anti- to 
pro-disengagement in Gaza.
Goykhman agreed. “It just up­
set the entire political spectrum,” 
she said.
Acting Prime Minister Ehud 
Olmert claimed victory for 
the Kadima party in Hiesday’s 
elections, according to the Asso­
ciated Press. Olmert took over for 
Sharon following Sharon’s stroke 
in January.
“We are prepared to compro­
mise, give up parts of our beloved 
land of Israel, remove, painfully, 
Jews who live there, to allow 
you the conditions to achieve 
your hopes and to live in a state 
in peace and quiet,” Olmert said 
toward Palestinians in Jerusa­
lem, according to an Associated 
Press article last week.
With the centrist party Kad­
ima entering in on a historically 
two-sided match between the 
ideological Likud and Labor par­
ties, Yetsin noted that uncertainty 
continues.
“We don’t know what’s going 
to happen,” she said.

liefs that blacks do not have the 
intellectual capacity of succeed in 
these disciplines,” Slater wrote in 
his article. However, in a phone 
interview, Slater did not comment 
on how he obtained his data.
In response to JBHE, Elliott 
mentioned current initiatives at 
Carnegie Mellon geared toward 
boosting black participation in 
the sciences. Specifically, he 
mentioned reinstatement of the 
Summer Academy for Math and 
Sciences, a program that helps to 
bring minority students to Pitts­
burgh during the summer to get 
them interested in enrolling at 
Carnegie Mellon.
“Yes, at one time it may have 
been race exclusive,” Elliott said. 
“It is now not.”
And Carnegie Mellon is be­
ginning to see progress. Cohon 
speculated that the retention rate 
for the current graduating class 
is somewhere between 80 and 90 
percent.
“Subsequently the graduation 
rate will be higher,” Cohon said.

BLACK, from A1
provided by the NCAA, Carnegie 
Mellon’s black graduation rate 
was still listed as 72 percent.
What did match with JBHE's 
statistic was the four-year average 
graduation rate, which included 
the most recent statistic and also 
the statistics from the three previ­
ous years.
It was Carnegie Mellon’s four- 
year average graduation rate that 
was listed as being 65 percent.
William Elliott, vice-president 
for enrollment at Carnegie Mel­
lon, explained that there is a 
delay in reporting the statistics of 
classes that have already gradu­
ated.
“If we have 100 entering stu­
dents and by the time they all 
graduate there are only 97, I 
track where those three students 
dropped down, and this process 
is done for over six years,” Elliott 
said
Elliott went on to explain that 
the statistics compiled from this
process are what the federal gov­
ernment and the NCAA look at 
before publishing their data.
However, the current data does 
not describe the statistics for the 
most recently graduated class.
“Quite frankly, the numbers 
in a graduating class won’t get 
recorded until two years after 
you graduate,” Elliott said. “The 
current data is from the enter­
ing class of 1999, so any progress 
we’ve recently made in minority 
graduation rates won’t be seen for 
years and years.”
Carnegie Mellon’s situation
Even with the most current sta­
tistic, Carnegie Mellon remains 
significantly behind its peer insti­
tutions such as Stanford Univer­
sity, whose graduation rate is 89 
percent for its black students.
According to JBHE, social en­
vironments on a given campus 
could lead to low graduation 
rates for its minority students, 
especially if those students leave
that institution for another.
“Clearly, the racial climate at 
some colleges and universities 
is more favorable toward Afri­
can-Americans than at other 
campuses,” stated Robert Slater, 
managing editor of JBHE and 
author of the article.
However, the graduation rate 
for black students at Carnegie 
Mellon is higher than the rate for 
black students at Howard Uni­
versity, which JBHE denotes as a 
“historically black university.”
Carnegie Mellon President 
Jared Cohon also acknowledged 
the role that racial climate plays 
on campuses, saying that he 
hoped the current actions done by 
various organizations at Carnegie 
Mellon would help to improve 
the quality of student life, 
“thereby increasing the number 
of students who stay.”
“Our efforts then improve the 
quality of life for black and His­
panic students,” Cohon said. “And 
I think that our efforts have been 
successful.”
Current initiatives on campus
The Diversity Advisory Council 
(DAC) is Carnegie Mellon’s lead­
ing source for campus initiatives 
to boost the quality of life on cam­
pus for its minority students. The 
DAC also records the population 
levels of minority students on 
campus.
“Diversity, in all of the mean­
ings of that word, is one of Carn­
egie Mellon’s strategic priorities,” 
Cohon stated in his letter included 
in the DAC’s annual report.
Cohon also chairs the council, 
which is responsible for current 
initiatives including minority 
recruitment.
One such initiative started by 
the the DAC is the Role Models 
Program, which provides “tutor­
ing programs that bring Carnegie 
Mellon undergraduates into pre­
dominantly African-American 
city schools,” according to the 
DAG’s position paper.
Yet because the DAC’s initia­
tives occurred after 1999, Cohon
and Elliott both noted the effects 
would not yet be seen.
“Our great improvement in 
retention, both for the overall 
student body, and for black and 
Hispanic students, is still very re­
cent,” Cohon said.
“It’s still working its way 
through the system. It takes six 
years for that. To a journal like 
JBHE, it’s a subtlety that escapes 
them.”
JBHE did acknowledge the 
recent efforts to boost black grad­
uation rates at Carnegie Mellon.
“Far more impressive is the 18- 
percentage-point increase in the 
black student graduation rate 
at Carnegie Mellon University 
[since 1998],” Slater stated in the 
article.
However, Carnegie Mellon’s 
reputation as being oriented to­
ward the sciences was subject to 
some scrutiny by JBHE.
“Black students in the sciences 
often have been made to feel un­
comfortable by white faculty and 
administrators who persist in be­

Pitt researchers discover brain’s dopamine signal
by Disha Shah
Staffwriter
Have you ever wondered why 
people become addicted to drugs 
and sex knowing that it is poten­
tially damaging to them? This 
question could be answered by 
understanding the effects of the 
hormone and neurotransmit­
ter dopamine. Recent research 
has indicated that dopamine has 
a significant role in brain plea­
sure pathways and has led to 
the understanding of multiple 
psychological diseases.
Dopamine is a neurotransmit­
ter that plays a crucial role in 
addiction by operating through 
the reward-signaling system in 
the brain. It is a precursor to 
adrenaline and plays a pivotal role 
in brain processes that control 
movement, emotional response, 
and the ability to experience 
pleasure and pain. Pleasurable 
activities like eating, drinking, 
and having sex are all associated 
with elevated dopamine levels in 
the brain.
Courtesy of www.esi-topics.com
Dr. Anthony Grace was head of the 
dopamine research project.
On the other hand, dopamine 
levels decrease in an individual’s 
brain when the person'is expe­
riencing anxiety or depression. 
Many drugs that give “calming” 
highs, like cocaine and nicotine, 
appear to work by simulating the
effects of dopamine in the brain. 
Due to this, dopamine is called 
the “pleasure hormone.” Dopa­
mine secreted in the body also 
causes schizophrenics to experi­
ence hallucinations.
When a person gets a sud­
den urge for pleasure-related 
activités, it is actually the do­
pamine neurons “burst firing.” 
This so-called burst firing is what 
channels goal-directed behavior 
in people.
Research done at the University 
of Pittsburgh recently attempted 
to study the cause of the neural 
burst. “We had a long-standing 
interest in the dopamine system,” 
said Anthony Grace, professor 
of neuroscience, psychiatry, and 
psychology and head of the proj­
ect along with Pitt neuroscience 
research associate Daniel Lodge. 
“The current treatments for cur­
ing schizophrenia and other such 
related diseases block all the do­
pamine secrete'd by the neurons. 
However, some of this dopamine 
is necessary for cognition.”
See DOPAMINE, page A7

The diagram reveals dopamine pathways in the brain. The first extends 
from the substantia nigra to the caudate neostriatum, the second pathway 
projects from the ventral tegmentum to the mesolimbic forebrain, and the 
third pathway is known as the tubero-infundibular system.
Global warming poses threat to environmental stability
by Simran Grover
Junior Staffwriter
“I got the right temperature to 
shelter you from the storm....” 
Sean Paul definitely has the right 
idea: It is getting hot in here! 
The Earth has not only been 
plagued with unpredictable cli­
mate changes, but also with a 
flurry of legislation and outcry 
from activist groups. What could 
be causing this rapid change and 
upheaval? Global warming may 
be the answer. .
Global warming is a tempera­
ture rise of the Earth’s oceans 
and atmosphere caused by the 
burning of fossil fuels and indus­
trial pollutants. This releases a 
major pollutant — carbon diox­
ide — into the atmosphere, con­
tributing to the greenhouse effect
— a phrase for the Earth’s atmo­
sphere trapping the energy from 
the sun. Water vapor, carbon 
dioxide, nitrous oxide, and meth­
ane are all partially responsible 
for this phenomenon. Without 
these gases, heat would escape 
into space, and the average tem­
perature of the Earth would be 
about 60°F cooler, according to 
an EPA report. Unfortunately, 
because of the increase in car­
bon dioxide, more and more heat 
is getting trapped within the
Earth’s atmosphere.
Electricity production is one 
factor to blame, causing 35 per­
cent of global carbon emissions. 
The burning of forests releases 
about two billion metric tons of 
carbon dioxide into the atmo­
sphere each year, or about 22 per­
cent of carbon dioxide emissions. 
Carbon is also emitted from cars, 
cement production, aerosols, and 
burning fossil fuels.
Global warming is heating 
Earth and is causing devastating 
effects on the environment, said 
a report by the Pew Center on 
Global Climate Change. Glaciers 
are disappearing, causing water 
levels to rise in oceans world­
wide; soon, many islands and 
coastlines may be significantly 
altered and, in rare cases, might 
disappear from the map alto­
gether. Weather pattern shifts 
are causing hotter-than-ever heat 
waves, the spread of disease, 
and record fatalities all over the 
world. Numerous droughts are 
causing prolonged wildfires and 
the destruction of the natural 
habitats of many species.
Popular belief is that global 
warming is an issue that will take 
years to develop and does not 
deserve the immediate attention 
of lawmakers. Some believe that 
the rising temperatures are due 
to natural, rather than human,
occurrences, such an increase 
in the sun’s output or volcanic 
eruptions. Also, the most drastic 
temperature increase occurred in 
the first half of the 20th century, 
not the in the last 20 years like 
the media have reported.
The evidence, however, is in­
conclusive. Temperatures and 
the rise of carbon dioxide have 
changed drastically over centu­
ries, not decades, as has been 
the recent trend. Therefore, 
due to the urgency of global 
warming, the Kyoto Treaty 
of February 2005 encouraged 
reducing carbon emissions to 
the 1990 level by 2012.
The United States refused to 
sign the treaty during both the 
Clinton and Bush administra­
tions. The Kyoto Protocol does 
not apply to developing countries 
such as India or China, based on 
the belief that reducing pollution 
would interfere with their eco­
nomic development. The treaty 
argues that the U.S., Europe, and 
Russia did not have restraints 
while developing; therefore cur­
rent developing countries should 
also not be confined to pollution . 
reduction.
In the U.S. itself, various pieces 
of legislation have appeared be­
fore Congress to prevent global 
warming, but few have passed. 
The most important was the
Alejo Grigera/Art Editor
Global warming is causing the Earth to heat as a result of the burning of 
fossil fuels and many industrial pollutants which release carbon dioxide.
Climate Stewardship and Inno­
vation Act, which would have 
created unprecedented limits on 
U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, 
jump-started investment in re­
newable energy, enacted a flex­
ible emissions program, and put 
aside funding to help adjusting 
wildlife. Although this failed in 
June 2005, the mere fact that the 
bill was proposed shows biparti­
san support for this critical issue.
The two largest insurance 
companies in the world, Munich 
Re and Swiss Re, have predicted 
that the U.S. will have to pay 
$150 billion a year for the next
decade to battle the international 
crisis global warming poses. The 
costs would be related to disaster 
relief and insurance.
There are a multitude of 
things that people can do to 
impede global warming. The 
most important thing is to use 
energy-efficient technology, 
such as hybrid cars, fluorescent 
(as opposed to incandescent) 
light bulbs, and “Energy Star” 
appliances. Investment in solar, 
wind, and renewable energy 
sources will decrease the burning 
of fossil fuels. Also check your ve­
hicles regularly and plant trees.
How Things Work: Diamonds
Radha Chitale
Millions of years ago, dia­
monds were formed about 161 
kilometers below the earth’s 
surface in a section known as 
the mantle. Only in the mantle 
are conditions intense enough 
to pressurize pure carbon into a 
gem. Diamonds are made when 
the pressure reaches 435,000 
pounds per square inch and 
the temperature is above 752°F. 
Anything below these figures re­
sults in graphite, a softer, flakier 
carbon composition.
The diamonds that we find 
today reached the Earth’s sur­
face by powerful magma erup-
Kristen Lukiewski/Pillbox Editor
tions through deep cracks. The 
eruptions formed pipes called 
Kimberlite pipes, after the first 
pipes found in Kimberley, South 
Africa. These are also known as 
diamond pipes. Diamond miners 
look for kimberlite, a bluish rock 
that resulted from the cooled 
magma, when looking for dia­
monds. However, diamonds can 
be found in other locations due 
to geological activity and glacier 
and water movement.
Though diamonds are valued 
for their beauty and rarity, they 
are, in fact, no rarer than any 
other gem or precious stone; 
diamonds are simply carbon. 
They are special because they
are composed of carbon in its 
most concentrated form, making 
it the hardest naturally found 
substance on earth.
Diamonds are hard because 
of their unique molecular struc­
ture. The carbon atoms in a 
diamond are closely packed in 
a crystal lattice arrangement of 
tetrahedrons, in which a central 
carbon atom is covalently linked 
to four surrounding carbon 
atoms. Though the thought of 
four linked objects calls to mind 
a square, a tetrahedron is actu­
ally triangular. This shape takes 
less energy to maintain than a 
square and is also sturdier. If you 
try to tie four balloons together, 
they do not naturally fit as a pla­
nar square — the balloons will 
rearrange themselves into a tri­
angular shape.
Diamonds are sturdy because 
of their atomic arrangement, 
but why are they also so hard 
and resilient? The answer lies 
in one of the smallest subatomic 
particles, electrons. Carbon at­
oms are surrounded by a total 
of six electrons. These electrons 
are arranged in three orbitals, 
the innermost orbital having 
two electrons, and the two out­
ermost orbitals having four, 
known as valence electrons. 
Carbon is short two electrons, 
which would fill the outer orbit­
als with unpaired electrons and 
create a stable octet. Eight elec­
trons is the maximum number of 
electrons that carbon’s valence 
shell can hold.
When carbon atoms come 
together in a diamond, they 
arrange themselves into a lat­
tice by forming covalent bonds 
in which they share unpaired 
electrons with adjacent atoms. 
Electrons that were whizzing 
around a single atom now travel 
and disperse their energy be­
tween two atoms. Each carbon 
atom in a diamond is, in effect, 
sharing its four valence elec­
trons in order to create a stable 
octet. The structure that results 
is very stable, giving diamonds 
their characteristic hardness.
Truly rare diamonds are those 
of pure carbon and are color­
less. Other rare diamonds are 
colored and can be yellow, red, 
orange, blue, green, brown, 
or black. Besides these, the 
“rarity” of diamonds has been 
engineered by diamond cartels 
that monopolize the mines and 
the market. For the past several 
decades, De Beers Consolidated 
Mines, Ltd., based in Johannes­
burg, South Africa and London, 
has maintained a firm grip on 
the diamond market.
Diamonds were not always so 
popular. Emeralds, rubies, opals, 
and pearls, among other gems, 
were equally valued and were 
used often as engagement or 
wedding rings because of their 
rich colors and exotic appear­
ances. The diamond market did 
not fare well during the Great 
Depression, particularly since 
antitrust laws in the U.S. forbid­
ding cartels prevented De Beers
from directly selling diamonds. 
However, a brilliant marketing 
campaign launched in 1938 by 
N. W. Ayer & Son re-imagined 
the diamond as a symbol of eter­
nity and love with their slogan 
“A diamond is forever.”
The campaign accomplished 
two things. First, it cast diamonds 
as the only jewels for special 
occasions, particularly engage­
ments, weddings, and anniver­
saries. Second, it encouraged 
women to keep their diamonds. 
This prevented competition 
from a secondary market of used 
diamonds and allowed retail­
ers to keep prices high. Indeed, 
the markup on a mounted dia­
mond is between 100 and 200 
percent.
Though there may be a dia­
mond monopoly on earth, 
there are also diamonds in 
the sky. Tiny but numerous 
diamonds have been found 
embedded in meteorites. Often 
the chemical makeup is the 
same. However, some of these 
extraterrestrial variants include 
xenon gas; this combination is 
not found on earth. Still others 
show a hexagonal atomic 
structure that is unlike the 
cubic structure of diamonds 
on earth. Scientists posit that 
these diamonds were formed 
during intense extraterrestrial 
impacts.
Next time you see a diamond, 
think about all the hard work 
and time that was put into 
making it!

UMD movies for PSP 
now on endangered

Only one year after Sony 
launched the PlayStation Porta­
ble (PSP) in the U.S., rumors are 
brewing that production of fea­
ture-length movies based on the 
PSP’s proprietary Universal Me­
dia Disc (UMD) format will come 
to a screeching halt. Since the 
launch of the PSP, sales of UMD 
movies have become almost in­

UMDs has already prompted two 
major movie studios to discon­
tinue their UMD movie releases 
and left others contemplating 
following suit. Adding to Sony’s 
troubles, some retailers are con­
sidering getting out of the UMD

IBM scientists create 
tool to build molec­
ular computers
Scientists at an IBM research 
center in Silicon Valley have cre­
ated a magnetism-manipulating 
tool suited to building molecular 
computers. The development is 
a step toward making comput­
ers based on the spin of electrons 
and atoms.
“We have a tool in place to de­
velop the product of the future,” 
said researcher Andreas Hein­
rich of IBM’s Almaden Research 
Center in San Jose, Calif. “We all 
know we can’t shrink the silicon- 
based technology used in today’s 
computers down to the atomic 
level. We have to look at a radi­
cally different concept, and that 
is what we are doing here.” The 
new method is called “spin-ex- 
citation spectroscopy” and uses 
a specially-designed microscope 
capable of creating magnetic 
fields as much as 140,000 times 
stronger than that of the Earth, 
scientists said.

Why some kids are 
smarter
The brains of more intelligent 
children develop in a character­
istic way, growing quickly over 
an extended period between the 
ages of five and 12. These findings 
resulted from a 15-year study 
done by the National Institute of 
Mental Health. The study used 
magnetic resonance imaging to 
get a detailed picture of how the 
brains of children change over 
time. It found that the cortex 
grew thicker and faster and its 
growth peaked later in kids who 
did better on standard IQ tests as 
compared to their average peers.
The findings could help scien­
tists pinpoint genes involved in 
brain development and IQ lev­
els. It could also give scientists 
a better picture of normal brain 
development and shed light on 
developmental and psychiatric 
diseases, such as attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder.

Role of
dopamine
clarified
DOPAMINE, from A6
The medicines or drugs used 
to cure mental disorders like 
Parkinson’s disease or schizo­
phrenia and addictions block 
all the dopamine secreted by 
the brain. However, dopamine 
is also important .for emotions 
and pain sensations. For this 
reason, people on medication 
for psychiatric reasons often 
appear to be detached and 
“zombie-like.”
The researchers attempted 
to study the mechanisms of the 
brain’s reward-signaling sys­
tem. Their experimental setup 
consisted of anesthetized rats, 
a model used to study what 
caused the neurons to go into 
burst mode.
What they found was a 
chemical responsible for 
signaling dopamine neurons 
to start firing. They found this 
“switch” in a particular area 
of the brain stem known as 
the laterodorsal tegmental 
nucleus. This area of the brain 
is regulated by the prefrontal 
cortex, which is also called the 
“planning” part of the brain. 
The researchers then found an 
indirect means to regulate the 
dopamine secreted by the brain. 
Thus, dopamine’s functions in 
normal routine and mental dis­
orders can be controlled.
“We have found the area of 
the brain that tells [dopamine 
neurons] to go into commu­
nication mode or not,” said 
Grace. “It could provide poten­
tial therapies for major mental 
disorders. We could develop 
drugs that control what the 
dopamine is doing.” Instead 
of merely blocking all the 
dopamine secreted and thus 
having significant personality 
side affects, researchers could 
alter when the dopamine is 
secreted to cure schizophre­
nia and other diseases while 
preserving dopamine for other 
critical brain functions.
This research is a break­
through in the understanding 
of neurological pathways.

This weekend marked the 
30th anniversary of the founding 
of Apple, a company known 
for the style and innovation 
of its products. Among these 
products is the Apple iPod, which 
revolutionized the music industry. 
In just a few short years, the iPod 
has redefined the portable music 
experience. Convenient for music 
lovers, this modern breakthrough 
in technology has garnered praise 
for its sleek design, compactness, 
and efficient song management. 
As a result of the boom of the 
iPod industry, many companies 
have chosen to capitalize on the 
iPod by providing accessories.
Released in late 2001, the 
iPod immediately attracted 
much attention. It exists today 
in three different models: the 
standard iPod, the iPod shuffle, 
and the newest addition, the 
iPod nano. They share many of 
the same physical features, and 
differ mainly in size. The iPod 
nano, however, differs in its flash 
memory and a substantially 
improved screen resolution. Each 
comes packaged with iTunes 
software that uses firmware 
flashing to interact with the 
device. This remains the only 
software endorsed by Apple. 
The most recent generations no 
longer provide a FireWire cable 
for connection purposes and 
instead use the more popular 
USB 2.0 standard. The amount 
of available drive space also 
separates these different types.
The popularity of the iPod 
opened the door to high sales
for many iPod accessories to 
improve the convenience and 
comfortability of the iPod. A wide 
variety of accessories are used for 
all sorts of purposes, from adding 
new capabilities to protecting 
iPods from damage.
An interesting accessory is 
the recent “shuffle beanie” 
from Pakatun, designed for 
the iPod. shuffle. This product 
attempts to resolve the 
arrangement of cords that has 
bothered runners and other iPod 
enthusiasts for quite some time. 
The beanie provides a convenient 
pocket to safely secure an' iPod 
shuffle while simultaneously 
keeping the wearer’s ears 
warm, and, most importantly, 
preventing disastrous tangles. 
Given the versatility of a 
pocket, rumors have speculated 
that other iPod models could 
be smuggled in this hidden 
compartment. The company 
touts their product as something 
revolutionary, and as providing a 
new type of freedom.
Another unique accessory is 
the specially designed iPod sock 
used to protect iPods. These 
flashy sleeves come in six bright 
colors. Besides making any 
’80s icon jealous, these socks 
offer adequate cushioning and 
protection of any version of the 
iPod.
Also available are the Iconz 
cases: These use elaborate
artwork to decoratre the entire 
face of an iPod. Some examples 
of the logos appearing on 
these cases include Superman, 
several baseball teams, and the 
Looney 'Hines’ Tasmanian Devil.
For those easily inspired 
by their iPod, the MicroMemo
digital voice recorder is the 
ultimate accessory. The device 
utilizes the iPod’s high-fidelity 
audio capabilities to record 
16-bit audio.
The MicroMemo features a 
microphone with a flexible neck 
that comes in handy for a variety 
of recording tasks. It connects
via the dock connector at the 
bottom of the iPod, and includes 
a built-in speaker for instant 
headphoneless playback. The 
device runs on the iPod’s battery.
Other accessories — including 
leather cases, integrated car 
components, and custom- 
designed speakers — exhibit how
much of an impact the iPod has 
made on society, and how many 
people won’t leave home without 
one. Though non are entirely 
necessary, each accessory 
demonstrates the popularity 
of the iPod. These unique 
accessories serve to enhance the 
iPod experience.

Need a boost? Rest is best
Energy drinks are everywhere on campus, but their overuse is unhealthy
Carnegie Mellon students need po­
tent fuel for their hard-working brains, 
but the recent upswing in the availabil­
ity and consumption of energy drinks 
such as Jolt, Full Throttle, Bawls, Rip 
It, Rockstar, and SoBe No Fear might be 
more harmful than beneficial. Students 
should strive for the energy of a health­
ful lifestyle fueled by balanced nutrition 
rather than depend on the temporary 
kick of sugary, hyper-caffeinated bever­
ages.
Caffeine has been around for centuries. 
Incans chewed coca leaves to keep their 
minds sharp during work hours. Many 
historians credit Europe’s tea consump­
tion with vastly increasing economic 
productivity during the industrial revo­
lution. In modern times, we have the 
ubiquitous Starbucks.
Caffeine works by blocking adenosine 
in the brain, a chemical which slows 
down nerve impulses and causes drowsi­
ness. It also increases the brain’s levels 
of dopamine, which causes a feeling of 
general well-being. In short, moderate 
consumption of caffeine is a useful and 
perfectly safe way to stay alert.
The problem is that the caffeine levels
in so-called “energy drinks” are hardly 
moderate, and many students consume 
energy drinks in excess. For instance, 
one can of Full Throttle (a Coca-Cola 
product) contains a hefty 142 milli­
grams of caffeine (more than four times 
the caffeine of Coca-Cola Classic), a 
pancreas-torturing 58 grams of sugar, 
and 200 useless calories. The nutritional 
content for other popular drinks such as 
Rockstar and Rip It is similar.
Many students consume more than 
one of these drinks per day, and those 
excess calories and sugars can wreak 
havoc on the body, causing weight gain, 
mood swings, headaches, and a decline 
in overall health. Interestingly, too much 
caffeine can decrease the duration and 
efficacy of sleep, which leads to fatigue 
and the need for — what else — more 
caffeine.
While poor decision-making is mostly 
to blame, Housing and Dining must 
accept some of the responsibility for this 
harmful habit. On the meal plan, soft 
drinks run like water, whereas juice, 
milk, and in some cases water itself are 
more difficult to come by.
By contrast, coffee, while high in caf­
feine, contains no calories. Adding two 
packets of granulated sugar boosts it 
to a negligible 32 calories. And recent 
studies have shown that regular coffee 
consumption can actually have health 
benefits. Harvard Medical School re­
ports that coffee is anti-carcinogenic, 
possibly lowering the risk of breast and 
colon cancer. It also helps ward off dia­
betes by increasing resting metabolism 
rates, and may even prevent Parkinson’s 
disease in men.
Bear in mind that while a healthier 
option, coffee is high in caffeine. Taken 
in excess, it can have all the same harm­
ful effects as energy drinks, such as 
disrupted sleep patterns and the jitters.
At Carnegie Mellon, we sometimes 
burn the midnight oil by dinnertime. 
And when eyes droop while deadlines 
approach, we need a little pick-me-up. 
When a boost is absolutely necessary, 
students should eschew syrupy energy 
drinks in favor of more traditional coffee 
or tea.
Remember, though: There will never 
be a substitute for the energy and pro­
ductivity afforded by a nutritious diet 
and adequate sleep.
Student government elections coming soon
This is your opportunity to make a difference on campus
Last Friday, one of our board members 
was enjoying the Pittsburgh sun outside 
when he was approached by a petitioner 
holding a clipboard and a pen. The peti­
tion? Add readme to the Senate ballot for 
this year’s upcoming elections. Now, as 
fine a publication as we’re sure readme 
is, the fact that adding Optimus Prime to 
the ballot isn’t enough of a joke anymore 
means student government elections are 
spiraling far out of hand.
April 24 and 25 are the dates of this 
year’s Student Senate and executive of­
fice elections, which will, among other 
things, place two new people in the 
positions of student body president and 
vice-president. For years these elections 
have been the object of ridicule among 
undergrads, as fictitious robot behe­
moths frequently garner more votes 
than some flesh-and-blood students. 
Last year, voter turnout was an “impres­
sive” 28 percent. With numbers like 
those, who needs apathy?
In reality, though, a student govern­
ment is only as good as the people who
make it. And that’s precisely why you 
should consider running.
We all have our niches to fill on this 
campus. But if you really want to change 
how our undergraduate population op­
erates on a very real level, there’s no 
greater challenge than to cut through 
the bureaucratic flapdoodle in which our 
student government has mired itself and 
infuse some efficiency and purpose into 
its bloodstream. If you consider yourself 
a leader, student government is simply 
one of the best places to make a differ­
ence in your four years.
You won’t be able to take it lightly, 
though. The issues our student govern­
ment deals with are no joke: the Joint 
Funding Committee, composed of Sena­
tors and Graduate Student Assembly 
representatives, doles out nearly a mil­
lion dollars every year to make up the 
budgets for every funded student orga­
nization on campus. And beyond that, 
Senate has the power to influence nearly 
every major decision on campus.
What we need are some movers and
shakers to get things kick-started again. 
And frankly, readme just doesn’t have 
enough charisma.
So how can you get involved, you ask? 
Filling out a petition is simple. Pick one 
up at the UC Info Desk, and if you’re 
gunning for a Senate seat, get 25 signa­
tures from students in your college. For 
an executive office, you’ll need 100, but 
even that is fewer students than in some 
lectures on campus.
Executive office petitions are due by 
April 10, and Senate petitions are due 
by April 14. Turn them back in to the UC 
Info Desk, and e-mail the elections board 
at (elections-board@stusen.org) if you 
have any questions in the meantime.
We’re looking forward to a solid elec­
tion season this year — it’s been too long 
since students have genuinely felt their 
Senate is a crucial part of campus. This 
year’s student government has made 
some important steps, but there is still 
much room to grow. We look to people 
like you to be a productive influence on 
student government.
Community appreciates 
constructive disagreement

On Wednesday, I received a message 
from my Lutheran Student Fellowship 
e-mail list promoting several events 
meant as alternatives to Sunday’s TBA 
showings. While I was at first somewhat 
amused — what is this, another out­
cry from the minority religious right?
— it dawned on me that the approach 
they’re taking is a bit different.
Last semester, during Pirates, the 
Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship 
(IVCF) had what they call an “outreach 
event.” This semester, their efforts were 
more extensive. IVCF joined forces with 
several other Christian groups Sunday 
to have a sexuality workshop, screen­
ings of Crash in the Connan Room, and 
a table with information about sexual­
ity for students in line to see TBA.
The advertising may have been a bit 
subversive; for the “alternative movie” 
event, in particular, it seems that 
they were more interested in promot­
ing their Dave & Andy’s sundaes than 
their moral outreach. The end result, 
though, was unintimidating: a very 
non-invasive banner soliciting open 
discussion about sex.
Consider also what these groups 
didn’t do. They didn’t stage a one-sided 
protest rally at the Fence. They didn’t 
enter the film, only to stand up and 
loudly disrupt the movie by shouting 
and heckling. They didn’t make and 
sign an empty “declaration of unity” 
against an “evil force.” They didn’t 
ask President Cohon to appoint an ad- 
hoc committee to investigate. Most 
importantly, they didn’t call KDKA in­
vestigative reporter Marty Griffin on 
the scene to write a sensationalist hack 
job so riddled with factual errors that 
he might as well have made it up.
No, they did something that seems 
to happen rarely — if ever — on this 
campus anymore: They engaged in ra­
tional discourse. They presented their 
own opinions in a highly available 
manner; they provided another reason 
and another means for students not to
consume pornography. They provided a 
present, clear voice for the part of cam­
pus that disapproves of pornography. 
For this, IVCF and. the other groups in­
volved are to be commended.
These groups may have been even 
more successful, though, had they taken 
a step back and decided what message 
they wanted to send. To portray the 
moral conflict as a purely Christian vs. 
non-Christian issue looks past a major­
ity of the potential audience. IVCF and 
the others could have reached many 
more people by carefully outlining the 
issues from a point of view of social 
mores and norms about sexuality in 
modern society. How many people sim­
ply ignored all of their attempts because 
God was attached to them? How many 
potential moral outreach opportunities 
were lost because of the chalk war un­
der the UC loggia between directions to 
TBA and “JESUS SAVES”?
The members of IVCF who created 
these events need to realize that Chris­
tian life does not need to be about trying 
to instill the Holy Spirit in every person 
walking the street. They should learn 
that only by their own example of living 
according to Christian values will oth­
ers get the message.
The only reason the Activities Board 
still shows pornography on campus is 
that students want to see it. It has taken 
the form of a fun, humorous event 
where people can relax for a few hours. 
Regardless of whether pornography is 
morally reprehensible and exploitative 
of women or just a good time for those 
watching and supportive of a free mar­
ket, those who inflame the debate will 
only make the opposing sides of the ar­
gument more jaded.
Abandoning the “this is how I feel, 
and you’re wrong” approach for a 
“here’s why I think this; what’s your 
take?” approach may, in the end, be the 
best way to move toward enrichment 
for all of us.
Jim Puls (jpuls@J believes it is not for 
him to judge whether or not pornography 
belongs on campus. He welcomes all re­
plies, especially those from Marty Griffin, 
investigative reporter.
LetterToTheEditor
Illuminating opportunities for men to get 
involved in gender issues
This letter is a response to Jackie 
Brook’s March 27 editorial, “Gender 
studies should include men.” As a male 
student involved in several gender 
issues initiatives, I feel Ms. Brook is 
misinformed about the programs avail­
able to students.
It seems that Ms. Brook does not 
have a clear understanding of the dif­
ference between gender studies and 
gender issues at Cairnegie Mellon. Gen­
der studies, an interdisciplinary minor 
in H&SS, is composed of a number of 
courses that focus on both men and 
women, all of which are open to both 
genders. Gender Issues, on the other 
hand, is a part of Student Affairs and 
includes programming focusing on is­
sues faced by both genders.
Ms. Brook’s editorial focuses on just 
one program run by the Gender Issues 
staff: the Women’s Leadership Pro­
gram. While this program is limited to 
women, there is an array of other op­
portunities available to men.
MOSAIC, Carnegie Mellon’s annual 
conference on gender issues, had many 
sessions that focused on both genders, 
including sessions on dating culture, 
gender roles in families across cultures, 
and historical government'propaganda 
focusing on masculinity. Several men
were on the conference planning com­
mittee, and some of the speakers at the 
conference were men.
The Gender Issues staff also runs the 
Sexual Assault Advisor program, an in­
tensive training program that educates 
participants on the prevention of sex­
ual assault and how to support assault 
victims. The program is open to men 
and women, and includes information 
about helping men who are survivors of 
sexual assault.
These are two of the many pro­
grams that Gender Issues provides. 
Throughout the year, there are lectures, 
discussions, book talks (the main char­
acter in this month’s book talk is male, 
by the way), and other programs that 
are not only open to men, but focus on 
both women and men.
Ms. Brook claims “there are no 
avenues on this campus for men to par­
ticipate in gender studies.” I strongly 
disagree with this statement and en­
courage all the women and men of 
Carnegie Mellon to attend a Gender Is­
sues event. I’m sure you’ll see that the 
programming is inclusive of all people.

THE TARTAN • APRIL 3, 2006Ag
Immigrants — legal or not — must not be marginalized
American citizens and illegal immigrants alike protest harsh new bill, effect revisions
Alexandra Kilduff
At a conference for community improve­
ment last week, I heard the impressive 
Congressman Danny K. Davis (D—111.) 
give the keynote address. In his deep, 
melodious voice, he recited some of the 
lines from Emma Lazarus’ famous poem, 
“The New Colossus”: “Give me your tired, 
your poor / Your huddled masses yearn­
ing to breathe free, / The wretched refuse 
of your teeming shore, / Send these, the 
homeless, tempest-tossed to me.”
The poem, written a century ago, was in­
tended as homage to the Statue of Liberty, 
which welcomed droves of immigrants 
coming in from the Old World. It struck 
me how ironic it was that Congressman 
Davis was uttering these lines at the same 
time many of his colleagues were literally 
three blocks away, deliberating over how 
to discourage newcomers from entering 
the country and how to punish some who 
had already arrived.
Immigration probably has not been 
such a hot political topic since the time of 
Emma Lazarus, when hundreds of thou­
sands of immigrants stepped on the shores 
of New York and San Francisco each day. 
Then, as now, they were looking for an es­
cape from their native homes’ poverty and 
persecution; and then, as now, those who 
considered themselves “truly” American 
were panicking over the various negative 
effects immigrants would have on the 
country’s economy, social hierarchy, and 
identity.
Today, of course, the argument is mainly 
focused on illegal immigration, which 
poses its own set of moral and political co­
nundrums. The Urban Institute and Pew 
Hispanic Center estimate that there are 
between 11 and 12 million illegal immi­
grants in the United States, and more are 
coming every day, defying border patrol, 
customs, walls, fences, water, “coyotes” 
(human smugglers), and possibly fatal de­
hydration in the desert.
These immigrants risk lives to come 
into a country where they will most likely 
be clustered into poor neighborhoods or 
rural migrant-worker barracks where they 
will take jobs sewing zippers into jeans 
for two cents apiece or picking cucumbers 
for a dollar a crate. This work, which pays 
poorly and offers few benefits, is strangely,
sadly vital to our economy, and makes 
these immigrants dangerous, dissident, 
and undesirable, according to some of the 
government officials who take their taxes. 
Yes, illegal immigrants still pay taxes
— and receive no government benefits in 
return. What’s wrong with this picture?
In the past week, the hotly contested 
immigration reform bill has raised the ire 
of conservatives, liberals, and many of the 
immigrants being considered in the bill’s 
proposals. It has also offered a unique look 
at the peculiar prejudices Americans still 
cling to, and it has also offered a glimpse 
of the sweeping changes this country is 
undergoing.
As far as prejudices go, xenophobia and 
racism have raised their ugly heads at 
the Capitol, poorly disguised as concerns 
for the economy and American workers. 
There may be some politicians who truly 
hold economic concerns, but consider the 
following remarks from Congressman Bob 
Beauprez (R-Colo.):
“My fear is that if we continue down this 
path that the Senate has established, that 
we will have created the biggest magnet 
ever. It would be like a dinner bell, ‘Come 
one, come all.’”
. And my personal favorite: Congressman 
Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) suggested 
that illegal immigrants would be effec­
tively discouraged from entering the 
country if we gave agricultural jobs to 
prisoners. “Let the prisoners pick the 
fruits,” Rohrabacher said. “We can do it 
without bringing in millions of foreign­
ers.” Yes, Mr. Rohrabacher, even criminals 
are better than those doggone freeload- 
ing foreigners, as long as the prisoners are 
corn-fed Americans. No sarcasm should 
be spared in responding to this man and 
his ill-informed comments.
Get a clue, gentlemen. When did Amer­
ica stop being the land of opportunity? 
When did we get the right to exclude im­
migrants when we ourselves are the direct 
descendants of them? And what are you 
going to do when recent immigrants be­
come America’s principal voting, block 
(which will be happening very soon)?
Representatives Beauprez and Rohra­
bacher and their supporters will probably 
tell you that we pay dearly for hosting our 
neighbors, whether it be through subur­
ban sprawl, overcrowding, or unfair com­
petition in the job market. But take a look 
at a day laborer who lines up on the street 
each morning hoping for work, who leads
an unstable and transient life as a migrant 
farm worker, or who sleeps in a crowded 
house of strangers, alone and far from 
his family. Stripped of most of his pos­
sessions, his dignity, and his rights, it be­
comes increasingly hard to argue that the 
more fortunate native-born are getting 
the short end of the stick.
Illegal immigrants are not parasites. 
They are men and women who are looking 
for a way out of poverty and repression, 
and they are willing to do anything for it. 
Many of them plan to make enough money 
to support their families and then return 
home; many of them wish to become citi­
zens with all the rights and duties that 
citizenship entails.
These people cannot be marginalized. 
The rather thrilling immigrant protests 
of the past two weeks have shown us that 
this is an increasingly diverse country— it 
is estimated that soon almost 50 percent 
of our country will be non-Anglo-Saxon, 
most of them foreign-born — with voices 
as powerful as anyone else’s. And they
Alejo Grigera/Art Editor
have power — real power — to shape and 
change policy. This is evidenced in their 
impact on the immigration bill, which had 
its more restrictive provisions (such as 
punishing immigrants already here and 
punishing those who assisted them) cur­
tailed at the last minute.
The power of people’s opinions and 
their effect on law and government is 
what makes the United States unique. In 
making their opinions heard, immigrants 
have proved that they are really and truly 
American, regardless of whether or not 
they’re tabulated on the national census. 
Let’s hope that those on Capitol Hill keep 
this in mind as they further shape immi­
gration policy, and ignore prejudice in 
favor of keeping the doors open for those 
who yearn to breathe free.

Mourning a word’s death: RIP literally’ (1533-2006)
Despite warning signs, overworked word dies of exhaustion at seasoned age of 473
Marshall Roy
My cherished brethren, I write today to 
announce and commemorate a tragic pass­
ing in the astonishingly large family of the 
English language. The loss of “literally” 
will be deeply mourned by all humani­
ties majors, linguists, and users of English 
(which includes you, grieving reader).
Perhaps deprived most by this untimely 
passing are whiny students who love to 
lament the tribulations of college life, 
waxing hyperbolic at every turn and ex­
hausting our poor word to death.
“Literally” was born in 1533, though 
many of us would not have recognized 
it back then. In its infancy, our dear de­
ceased friend was spelled literalye. Over 
time, its body grew and changed in many 
exciting but baffling ways. Its various 
spellings included litterallie and litt’rally 
before it settled permanently into its final 
form: a prepossessing four syllables with 
the darling parallelism of those three “l”s, 
capped off with a graceful “y.”
There was a time when “literally” was a 
rare and potent term. It was invoked only
to signal the gravest departure from meta­
phor or exaggeration. In 1839, Miss Mary 
Russell Mitford wrote in a letter that “at 
the last I was incapable of correcting the 
proofs, literally fainting on the ground.” In 
other words, she genuinely lost conscious­
ly, tear off his or her own head.
The young lady blundered in tagging 
an obviously figurative statement with 
the word “literally.” She could have quite 
correctly said “I will figuratively tear my 
head off,” or maybe “I will literally be up
That which we call a rose by any other name 
may smell as sweet, but that which we term a 
definition in any other usage reeks of idiocy.
ness and as a result fell down.
Presumably, Miss Mitford came to mo­
mentarily. The fate of the uncorrected 
proofs is ominously unknown.
Compare that to the unfortunate ut­
terance I overheard just last week, while 
strolling alongside Purnell. A young lady 
bewailed a looming assignment: “I can’t 
write this paper. If I don’t get an extension 
I will literally tear my head off.”
I daren’t impugn the stress this assign­
ment was causing the young lady, though I 
submit that a human being cannot, under 
any earthly circumstances or fits of audac-
all night writing it.” Unfortunately, she 
traded an irreplaceable piece of the word’s 
soul for a brief hyperbolic rush. Therein is 
poor “literally”’s ignominious epitaph. For 
shame.
Rarity is the essence of value. Words 
have power only so long as they are unique 
and memorable. Overuse is their destruc­
tion; overuse is the essence of cliche.
We were warned of the impending de­
mise of “literally” more than 80 years ago. 
Emilie Rose Macaulay pointed out the folly 
of the word’s misuse in 1922, when she 
was baffled by people who thought “that
‘literally’ bears the same meaning as ‘met­
aphorically’ (‘she was literally a mother to 
him,’ they will say).” Tragically, Macaulay 
was a linguistic Cassandra.
Let “literally” be counted a martyr in 
the struggle for proper English usage. Let 
it serve as sober warning to other over­
used words. “Random” is perilously close 
to becoming colloquially synonymous 
with “unexpected” or “unprecedented,” 
when in its heart it is “unsystematic.”
That which we call a rose by any other 
name may smell as sweet, but that which 
we term a definition in any other us­
age reeks of idiocy. English is a living 
language, and we should not resist its 
maturation. But its changes must always 
refine — never confuse or pollute.
We bid “literally” farewell, knowing 
that it has gone to a better place, to the 
great big dictionary in the sky.

Presidential
Perspectives
Let’s protest 
elimination of 
Perkins Loans
______
Tom Sabram
At a recent meeting with 
student govenment, interim 
dean Jennifer Church called 
my attention to a website for a 
grassroots campaign to try to 
save the Perkins Loans. When 
President Bush issued his pro­
posed budget for the fiscal year 
2007, he eliminated the line item 
for Perkins Loans.
This is a major concern for the 
Carnegie Mellon community. 
We have an endowment that 
is already smaller than many 
peer institutions like Princeton, 
Harvard, and Stanford, and that 
hampers the financial aid pack­
ages Carnegie Mellon is able to 
offer its students.
On average, somewhere be­
tween 20 and 25 percent of 
undergraduate students on 
campus receive Perkins Loans 
as a part of their financial aid 
packages. The average student 
who takes out a Perkins Loan 
receives about $3000. I spoke 
to Linda Anderson, the director 
of Student Financial Assistance 
and Services, and she believes 
students will be able to receive 
other loans to help compensate 
for the potential loss of Perkins 
Loans; however, those will be at 
higher interest rates.
I have only known about this 
for a few weeks, and during that 
time I have contemplated how 
the students should approach 
it. In the next few days you will 
see a campaign similar to the 
one student government initi­
ated around the PAT budget cuts 
last year. Expect to see an e-mail 
from your Senator or me detail­
ing how you can help. You will 
have the opportunity to write a 
letter to Pennsylvania’s Senators 
and representatives or, for those 
who don’t know what to say, to 
fill in a form letter, and student 
government will take care of 
mailing the letter. You’ll hear a 
little more about this next week.
Due to the unfortunate timing 
of the Perkins Loans cuts and 
student government elections, I 
feel I need to split this column 
to make everyone more aware of 
both. I encourage anyone who 
is interested or who would like 
to make a change on campus to 
run for student body president, 
student body vice-president for 
finance, or Student Senate. All 
you need to do is gather 100 
signatures from students for an 
executive position or 25 from 
students in your college for 
Senate.
These elections will be held 
April 24 and 25. If you are plan­
ning on running for student 
body president or Senate and 
have any questions, feel free to 
contact me. Good luck to all the 
candidates!
Tom Sabram (sbp@J is excited to 
see how the campus will respond 
to the elimination of Perkins 
Loans. Feel free to contact him via 
e-mail or at 412-657-3953.

Baseball season opens today

Staffwriter
In my opinion, this year is the 
Cubs’ year. This is their year to 
go all the way and win the World 
Series. I can feel it. Then again, 
I say that every year, and every 
year ends in disappointment 
— but that’s part of being a Cubs 
fan. It is part of the invisible pact 
one makes when placing faith in 
a team whose last World Series 
victory came in 1908. This, by 
the way, is the longest champion­
ship dry spell of any team in the 
MLB, NFL, NHL, or NBA.
Whether this will be a good 
year for the Cubs is still debat­
able, but this is certainly a good 
day for Major League Baseball. 
The defending World Series 
champions, the Chicago White 
Sox, opened the 2006 season 
last night when they hosted the 
Cleveland Indians, but the ma­
jority of the league’s games start 
today. With 13 games to watch, it 
is a good day indeed.
There are some intriguing 
things to keep an eye on during 
the 2006 season, starting with 
former Boston Red Sox out­
fielder Johnny Damon’s going 
over to the dark side to join the 
evil empire known as the New 
York Yankees and being forced to 
get a haircut in the process.
Barry Bonds, currently with 
708 career home runs, is only 
six home runs behind Babe Ruth 
and 47 behind all-time home run 
leader Hank Aaron. He is com­
ing off an injury-plagued 2005 
season, and to worsen things, he 
has to deal with allegations that 
he uses steroids, as published in 
Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance 
Williams’ Game of Shadows, a 
book detailing his extensive dop­
ing program.
In the American League (AL), 
the Chicago White Sox hope to 
repeat as AL Central champi­
ons; but the Cleveland Indians, 
who came close to making the 
playoffs last year, will try to de­
throne the defending champs. It 
will be interesting to see how the 
White Sox fare as they try to de­
fend their first World Series title 
since 1918.
Club Sports Roundup
Preparing for the shot, Tartan goalie Alex Schlichting protects his goal against an Ohio University player.
The Los Angeles Angels of 
Anaheim (yeah, that is their 
name now) and the Oakland A’s 
will both be banking on qual­
ity starting pitching and solid 
defense to carry them to a divi­
sion crown this season in the AL 
West.
The East figures to be another 
Yankees-Red Sox battle, with 
the two teams playing each 
other 19 times. The Toronto Blue 
Jays could challenge these pow­
erhouses with their addition of 
pitcher A.J. Burnett, closer B.J. 
Ryan, first baseman Lyle Over­
bay, third baseman Troy Glaus, 
and catcher Bengie Molina.
In the National League (NL), 
my Chicago Cubs compete in the 
Central Division with arguably
acquired veterans such as first 
baseman Sean Casey, outfielder 
Jeromy Burnitz, and third base­
man Joe Randa. These players 
hope to cure the Pirates’ problem 
— diagnosed as an inability to 
score runs — so their offense will 
be able to support their young 
pitching staff. Not one of Pitts­
burgh’s top four starting pitchers 
(Oliver Perez, Zach Duke, Paul 
Maholm, and Ian Snell) is older 
than 24. Talented relief pitcher 
Mike Gonzalez is the team’s new 
closer, despite having only four 
major-league saves in his career. 
Overall, the Pirates are very tal­
ented, but young, so Pirates fans 
should be patient with this team 
and trust that there is a light at 
the end of the tunnel.

Rowing Club
The Carnegie Mellon rowing 
club competed at the Murphy 
Cup in Philadelphia on March 
25.
The women’s team placed sec­
ond in the varsity lightweight 
race with a time of 8:19.93 and 
fourth in the novice lightweight 
race with a time of 8:41.18. The 
men placed fourth in the varsity 
pair race with a time of 8:26.42. 
The Tartans placed 11th overall 
out of 27 teams.
The team was back in Pitts­
burgh this weekend competing 
at the championship regatta for 
Division III club crew programs.
Baseball
The Carnegie Mellon baseball 
team played a three-game series 
against the University of Pitts­
burgh this past weekend, taking 
the first game 3-2 but falling 
short the next two games 1-2 
and 4-5 respectively.
In game one, first-year Ryan 
Woodring pitched six solid in­
nings for the Tartans for the win. 
Senior Matt Corbett, first-year 
Billy Ratliff, and sophomore Jim 
Stedman provided Carnegie Mel­
lon with its three runs.
The Tartans were defeated in 
the second game, 2-1. First-year 
Jon Coens pitched seven innings 
with six strike-outs and one 
walk. Carnegie Mellon’s solo run 
came with Woodring scoring off 
first-year Brian Tabata’s hit.
Game three turned out to be 
a heartbreaker for the Tartans, 
who gave up two unearned runs
late in the ninth inning to lose 
the game.
The Tartans are back in action 
Wednesday at Robert Morris Uni­
versity and Saturday and Sunday 
in a three-game series against 
Kent State University.
Men’s Lacrosse
Carnegie Mellon’s lacrosse 
team pulled out a 14-13 win 
against Grove City College last 
Wednesday night at the Tartans’ 
last home game of the regular 
season. The weather was ideal 
and the game was a nail-biter, 
with Carnegie Mellon pulling 
out the win during the last min­
utes of the fourth quarter.
Carnegie Mellon jumped out 
with an early 3-2 lead after the 
end of the first quarter but could 
not hold on to the advantage as 
Grove City came back and led 
6-4 at the end of the half. The 
Tartans’ dry spell resulted in only 
three shots and one goal during 
the second quarter. Carnegie 
Mellon was able to regain con­
trol of the play during the fourth 
quarter, score seven goals, and 
secure the come-from-behind 
victory.
Senior attacker Alex Knecht 
led the Tartans with an impres­
sive six goals and one assist. Ju­
niors Rick McMullen and Tomo 
Gibson and sophomore Zach 
Teeple each contributed a pair 
of goals. Sophomore midfielder 
Steven Blair added a goal and 
two assists. Junior midfielder 
Chris Denault added a solo goal, 
and senior midfielder Troy Cox 
added an assist to round out the 
Tartans’ offense.
Carnegie Mellon was back 
on the road on Saturday to play

sity of Pennslyvania. Although 
Carnegie Mellon lacked offen­
sive depth, with five players out 
of action for various health-re- 
lated reasons, the team was still 
able to handily beat Hope 14-1. 
Knecht again led the Tartan 
scoring with five goals. Knecht 
was followed by Cox, who had 
three goals of his own. Blair and 
junior midfielder Chris Broglie 
each had a pair of goals and a 
pair of assists. Teeple contrib­
uted two goals and an assist and 
Denault had two assists. Senior 
goaltender Pete Lafave had 10 
saves during the game.
Water Polo
This past Saturday and 
Sunday, the Carnegie Mellon 
water polo club hosted its annual 
spring invitational. Attended 
by the University of Pittsburgh, 
St. Mary’s College (Md.), West 
Point, Grove City College, Ohio 
University, Binghamton Uni­
versity, and the University of 
Toledo, each team played four 
games over the course of the two 
days. The Tartans fell to Toledo 
and Ohio University on Saturday 
but came back on Sunday to beat 
Binghamton and Grove City.
Carnegie Mellon’s top scorers 
were senior Daniel Sunday, who 
came away from the weekend 
with 12 goals, and graduate stu­
dent Eugene Natali, who had six 
goals. Six of Sunday’s goals were 
scored during the game against 
rival Grove City. Senior Dave 
Rozner had three goals during 
the weekend, while sophomore 
Matt Eager, seniors Arun Ghosh 
and Carl Neimeyer, and first- 
years Nik White and Kate Edgar 
each contributed one goal to the 
tournament totals.
the best team in baseball, the St. 
Louis Cardinals. With a brand- 
spanking-new stadium and the 
star power of Cy Young winner 
and starting pitcher Chris Car­
penter, not to mention reigning 
MVP first baseman Albert Pujols, 
the Cardinals look to be heading 
to another post-season.
The NL wildcard spot is up for 
grabs as well, as the NL East fig­
ures to have the Atlanta Braves, 
New York Mets, and Philadelphia 
Phillies all fighting for playoff 
spots. The NL West was not strong 
last year, but the Los Angeles 
Dodgers had a busy off-season 
acquiring infielders Rafael Fur- 
cal, Nomar Garciaparra, and Bill 
Mueller and outfielder Kenny 
Lofton while simultaneously 
changing their general manager 
and manager.
For those of you interested in 
the Pittsburgh Pirates, and only 
the Pirates, this season, things 
are on the upswing. The Pirates 
have a young team (and 13 
straight losing seasons), but they 
have a new manager and a new 
attitude. They increased their 
payroll in the off-season and
By my assessment, come Octo­
ber and baseball playoffs, expect 
to see the NL represented by the 
Braves, Cardinals, and Dodgers, 
and the Cubs sneaking in with 
the wildcard. The AL will wind 
up with the Yankees, White Sox, 
Athletics, and Red Sox mak­
ing the playoffs. The Cubs will 
throw out the Curse of the Billy 
Goat, win the National League 
pennant, and then go on to de­
feat the New York Yankees in the 
World Series, ending their 98- 
year championship drought.
The world will be turned up­
side down when this happens; 
there will be utter pandemonium 
in the streets of Chicago, and I 
will fly, drive, hitchhike, even 
scooter if I have to, my way over 
to the Windy City to be a part of 
it. After all, every Cubs fan (un­
less he’s over 98 years young) 
has futilely waited his entire 
life to see the Cubs win a World 
Series, so it wouldn’t be wise to 
miss out and bank on their win­
ning, say, three World Series in a 
row. Although, now that I start to 
think about it, it would be a lot 
cooler if they did.

Charter buses lining Forbes 
Avenue and an influx of athletes 
clad in spandex marked the Track 
and Field Western Pennsylvania 
Championship, hosted Saturday 
by Carnegie Mellon.
Athletes from 16 schools com­
peted in conditions that, while 
windy, were much better then 
last year’s meet, which was char­

The Tartan men’s tennis team 
fell short at the University of 
Mary Washington (Va.) this past 
weekend during a three-day tour­
nament. During the tournament, 
the 22nd-ranked Tartans faced 
seventh-ranked Mary Washing­
ton, 16th-ranked Swarthmore 
(Pa.), and unranked Rhodes Col­
lege (Ohio).
Carnegie Mellon kicked off the 
tournament against Mary Wash­
ington, suffering a setback as the 
Eagles swept the Tartans 9-0. 
The Tartans struggled to pick off 
a win, but the Eagles stood their 
ground, making the Tartans fin­
ish the day without forcing any 
matches to a three-game series.
The men faced Swarthmore 
next and again suffered defeat, 
losing 5-2 to the Garnets. Fol­
lowing the team’s loss they once 
again put up a formidable fight 
with the unranked Rhodes Col­
lege, hoping to get a win out 
of the weekend. The grueling 
matchup became a heartbreaker 
as Rhodes College edged past 
the Tartans 4-3.
A notable mention in the midst 
of a draining weekend goes to 
fifth singles Jordan Koslosky, 
who held his own throughout 
the weekend and had very solid 
matches despite the intimidating 
opposition.
Following a tough weekend, 
head coach Andy Girard showed 
an undeniable faith and confi­
dence in his players. “We knew 
this was going to be a big, tough
match up this weekend; it has 
been a really rough schedule for 
us, but we have continued to play 
hard. We’ve definitely had better 
weekends, and hopefully we will 
do well in the upcoming weeks.”
On the women’s end of the 
tennis spectrum, the Carnegie 
Mellon women’s spring dual sea­
son opened with a formidable 
matchup against the division 
one University of Pittsburgh last 
Wednesday. The women put on a 
strong performance but was not 
able to fend off the Pittsburgh 
Panthers, who handed the Tar­
tans a 7-2 defeat.
The first doubles team of Amy 
Staloch and Mona Iyer stepped 
up their play from behind at 3-4 
to win five of the next six games, 
securing an 8-5 victory. Iyer 
continued the momentum to be­
come the only Tartan to win in 
singles play. She finished strong 
with a 5-7, 6-2, 10-7 win over 
the Panthers’ number two sin­
gles player Leah Friedman. Fifth 
singles player Samantha Schultz 
managed to force the only other 
three-set match of the day, fin­
ishing 6-4, 4-6,11-9.
This was an important 
matchup for the 14th-ranked 
women’s team. Iyer and Staloch’s 
doubles win has proven that the 
Tartan women can match up 
against quality Division I teams.
Coach Girard said of their 
performance, “It’s great how we 
have two college teams in Pitts­
burgh playing together; [Iyer 
and Staloch] are probably the 
best match up this year, and 
have been very sharp and played 
efficiently.”
Varsity golf team has high hopes for season

The Carnegie Mellon golf team 
capped off a successful week of 
play with a record-setting victory 
at the McDaniel College Invita­
tional on Sunday, all the while 
keeping pace with the their goal 
of a first-ever appearance in the 
Division III national champion­
ship tournament.
Over the weekend, the team 
blew by the competition at the 
tournament held in Gettysburg, 
Pa., and finished at the top of the 
11-team field, 14 strokes ahead 
of their nearest competitor, 
Susquehanna (Pa.).
“It’s probably our biggest win 
ever. To shoot 599, that’s our 
best two-round score ever,” said 
coach Rich Erdelyi, who has 
guided the team for 20 years. 
“I’m really happy for them. They 
worked hard and they deserve 
it.”
Senior Matt Simone led the 
tournament after the first round 
on Saturday with a 72, despite 
tough wihds that made for diffi­
cult playing conditions. “We shot 
304 as a team [on Saturday], 
which is our best score of the

year,” said Simone, whose first- 
day eagle chip on the fourth hole 
highlighted his play.
Sophomore Howard Smith’s 
first-round eagle on the 18th hole 
also stood out. “It was straight 
downwind with water on both 
sides, so I hit two-iron, then four- 
iron to like two feet and kicked it 
right in.”
The Tartans followed up their 
season-best Saturday total with 
their lowest second-day round 
score ever, a 295 led by first-year 
Alex Timmons’s 72. Simone and 
senior A.J. Straub each shot 73 
on Sunday.
The team’s short game proved 
to be one of the main factors in 
the blowout victory. “Overall we 
putted pretty well today,” Straub 
said. “I know personally I didn’t 
have any three-putts and made 
everything inside of 15 feet.”
The Tartans’ productive week 
began last Monday with a col­
lective 315, nine strokes behind 
first-place Allegheny (Pa.), at the 
Titan Invitational in New Castle, 
Pa.
Timmons tied for second over­
all, firing a 76 on the wet par- 
72 course. “I thought he played 
intelligently,” Erdelyi said. “He 
played a very smart round of

Last week, Amy Staloch was 
named the University Athletic 
Association’s tennis athlete 
of the week. The honor was 
in response to Staloch’s out­
standing performance at the 
Fab Five Invitational hosted by 
Washington and Lee University.

Staloch came out of the tourna­
ment with a 2-1 record with 
wins against Williams (Mass.) 
College and Mary Washington 
University (Va.), placing her in 
the number-one spot in both sin­
gles and doubles. Recently, The 
Tartan spoke with Amy about 
her tennis accomplishments.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing tennis, and why?
Staloch: I started playing 
when I was three., My mom 
teaches tennis, and so I was 
always out at our tennis club 
anyway.
T: Did you always know that 
you wanted to play tennis in 
college?
S: I just played tennis for 
fun and for the competition. I 
didn’t .really ever think ahead 
as to what I wanted to do with 
it. College tennis just came up 
when coaches started contact­
ing me.
T: What is the hardest part 
about being a student athlete at 
Carnegie Mellon?
S: The hardest thing is miss­
ing stuff that goes on at school
golf. He went after pins he knew 
he could. He made a 25-foot putt 
that was a ‘no-brainer.’ I thought 
75, 76 was going to be a good 
score that day, and it was.”
“It was a par-three, number 
13 I think,” Timmons said of his 
lengthy putt. “Not many putts 
were dropping all day because 
the greens were wet and sloppy. I 
got up there and just knocked it in 
and it helped me out confidence- 
wise. It is hard to get confidence 
on those greens because you are 
missing one-footers, two-footers 
because you hit a bump and a 
kick. There is nothing you can do 
about it, so any confidence helps 
and dropping one that is outside 
20 feet helps.”
Simone and Smith each shot 
78 at Westminster, tying for 
seventh place while sophomore 
Blake Darby and Straub carded 
83 and 87, respectively. First- 
year Joshua Chen competed as 
an independent and fired an 85.
“I was pretty happy. I didn’t hit 
the ball particularly outstand­
ing, but everyone pretty much 
kept [the ball] in front of them, 
didn’t do anything too crazy, and 
we ended up having a good team 
score,” Simone said.
The Tartans’ stellar play has

when we are gone for tourna­
ments. We are really busy in the 
spring and miss a lot of weekend 
stuff.
T: What is the best part?
S: The best thing about being 
a student athlete is getting to 
know the team. We just have a 
lot of fun.
T: How do you prepare for a 
match?
S: I just do the team warm-up 
and hang out with the girls. I 
don’t really do anything special 
except try and be confident go­
ing on the court.
T: Where is your favorite place 
to compete and why?
S; My favorite place to com­
pete is anywhere outside, when 
it’s hot and my parents are 
watching.
T: What is your most mean­
ingful tennis accomplishment to 
date?
S: Winning nationals because

tournament and actually felt 
confident in myself.
kept them in the hunt for an ap­
pearance in the national Division
III men’s golf championships, a 
tournament in which Carnegie 
Mellon has never competed.
Following Monday’s third- 
place finish, the Tartans climbed 
to fifth in the Mid-Atlantic re­
gional rankings. At the end of 
the regular season, the top three 
teams from each region qualify 
for the 120-team national cham­
pionship tournament. After the 
first-place finish at Gettysburg, 
Erdelyi expects the Tartans to 
rise in the rankings.
“For a senior, [reaching the 
national tournament] would be 
the ultimate culmination of an 
athletic career at Carnegie Mel­
lon. We’ve never gone,” Simone 
said, “So to be the first team that 
would be able to accomplish that 
would be huge.”
The Tartans have four tourna­
ments in the next 15 days and 
hope to continue their strong 
play to secure a champion­
ship tournament berth. “This 
is great. We’re riding high right 
now,” Straub said. “Hopefully 
we can carry that into our match 
on Thursday and regionals this 
weekend and just keep the low 
scores coming.”
T: To what do you attribute 
your success in tennis?
S: I really think it’s just that I 
love to compete. I’d much rather 
play matches than practice.
T: How supportive is your 
family?
S: My parents are the best 
tennis parents I could imagine. 
They sit and watch me calmly 
and don’t care about the out­
come. They only care how my 
attitude is on court. They are 
disappointed when I get mad at 
myself, but they always comfort 
me anyway.
T: What is the best advice that 
a coach or teammate has given 
to you?
S: A coach once told me that 
the best win is to win ugly. It 
takes a lot of pressure off of 
“playing well” and focuses on 
simply competing with what I’ve 
got that day.
T: Do you like watching ten­
nis or just playing?
S: I’d much rather play tennis.
I like to watch my teammates 
but I don’t watch professional 
tennis.

What is that on my meal plan?
Carnegie Mellon kids try to stay healthy despite long hours and limited options
The folds of flimsy meat are flapping around each other, 
dripping in post-frying oil. The cheese is mysteriously 
bright in its artificial yellow color, and your bag of fries is 
slowly turning into a puddle of delicious greasiness. Sound 
familiar?
As we envelop ourselves in the madness that is the end 
of the second semester of the academic year, the tolls of 
extracurricular activities, excess homework, and extraneous 
stress are beginning to add up. Feeling lost in the masses 
of work and responsibility, it’s easy for students everywhere 
to turn to the one remaining comfort on a high-stress 
campus: food. Carnegie Mellon students, typically up 
late and overburdened with in-depth course material, 
comprise a unique social group with its own health-related 
characteristics. So, what is everyone at Carnegie Mellon 
eating? And when and where ai;e they eating it?
Many college students have started taking a closer look at 
what — and how — they eat. But what does the University 
do to keep the population of Carnegie Mellon healthy?
"Food is all about choices, 
and we provide a lot of 
choices 16 hours a day,” said 
Tim Michael, the director 
of Housing and • Dining 
Services. He explained that 
the "philosophical reason” 
behind the University having 
a meal plan for students is 
to “help create the social 
fabric of the school and 
help first-year students 
make a connection to the 
school," and “to help them 
be successful.” Fine. That 
is, in fact, what the dining 
facilities do — they bring people together, everyone eating 
the chips, packaged sushi, or waffles from Schatz.
But if Housing and Dining Services says that the dining 
options on campus unite the student body — and provide 
(or. aim to provide) healthy, “nutritious" food — then what do 
they say to people who have knowingly gained 10 pounds 
from the meal plan? “Eating is not just about availability,” 
Michael said, “it's about your personal approach.”
Carnegie Mellon students’ personal approaches to eating, 
though, may not be wholly personally determined. What 
happens when you’re up late, and obviously hungry?
“I normally get hungry around 12 or 1 o'clock in the morning, 
usually because I am up working," said Katie Bergman - 
Bock, a first-year policy and management student. Other 
students feel the same way, saying that they get hungry 
when they’re up late at night — then turn unhealthy snacks 
into a fourth, very unbalanced meal.
According to Carnegie Mellon Health Services, people 
are routinely eating instead of sleeping. “When your body 
is tired, your brain will say, 'Oh I’m tired, I must need 
something to eat,' ” explains Kristine Cecchetti, director of 
Health Services.
Beyond that, many people are agitated that the ‘O' is the 
only food venue open past midnight on a campus where 
students are notorious for staying up late. While Housing
and Dining Services says this is just a coincidence, as the 
hours of dining services are specific to the venue itself, the 
idea of very unhealthy food being advertised as a late-night 
binge does not bode well for the campus’s desired "healthy” 
image.
"I think it just encourages CMU students to eat greasy foods 
late at night. There should be another healthy option,” said 
Janice Weinberg, a first-year information systems student.
However, two new additions to the dining facilities on 
campus will come in the fall: a Carnegie Mellon Café in 
Resnik, and the Maggie Murph Café in Hunt Library. 
Michael boasts that these venues will maintain longer hours 
of availability.
So do we eat balanced-meals?
Probably not. Many students claim their favorite foods on 
campus include pasta, pizza, cereal, loaded sandwiches, 
fried foods, and Skibo subs. While everyone is, of course, 
entitled to indulging in such 
comforts, it can get out of 
control with the freedom that 
comes with college.
The meal plan system of 
blocks and DineX is one 
that is supposed to provide 
structure to our daily lives
— act as a nutritious 
intervention, per se.
“The block is a ‘value meal,’ ” 
said Michael. It is designed 
so that students “get a 
full, nutritious meal” for a 
supposedly lower price than if 
the items were bought separately.
However, as Weinberg said, “The meal blocks really screw 
me over because they include things I don’t even like and 
big portions ... [and] I don’t have a big appetite.” Other 
students have echoed the sentiments that the meal blocks 
are easy, but they often end up feeling like a waste of money.
The diets of Carnegie Mellon students on the meal plan are 
in fact dictated by its quality. Although Housing and Dining 
Services does now employ an in-house dietician, Paula 
Martin, many students agree that it is still difficult to stay 
healthy while simultaneously balancing a busy work load. If 
you are content with your Pepperazzi pizza or your Si Señor 
quesadilla, rest assured that many of your academic peers 
are on the same page. But, if you want to change it, you can 
do that, too. Go to bed earlier (yes, easier said than done), go 
to the salad bar, and just eat — healthily, contently, and fully.

...the idea of very unhealthy

Let your man out. Fuel to be fabulous. Get to it. Be

The beverage world is changing. Mega-corporations like 
PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have realized that energy sells, 
maybe even more so than sex. Energy drinks are the hot 
new bandwagon that everyone is scrambling to get aboard, 
and the options on the market are becoming so varied 
that the whole energy drink economy is on the verge of 
becoming saturated.
Energy drinks, regardless of their formulation, typically have 
a few things in common. They all have copious amounts of 
caffeine, along with herbal supplements like ginseng, taurine, 
and guarana, plus a spate of vitamins and minerals. The 
drinks are usually marketed toward the ever-lucrative 18-24 
demographic, promising them the extra energy they need 
to find the time for all the responsibilities and activities they 
involve themselves in. This marketing tactic makes energy 
drinks a prime choice for stressed-out college students and 
young professionals who are working more than 12 hours a 
day trying to make ends meet.
Take a walk to Entropy and on any given day you’ll see more 
than 10 different energy drinks on the shelves: Full Throttle, 
MDX, Tab Energy, NOS, Rip It, Adrenaline Rush, Bawls,
Vault, and Omega are just a few examples of this ever- 
expanding market segment. Most people try a few different 
brands and then choose one to stay loyal to. The beverage 
corporations see this behavior as the holy grail of marketing.
Energy drinks are popular because of the image they 
convey. They’ll give you that extra kick of energy you need 
to get through your bright-and-eariy 8:30 am Interp class, or 
help you pull an all-nighter to finish that killer programming 
assignment. However, energy drinks don’t really have 
, anything that good old coffee can’t get you. Starbucks 
coffee has more than three times as much caffeine per 
ounce as a Red Bull. All that energy drinks get you is a ton of 
chemicals and a lot of sugar, plus whatever beneficial effects 
the extra herbal supplements might have.
All that sugar, though, is the main strength of an energy 
drink. There are plenty of people who just don’t like coffee, 
and they much prefer the soft drink taste of products like Full 
Throttle or MDX. So, as bad as these energy drinks might be 
for you, for many people they’re a necessary — or at least 
desirable - evil.

Eating the right way: cheap, quick, and fried
Diners offer delicious alternatives to the meal plan
Were diners made for college students? Sometimes it seems 
like it. We don’t have any money; we get odd cravings 
" for things like maple syrup and cheeseburgers; and we're 
definitely not organized enough to make dinner reservations.
If you’ve had enough of the meal plan (or the trucks) and 
are desperate for an affordable, high-quality meal, don’t call 
Vocelli’s for the fifth time this week. The Tartan is here to 
help. Here's a list of five diners in Pittsburgh and what they 
have to offer.
Eat ’n Park: Eat ’n Park is the ultimate chain of Pittsburgh 
diners. It’s legendary: over 55 years old and located in 80 
places throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia.
But Eat ’n Park is most intimately connected to the city 
of Pittsburgh. It’s hard to say which is more true — that 
Pittsburgh loves Eat ’n Park or that Eat ’n Park loves 
Pittsburgh.
“Most of my high school friends who go to school far away 
say that they miss Eat ’n Park more than their parents,” said 
first-year Nicole Hallinen, a psychology and French major and 
Pittsburgh resident. The appeal is not limited to college-aged 
individuals; Eat ’n Park is primarily a family-style restaurant. 
The menu is entirely alcohol-free and many of its items 
are appropriate for children. When it comes to chains and 
smaller restaurants, Eat ’n Park is the best of both worlds.
It’s dependable and affordable, but it still has a cozy, friendly 
environment. Check out the one on Murray Avenue in Squirrel 
Hill if you want to put your DineXtra to good use.
Frank & Shirley’s: Some of the other diners in Pittsburgh 
are actually former Eat ’n Parks, including Frank & Shirley’s 
Restaurant. It’s a small space, which is at best a mixed 
blessing. You might enjoy having the place nearly to yourself,
but it comes at a price: bizarre hours (they close at 7 on 
weeknights, but are open 24/7 over the weekend), and 
frequent lines. Frank & Shirley’s is also hard to get to by bus. 
However, the place is known for its breakfasts and burgers, 
which are cheap and served quickly. It’s worth a try, so visit 
Saw Mill Run Boulevard in the South Hills.
Tom’s Diner: You'll also want to check out Tom’s Diner. 
There are three locations: one on the South Side (on East 
Carson Street), one in Homestead (on West Eighth Avenue), 
and one in Dormont (on West Liberty Avenue). They’re open 
24 hours a day, and the food is very Pittsburgh — almost all 
of it is fried. Tom’s also has something called a Gyro Omelet, 
which is a rather brilliant way of taking an ordinary breakfast 
and turning it Greek. The most exceptional part of Tom’s 
Diner is the service; there are a multitude of reviews praising 
the wait staff for their manner, speed, and near-flawlessness.
Pamela’s: When you think Pamela’s, you probably think of a 
line stretching outside of the restaurant and into the street.
It's loaded with Pittsburgh spirit. Earlier this year, Eat n Park’s 
black and yellow smiley-face cookies paled in comparison 
to Pamela’s Steelers-themed decor, which included strips 
of "Steelers fans only" caution tape across the front door 
and on the walls. And just as Pamela’s embodies the city of 
Pittsburgh, a Pamela’s breakfast embodies the weekend. “I 
don't consider it a weekend if Pamela’s brunch isn’t involved,” 
said first-year biology and psychology major Becky Ascher. 
Pamela's is known for having the best pancakes in Pittsburgh
— not only are they thin, but they can come stuffed with 
strawberries, apples, bananas, or blueberries. There are two 
locations on Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill and Oakland, a 
third in Shadyside on Walnut Street, and a fourth on 21st 
Street in the Strip District.
Ritter’s Diner Resturant: Ritter’s Diner Restaurant is an 
excellent choice if you’re interested in flashing back while you 
eat. Comfortable booths, ’70s-style decoration, and music via 
vinyl 45s contnbute to a soothing, classic atmosphere. They 
serve breakfast 24/7, and you’ll want to order a bagel breakfast 
sandwich, which is their most popular dish. They also serve 
feta cheese omelets and excellent deserts, including banana 
cream pie. Ritter's has an extremely loyal following and often
— like Pamela’s — has an extremely long line. Visit Ritter's on 
Baum Boulevard in Shadyside.
#
Whether you’re sipping an Eat 'n Park milkshake or enjoying 
French toast from Pamela’s, if you're at a diner in Pittsburgh, 
you’re probably having a good time.
“I think the thing about all of them is that they have 
Pittsburgh pride and they promote that 'hometown feeling,”’ 
said Hallinen. All five of the diners cater to every age group 
and have excellent menus you can depend on that include 
classy diner dishes like grilled cheese and breakfast foods. 
Most are open 24/7, so be sure to walk — or stumble — into 
any of them whenever you’re craving the diner experience.

Smoking or non-smoking state?
"Isn’t making a smoking section in a restaurant like making 
a peeing section in a swimming pool?"
George Carlin had a good point: Cigarettes and dining 
out are a bad combination. And, in light of the past few 
years, the world seems to be catching on. An increasing 
number of U.S. states and cities, in addition to other 
countries across the globe, are passing legislation banning 
smoking in public places, including bars and restaurants. 
Pennsylvania isn’t far behind. Not everyone is in favor of 
such a change in policy, but recent statistics concerning the 
possible economic and medical benefits practically speak 
for themselves.
Many stakeholders in the restaurant business are opposed 
to a statewide law against indoor smoking. “Every owner 
or operator should make his own decision, and customers 
can vote with their feet,” said restaurateur Kevin Joyce, as 
quoted in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. According to the 
Post-Gazette, approximately one-fourth of all Pennsylvania 
residents are smokers. Many restaurant owners are afraid 
that without a smoking section, they’ll lose a significant 
portion of their patronage.
However, data from places where it is already illegal 
to smoke indoors suggest that anti-smoking laws are 
actually good for business. In the year after New York City 
prohibited indoor smoking in 2003, bars and restaurants 
in the city experienced an 8.7 percent gain in profit!
Similarly positive results have been recorded in the cases 
of Delaware and California, “it’s fear of the unknown that 
makes restaurants think business will go down if they go 
smoke-free," said Greg Hartley of Smokefree Pennsylvania 
when interviewed in the Post-Gazette. “Will some 
businesses lose business? Probably. But most will not, and 
you don't make public policy decisions based on the least 
common denominator.”
When it comes to anti-smoking législation, the main issue 
is health. Employees of establishments that permit indoor 
smoking suffer significant risk due to the dangers of 
secondhand smoke inhalation. A University of California at 
Berkeley study determined that taking an eight-hour shift 
in a smoke-filled environment is equivalent to smoking 16 
cigarettes. And even employees in the non-smoking section 
are vulnerable: the same study reported such employees 
might as well be smoking 10 cigarettes with every shift.
According to an article in HealthDay, secondhand smoke 
can have debilitating effects on the circulatory system, 
including a heightened risk of heart attack and clotting.
A ban on indoor smoking could also prove salubrious 
to current smokers, since a smoke-filied environment is 
more likely to tempt a struggling quitter to light up another 
cigarette.
Pennsylvania lawmakers are starting to come around. The 
Post-Gazette quoted state Senator Jake Corman (R) as he 
described how opinion changed. “My initial reaction was 
that it was a marketplace issue, that businesses should 
have the freedom to cater to people who smoke,” he said. 
“But now i want to know more." At this rate, it might not be 
long before Pennsylvania becomes the next state to ban 
indoor smoking.

Java joints offer good joe
Local coffee shops offer a variety of atmospheres
Eating like it’s home. 
but at school...
Despite what the French say, I love my American sock.juice. 
Flavored? Sure, whatever, I’m no purist. Unsweetened with 
whole milk — cream, if you have it — too.
Coffee shops serve many functions. They're a place to meet 
friends, engage in lively intellectual conversations, read 
a textbook, write a poem. They’re a destination on those 
angsty days when I just need to get away. Cafés are my 
escape plan. I go, mostly, to trick 
myself into thinking I’m not 
doing work, but when I’m not 
people watching, I often am.
I mean, who can say no 
to free wireless Internet?
And, when this de-stress 
strategy fails, I’ll just quit 
school. I'll start a coffee 
shop of my own — a small, 
slow, struggling one with 
three tables and loyal regulars.
I’ll wipe the tables and read a 
book in the down times, basking 
in the smell of freshly ground 
beans and listening for the bell 
on the door to ring business.
Coffee shops provide a 
refuge for the hipsters, 
the writers, the readers, 
the caffeine addicts, 
and café connoisseurs. 
They’re a place to be 
alone, a place to catch 
up. Go there for a more 
enticing meeting, or apply 
for a job there; the pay's 
not great, but the people 
are friendly (except maybe 
at 8:05 am in the business 
district). And whether 
it’s Starbucks, Panera 
Bread, Caribou Coffee, the 
Coffee Tree Roasters, Crazy 
Mocha, or a locally owned 
venue, Pittsburgh’s coffee 
scene has a lot to offer for 
every taste and comfort 
level, if you know where to 
look.
¡¡¡¡Sill
61c: I like to walk to the 61c 
(located on Murray Avenue, 
in Squirrel Hill) on sunny Saturday
afternoons, because then it doesn’t seem like working. I get 
to kill five birds: It counts as exercise, gets me off campus, a 
chance to call my mom, a place to work, and gets me a hot 
mug of something for a perfectly reasonable price. And, for 
my tastes, their muffins are the best I’ve found. Granted, 
it’s a bit cramped; the dozens of little square tables are a 
little gridlocked, but the light from that huge front window 
is fantastic. There is outside seating when it’s warm 
enough, but I prefer to be inside anyway, because that soft 
electrónica they play is often new (to me) and always good.
Tango Cafe: Farther down Murray (on Forward Avenue) 
is the Tango Café, Pittsburgh’s Argentinian coffee house, 
offering a variety of teas and coffee drinks, tasty sandwiches, 
and Spanish classes almost every night. There are only seven 
tables, but on a Thursday afternoon, I am the only one there. 
From there I can catch either a 61C or 59U back to campus.
The Beehive: Go to the South Side’s Beehive if you wear 
•Converse sneakers, like disco balls, and paint in primary 
colors. The Beehive now boasts a smoking lounge 
and a quiet study room, but I prefer to be loud 
when I’m there. It’s a place for my friends and me 
on Friday nights, playing Jenga in large groups. 
Their game section has a lot of potential if you can 
find all the pieces. With Jenga it’s not a problem, and 
all the blocks have long since been individualized
— go ahead and call all those numbers “for a good 
time" if you want. The 54C will take you right 
back to Craig Street, where you’re faced with 
a choice:
Starbucks, or Kiva Han? I choose Kiva 
Han, usually, out of loyalty to the artists and 
musicians who exhibit there and because I 
love to while away the hours on their upper 
level while reading the philosophies 
expressed on the colorful walls of their 
bathroom. You have to love a 
place that recycles their 
cup sleeves, right?
Coffee Tree 
Roasters or 
Walnut Jitters:
If the Coffee 
Tree Roasters in 
Shadyside is full 
(or all the couches 
are taken), I walk a 
few more blocks down 
to Walnut Jitters, a tiny 
little place in the Shadyside 
Mall. I like their couch, their 
white-chocolate-flavored coffee, 
and the sight of young couples 
buying ice cream for their children 
while people peer in from the street. It’s 
small, intimate, and relaxing. They were 
playing Coldplay’s “Parachutes” last time I
Enrico’s Tazza D’Oro: I have to say my newest 
favorite is Enrico’s Tazza D’Oro, which is located on 
Highland Avenue in East Liberty. I like the little tables, the 
couches, the photographs on the walls, and the sense that 
when I go there I’m among real people, not just students. 
The music is mild, but far from elevator music — music 
like Aimee Mann. They are bringing Europe to Pittsburgh’s 
East End. They take great pride in the quality of their coffee, 
while providing a variety of soups and sandwiches. And 
I’m definitely going back for another cappuccino and that 
enormous brownie.

We all say we miss home, sure, but what we’re 
really missing is the home-cooked food — because 
every once in a while, the ‘O’ doesn’t cut it. And the 
workers aren’t that nice when you call them Mommy. 
Here’s a list of the top five things about dining at 
college that just can’t compare to home-cooked 
meals, and some of our imperfect solutions.
No dining table or dining table conversations. We
don’t know about you, but the fact that we have to 
eat dinner while worrying about spilling stuff onto our 
laptops is not fun. Crumbs in our beds? Like sand 
in your bathing suit — also not fun. Our substitute: 
Vacuum your room. Yeah, you heard us. Clean your 
floor. Here’s why: You can put out a blanket and have 
a picnic. Heck, make it a party and invite that cutie 
from down the hall.
Radioactive food. Microwaves are God’s gift to man. 
But once in a while, having to microwave everything 
for 1:30 gets annoying. Especially those times you 
find out that the plasticware you just used is not 
microwave-safe. Word to the wise: Check the label.
Plasticware. Plastic knives do not work. They 
don’t slice open bagels and are therefore pointless. 
However, having many real knives is sketchy. There 
is no happy medium. Sorry to disappoint, there is 
no solution to this problem. Except maybe a bagel 
guillotine.
Egregious amounts of ramen noodles and Easy 
Mac. I don’t care what Matt Fischer’s blog says.
“Pez and ramen soup” is disgusting. And Easy Mac 
tastes like cardboard. It’s not even a good source 
of calcium! The solution? Get your mom to mail you 
some of her fabulous lasagna. We wish.
Having to worry about meal blocks ending. This. 
Blows. We hate having to look at our watches, 
realize it’s 7:50 pm, and sprint to Skibo to get dinner 
before it’s time for the late-night meat block of 
doom. It sucks even more when you eat your lunch 
at 4 and can’t have dinner until 8. You could always 
try picketing Housing & Dining Services. Viva la 
revolución!
One day, we will be real grown-ups with real kitchens 
in real apartments. Some of you already are. We 
secretly hate you. However, no matter how old you 
get, you will always miss your mom’s (or your dad’s) 
cooking. And we’re sorry to break it to you, but you’ll 
never escape the power of your momma’s food. It 
almost makes a good defense for the 40-year-olds 
still living at their parents’ houses.
It’s always nice to remember that whenever you do 
manage to get yourself back home, your mom will 
be waiting there with open arms. And if you’re lucky, 
she’ll have chocolate chip cookies.

Eating disorders offer false sense of control
College-age students are most prone to food misconceptions
Eating disorders. They’re something you joke about, right? 
Like Derek and Hansel in Zoolandei, when Matilda breaks 
the news about her recovery from bulimia. But she’s right:
An eating disorder is a disease. And, in today’s America, an 
increasingly prevalent one. The National Eating Disorders 
Association (www.edap.org) estimates almost 10 million 
Americans currently suffer from some kind of eating disorder
— about three percent of the population.
At our age, the percentage is much higher, since eating 
disorders occur most commonly between the ages of 13 
and 25, according to Carnegie Mellon's Counseling and 
Psychological Services website. The ratio of women to men 
afflicted is 9:1. One-half percent of college-aged women have 
anorexia nervosa, five percent suffer from bulimia, and up to 
40 percent of those who are obese may be binge eaters.
Scary, right? It gets worse. Chief complaint of all boyfriends: 
Girls seeking assurance by asking if they look fat. Sure, it's 
cliched, but true; most women and many men are needlessly 
unhappy with their bodies. The fact is that eating disorders 
come in varying degrees and many forms. A person can 
have an emotional obsession while maintaining a healthy 
weight. Counseling Services provides a variety of educational 
brochures on the topic, all of which are also available online: 
They place eating issues on a continuum: with confidence 
about body shape and size and flexible eating at one end, 
then a preoccupation with eating and body shape and size, 
which can give way to distress about the topic and finally 
eating disorders.
The brochures say: “Eating disorders are emotional problems 
which manifest themselves through behavior related to food, 
weight, eating, and exercising. At the root of these symptoms 
are issues related to self-esteem, control, trust, and difficulty 
coping with life events."
Symptoms to look out for in yourself and others include:
Behavioral: Restricting calorie or food to feel more in 
control, eating episodes where you feel out of control, feeling 
compelled to exercise to compensate .for food eaten, self- 
induced vomiting, temporary fasting to compensate for 
food eaten, drug use to control eating or weight gain, rituals 
around food, frequently weighing yourself, and counting 
calories.
Emotional: Depressed mood, mood swings, irritability, guilt 
about eating, intense fear of fat, low self-esteem, eating when 
upset, emotional discomfort after eating, difficulty tolerating 
the feeling of being full, and shame about eating behaviors.
Psychological: Perfectionism, preoccupation with food, 
high need for structure, rigid eating schedule, alternating 
between being in control of eating and “letting go," difficulty 
concentrating, and a fluctuating body image.
Social: Frequently eating alone, eating in secret, avoiding 
frienc^, avoiding situations where food is involved, strained 
relationships due to food related issues, and difficulty being 
assertive.
Physical: Amenorrhea (menstruation has stopped), throat 
problems, frequent weight fluctuations, significant weight 
loss or gain, swollen glands, hair loss, puffy cheeks, broken 
blood vessels under eyes, fainting or dizziness, fatigue, 
unexplained tooth decay, and the development of fine hairs all 
over your body.
Having an eating disorder can be detrimental to a person's 
own emotional and physical health and, for that reason, can 
adversely affect all aspects of their life: school, relationships, 
work. It's mind-boggling: Why would we do this to ourselves?
What is it about food and our bodies and the way we look 
that is important enough for us to jeopardize so many other 
important aspects of our lives for them?
Eating disorders can be about looking really thin, or they can 
be about analyzing what you eat and micromanaging. It's an 
important issue at Carnegie Mellon, where most are under 
a lot of pressure and many are perfectionists to begin with. 
When everything else seems out of control (classes, grades, 
etc.), eating is one “small" thing that can be constrained to 
prevent feeling powerless over your life.
The National Eating Disorder Association says some 
psychological factors that contribute to eating disorders can 
be low self-esteem, feelings of inadequacy or lack of control in 
life, depression, anxiety, anger, or loneliness. Troubled family 
and personal relationships are among the interpersonal factors 
that can contribute to an eating problem, as are having 
difficulty expressing emotions and feelings, a history of being 
teased or ridiculed based on size and weight, or a history 
of physical or sexual abuse. Socially, we are all faced with 
cultural pressures that idealize thinness and create narrow, 
size-based definitions of beauty for men and women. For the 
most part, we, as a culture, superficially judge ourselves and 
others based on physical appearances.
So what do we do about it? Be attentive to your own needs, 
both emotional and physical; watch out for your friends; seek 
help if you need it (there’s no shame in that, it’s a courageous 
step); and try not to think about it. Probably the person who 
cares most about the way your body looks is you, because 
the rest of us are too busy worrying about ourselves. Eating 
should come naturally and be as enjoyable as it can be.

Noodles, soup, or other
Students’ creativity yield unique uses for ramen
When I was 12 years old, I had a great fear that they would 
stop making ramen noodles by the time I got to college. I 
considered stocking up on them, but my mom assured me 
that this would not happen. Ramen was one of my top after­
school snacks in middle school and high school. I found that 
one package was good for two people and two packages were 
usually good for three people. One of my friends introduced 
me to the concept of adding vegetables and egg to the 
noodles, which I found greatly enhanced my meal.
I did of course bring a 20-pack of ramen with me when I came 
to college, but to my surprise I still have about half of the box 
left.
Ramen will always have its place in college life. As Chris 
Custer, a student at Georgia Perimeter College, writes,
"It is a perplexing enigma how students ever managed to 
survive before the advent of these miraculous noodles, and 
their equally miraculous foil seasoning pouches. Whether 
the student is a young, insecure freshman right out of high 
school or a burly, beer-tested senior who is slogging his way 
through [his] last year of college, these divine packets are 
as essential to college life as a loud, ear-splitting stereo, an 
ice-cold, refreshing beer, or a weekly check from the student’s 
financially burdened parents. Ramen possesses several 
qualities that are extremely attractive to students: It’s cheap, 
it’s fast, and it doesn’t taste that bad. It’s also extremely 
versatile, and I’m not talking about the fact that you can eat it 
raw, cooked as noodles, or as a soup.”
The traditional ramen soup is a very popular way of eating 
noodles, but it can get a bit boring. Fortunately there are
several websites, such as "The Official Ramen Homepage”
(.http://mattfischer.com/ramen/index.php?cat=13), and 
books, such as 101 Things to do with Ramen by Toni Patrick, 
which are filled with new ways to spice up those noodles.
After looking up some recipes online, I found that eggs and 
vegetables were pretty basic compared to the inventive things 
that people have come up with. Recipes range from “Sweet 
and Spicy Coke Ramen” (yes, that is Coca-Cola) to “Sinful 
Breakfast Ramen” (with eggs and bacon) to "Hyperactive 
Candied Coco-Ramen” (with chocolate and whipped cream). 
Ramen has been combined with almost everything from Girl 
Scout cookies to chicken salad and jalapenos. It seems as 
though these noodles can find their way into any dish.
So where did ramen come from?
"Instant noodles” were invented in 1958 by Momofuku Ando, 
the founder and chairman of Nissin Foods. They were initially 
considered a luxury item sold for six times the price of other 
noodle in Japanese grocery stores. Momofuku’s ramen arrived 
on the east coast of the U.S. in 1972 as "Oodles of Noodles.” 
"Nissin Cup Noodles" came the next year in the convenient 
styrofoam cup, and soon hundreds of knock-offs arrived.
What is that block made of?
Some people think that each package of ramen contains one 
incredibly long noodle curled and coiled into a solid block. In 
his book, The Book of Ramen: Low Cost Gourmet Meals Using 
Instant Ramen Noodles, Ron Konzak took a package of ramen 
noodles, boiled it and carefully took it apart. He reports, “I 
found that the package contained 80 strands of eurly noodles
5/64 inch (2 mm) diameter that, when straightened out, _ 
measured approximately 16 inches (40 cm) in length. This 
would indicate that the noodle dough was extruded through 
80 nipples into continuous rows, and cut into uniform lengths. 
The 80 curly noodles, cut to length, were then folded over 
once before being dropped into a mold, lightly fried, dried, anc 
packaged with a flavor packet insert. Each package, when 
boiled, stretched out and laid end to end contains about 100 
linear feet of noodles."
What else is in a^ackage?
Well, there is a downside. Each flavor package contains about 
1560 mg of sodium (which is approximately 60 percent over 
the daily recommended amount). To remove the water and 
form them into blocks, the noodles are deep fried in palm oil, 
which contains about the most saturated fat there is. Then 
again,'the average Japanese person eats about 45 packages 
of ramen a year, and the Japanese manage to stay quite 
petite.
With all cautions aside, if eaten responsibly, ramen probably 
won’t hurt anyone. It seems that as long as ramen stays so 
cheap, it will remain a staple in the lives of many college 
students — an old salty friend who just wants to make them 
happy.

Princess Mononoke
Wednesday, April 5 
1012:30
Hayao Miyazaki’s masterpiece 
outclasses almost everything from 
our worn-out Disney. This animated 
film is about a young prince, cursed 
by a demon, who must find the 
legendary spirit of the forest to 
cleanse his wound. He is cast into 
a grand battle between man and 
nature that explores the implications 
of progress. I don’t want to make 
it sound too material, though, 
because you’ll find love and beauty 
in Princess Mononoke along with 
moral ambiguities and soul-probing 
questions. I can’t say anything 
about this film without mentioning 
Jo Hisaishi, who has provided an 
epic musical score that is absolutely 
perfect.
Man’s Castle/No 
Greater Glory
Thursday, April 6 
81012
Welcome to two relics of the ’30s! 
No Greater Glory shows some 
cool gang members who end up 
in a not-so-cool gang war started 
by a flag-stealing. It’s like capture 
the flag taken way too seriously.
All the depressing themes are 
here — suffering in youth, the 
pointlessness of war... you get the 
picture. If the KGB took their game 
this far, Wean and Doherty would 
be no more. Man's Castle is about 
love and shanty towns with random 
castles. It also has a guy who robs 
a toy store. I don’t care what your 
motivation is, you do not rob a toy 
store. That’s just evil.
The New World
Friday, April 7 
7:301012:30
Roger Ebert noted that the great 
thing about this new take on the old 
story is that the director, Terrence 
Malick, doesn’t tell this story with 
the modern mindset. Pocahontas 
and John Smith both play their 
parts with a sincere sense of 
discovery without knowledge of 
the coming tragedy. The tired “let’s 
learn the word for ‘lips’ so we can 
kiss” scene actually works. Telling 
the truth still matters, though. John 
Smith is not an idealized hero, and 
his relationship with Pocahontas is 
more complicated than usual star- 
crossed romance. Malick makes 
the cultural encounter authentic 
and, thank God, without Disney 
songs.
Casanova
Saturday, April 8 
81012
I’ll show you the Hollywood 
checklist: Attractive male — check. 
Hot female — double check. 
Decent script — oops, looks like 
the producers forgot this one. 
Casanova really was a man with 
some awesome adventures. (Roof- 
jumping to escape the Inquisition? 
No one expects that.) Somehow, 
though, this film gets the spirit 
wrong. The wit is lacking and the 
fun misses the mark. While the real 
man had a very unique character, 
Casanova just seems to blend 
into any other action flick with a 
romance tacked on.
Lock, Stock, and Two 
Smoking Barrels
Sunday, April 9 
.7:30 10 12:30
One episode of “Hitchcock 
Presents” pulled off the suspense 
of finger amputation and truly made 
it a scary threat, and these British 
filmmakers took the scare and 
made it a poker strategy. Lock, 
Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is 
about a man at the losing end of a 
rigged game of cards who has to 
pay his debt in one week or face a 
stumpy appendage. Illegal means 
being the best means to pay off 
something like that, the characters 
start a lot of surreal chaos where 
just about everything goes wrong. 
This is a whirlwind plot with some 
crazy turns, but the ending is good.

H&SS receives 
largest donation 
in its history
President Cohon charged in massive art heist
Intended to install art on Carnegie Mellon campus
Award-winning author and Carnegie Mel­
lon alumnus G.H. Davenport-Aldridge (H&SS 
’92) made a record donation to the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences (H&SS) last 
week: four new foam soap dispensers.
The gift, which will replace the soap dis­
pensers in three men’s bathrooms in Baker 
Hall, is the largest donation by an H&SS 
alum to the college since its creation in 1968. 
In recognition of the gift, the second-floor 
men’s restroom in Baker Hall will be renamed 
The G.H. Davenport-Aldridge Lavatory and 
Washroom for Male Patrons.
“After spending my undergraduate years 
in Baker bathrooms smoking clove cigarettes, 
this is the least I could do,” Davenport- 
Aldridge said in a telephone interview. 
“Those arrogant business [students] think 
they’ve got it so great because of that Tepper 
guy — well, now H&SS kids get the luxury of 
having their soap pre-lathered. Beat that.”
Davenport-Aldridge graduated from H&SS 
as John Walker, a student with a degree in 
creative writing and a minor in psychol­
ogy. His book Negative Plastic recently made 
The New York Times’ best-seller list, and his 
2005 collection of poetry, Irate Winter, was 
awarded the Judy Dietrich Book Award for 
Poetry About Angry Seasons.
Davenport-Aldridge attributes much of his 
writing success to his education at Carnegie 
Mellon. “Having a background in psychology 
really has shaped my writing,” he said. “I 
know how people think, you know? That’s 
why I can write under female names. Thanks 
to Carnegie Mellon, I know the female 
psyche.”
In the course of his writing career, 
Davenport-Aldridge has written under 10 
different pseudonyms, including Virgil Q. 
Appleton II, Fabian P. Dixon, Lacey Lee Hope, 
and Daffodil Barbara Keene.
“We are extremely grateful to [G.H.] for his 
generosity,” said Carnegie Mellon President 
Jared L. Cohon. “This gift will certainly 
help H&SS feel a part of the University as a 
whole and will lead the school toward more

Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon is escorted to his car past a barrage of media.
by J.T. Trollman
Punctual Editor
An international law enforcement collabora­
tion apprehended a key suspect in an art smug­
gling ring that has baffled top officials in Scot­
land, France, England, and the U.S. for the past 
10 years. This past Friday morning, Carnegie 
Mellon University President Jared L. Cohon 
was led forcefully from his office in Warner Hall 
by FBI officials in what is being heralded as the 
greatest coup against art smuggling since the 
Paraguayan National Fine Arts Museum heist 
in 2002.
Among the pieces found in the basement 
level of Warner was Francesco Goya’s “Portrait 
of the Duke of Wellington,” and a large sculp­
ture by Carnegie Mellon alumnus Jonathan 
Borofsky was found under a large blue tarpau­
lin. Several other pieces were found scattered 
and installed in various locations across the 
Carnegie Mellon campus.
Carnegie Mellon Provost Mark Kamlet said 
in a press conference that those pieces ón cam­
pus were all installed under the pretense that
they had been “donations.”
As Cohon was escorted away by three FBI 
officers — who refused to comment on the 
president’s situation — he is reported to have 
said he “would have gotten away with [the 
crime], too,” had it not been for a group of five 
plucky young first-years and their Great Dane. 
University officials have not released the names 
of the first-years, but remarked that the group 
was immediately fined for keeping a canine in 
Morewood E Tower following verification of 
Cohon’s remarks.
The stolen pieces also include a snowman­
shaped sculpture by Gary Hume; a 1999 un­
derground installation by Magdalena Jetelova 
on the Cut, which has been covered by a tent 
structure to disguise it following a 2004 police 
sting; and an enormous French-curve-shaped 
installation by artist Mel Bochner, which of­
ficials say took over six months for Cohon to 
acquire. Artists such as Bochner and Borofsky 
have expressed their gratitude toward the mul­
tinational task force in charge of Cohon’s con­
viction and capture.
“How my ‘Kraus Campo’ installation was ever 
stolen from my home, I may never fully know,”
Bochner told The Tartan on Sunday. “But it’s 
such a relief to have it back in my numbers gar­
den again.” The Kraus Campo now rests beside 
a collection of Bonsai trees with square roots.
Borofsky was also relieved. “I realize that 
President Cohon was trying to pass my ‘Walk­
ing to the Sky3 piece as a ‘trustee donation,’ but 
that’s ridiculous,” he said. “It’s been installed 
in other places, true, but it would have looked 
God-awful on Carnegie Mellon’s campus. I 
can’t imagine what he was thinking.”
Cohon has reportedly been involved in petty 
art crimes since the 1970s, but only began tack­
ling serious works since 1997, when he became 
Carnegie Mellon’s president. In August of 2003 
he went abroad to coordinate a robbery in 
Scotland’s Drumlanrig Castle, specifically tar­
geting Leonardo Da Vinci’s “Madonna with the 
Yarn-Winder.” He is rumored to have yelled, 
“I’ll show you the Da Vinci Effect, Scotland!” as 
he ran off with the painting.
Cohon was reportedly also a partner in the 
2000 Stockholm National Museum heist. The 
three paintings stolen were worth an estimated 
$30 million, $5 million of which FBI officials 
say went directly to Cohon.

Drive-by Assault
16 October 1995 a? 22:09
A CMU student was jogging east on Schen- 
ley Drive when he was struck in the back by a 
pumpkin thrown from a passing car. The stu­
dent immediately fell to the ground, and was 
unable to get a good description of the vehicle. 
The student refused medical attention.
Phone Harassment
30 October 1995 at 22:30
An officer took a report from a female 
student, who reported she had received an 
obscene phone call. The male caller said, 
“Hello, I just spilled something down the front 
of me.' Now it’s running all the way down 
my belly.” Then the caller started moaning. 
The student was advised to keep a log of any 
future calls and to contact Campus Police if 
they continue.
Criminal Mischief
17 November 1996 a|02:44
A complaint was made to an officer about an 
incident that occurred. While sitting in a room 
on the third floor of Donner Hall, an unknown 
person flung what seemed to be a potato into 
the window. No one was injured.
Used Condoms
19 March 1997 at 12:10
An officer was dispatched to the Pittsburgh 
Technology Center due to reports of used 
condoms sitting on the floor of the first-floor 
men’s room. The night custodian noticed them 
there originally and turned them over to her 
supervisor, who subsequently turned them 
over to the officer who arrived on the scene. 
After some discussion it was decided that the 
condoms should be placed in the trash can. 
The plan was then implemented.
Open Lewdness
30 September 2000
While patrolling the fraternities in uniform, 
Campus Police encountered a male who was 
in the process of unzipping his pants, appar­
ently intending to urinate facing an open area 
to the public. Campus Police stopped the actor 
before he could perform his lewd act. While 
campus was asking the actor for identification, 
the actor explained to the officers, “I wasn’t 
pissing. I was going to measure my penis.” The
officers explained to the actor that he was still 
performing a lewd act, and that he must zip up 
his zipper so they could finish thé citation pro­
cess. The actor told the officers they should be 
prepared to answer for their actions in a court 
of law as his father is a lawyer. Campus Police 
explained to the actor that the profession of 
the actor’s father was inconsequential.
Well-Being Check
21 April 2001. at 23:09
An RA on campus reported that one of his 
residents had been missing for approximately 
24 hours. The RA had made multiple attempts 
to contact the resident with negative results. 
Five officers responded to the dormitory and 
met with a representative from Student Life 
and the RA who had filed the report. All of 
the officers traveled to the student’s room 
and knocked, receiving no answer. The door 
was unlocked and an attempt to gain entry 
was made, but the door was barricaded from 
the inside. An officer was able to get a verbal 
response from the student inside the room. 
After removing the clothes dresser that had 
been blocking the door, the student permit­
ted the officer to enter the room. The student 
explained that he had a big project due for a 
computer science class and wanted to be left 
alone so that he. could complete the project 
on time. The student said that he was not on 
any type of medication and that he was not 
contemplating harming himself. The RA con­
firmed that the student in question did often 
spend long hours working on projects.

Carnegie Mellon University — a school that 
promotes its diverse student body — may not 
be as inclusive as it advertises.
The University appeared last night on local 
CBS affiliate KDKA in a special investigative 
report titled “Where are the pirates?” In the 
story, KDKA investigative reporter Marty Grif­
fin revealed the severe under-representation of 
buccaneers on the Carnegie Mellon campus.
“Only three, pirates are enrolled as students 
at Carnegie Mellon,” Griffin said in his report. 
“Three pirates who want desperately to feel 
like they belong, but who have been denied this 
right to fit in.”
In his investigation, Griffin cited the ratio
GIFT, from 1
hygienic practices. [G.H.] is one of our most 
outstanding H&SS alumni, and it is an honor 
to have him recognize the University in this 
extraordinary way.”
According to H&SS dean John Lehoczky, the 
gift will help the college retain and attract lead­
ing professors to its top-notch restroom facili­
ties, enhance the student experience, continue 
its tradition of hygiene innovation, and ad­
vance the school’s visibility.
“I thought about donating money to repair 
the Adamson Wing ever since a whole row 
of students fell down the stairs after their 
seats collapsed during my poetry reading,” 
Davenport-Aldridge said. “But the more I 
thought about it, the more I realized that I 
would be putting my own money in a wing 
named after someone else. That’s not cool. Let
of the average number of pirates who apply to 
Carnegie Mellon, compared with those who 
are admitted. For every four pirates who apply, 
approximately one is typically admitted.
According to director of admissions Michael 
Steidel, the applications of pirates to the Uni­
versity are treated like any other; they are 
anonymous during the selections period.
But as Griffin made clear, this is not always 
the case.
“The applications might be anonymous, but 
we can always pick them out by the language in 
their personal essay,” said William Elliott, vice- 
president of enrollment. “We hate pirates here 
in Warner Hall.”
Elliott referred to such Carnegie Mellon 
hopefuls as Cap’n Carlos Sagginsails, whose 
essay was titled “How Me Hook Helps.”

Davenport-Aldridge has been heralded in 
the publishing market as one of the leading 
modern authors. To write his famed book 
Tortured. Introspection: The Decaying Panorama, 
he spent four months living undercover in a 
writers’ clinic to investigate the secret lives of 
contemporary authors.
“He’s really an innovative author,” said cre­
ative writing professor Jim Daniels. “That’s 
what we teach here in the creative writing de­
partment — innovation.”
H&SS students and faculty are holding

for Male Patrons next Friday at 7:30 pm.

Bush: New mandatory summer camp for men 18-24
by Marshall Roy
Wombat Wrangler
With the United States’ military scattered 
across the globe and recruiters having diffi­
culty refilling the ranks, the Bush administra­
tion has come under accusations of planning to 
institute a new draft.
“That’s absolutely preposterous,” said Sec­
retary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld at a recent 
press conference. “People have had the impres­
sion lately that the United States is all about 
war, and that’s simply not true.”
Rumsfeld went on to describe the Bush ad­
ministration’s new “bold, fun plan” for improv­
ing the nation’s morale, which has been dogged 
recently by economic stress and the frustrating 
war on terror.
“We’ve cooked up something that we think 
will really make a difference,” Rumsfeld 
gleefully announced. “We’ve put together a 
government-sponsored summer camp that
will be mandatory for all American men from 
ages 18 to 24, which is the demographic that 
we have determined needs the relaxation the 
most.”
In a radio address late yesterday evening, 
President Bush lauded the new program. “I 
think this is a great opportunity for our nation’s 
young men to experience something new and 
learn some new skills.” Some of the activities 
being offered at “Camp Eagle Justice!” include 
cave exploration, spider-hole diving, and 
découpage.
Bush continued, “America is a team, and we 
can’t have anyone sitting on the bench.” He 
described certain team-building exercises the 
campers will participate in, which aim to im­
prove communication skills. “One really handy 
activity involves trying to build giant human 
pyramids out of intractable men,” the Presi­
dent said. “It teaches our guys problem-solving 
and communicatory skills.”
White House press secretary Scott McClel­
lan emphasized that Camp Eagle Justice! will
not cater solely to recreational interests. “It’s 
educational,” he said, fielding questions after 
Rumsfeld’s announcement. “It will give the 
men the opportunity to travel to exciting new 
landscapes and meet lots of diverse people.” 
McClellan also praised the mandatory camp 
for offering academic courses. “These men will 
return from camp with practical skills, such as 
levee building. Our levee-building program, in 
particular, is very fine.”
For more advanced campers, there are 
interdisciplinary science courses offered in 
the curriculum. McClellan explained one such 
innovative class: “We’re proud to have a special 
course that really spans the scientific borders
— it will be part biology and part engineering, 
called ‘Anatomy and Electricity.’ ”
“We’re offering math and physics courses as 
well,” said Bush. “We’ll be teaching these men 
how to understand projectory trajectiles, like, 
say, throwing a baseball, or artillery fire.”
But the most progressive feature of Camp 
Eagle Justice! is its completely undiscriminat-
ing admission process. The camp is mandatory 
for all men from ages 18 to 24, but “super spe­
cial privileges will be afforded to our minority 
and immigrant population,” said Bush, “who 
have historically missed out on all our Ameri­
can fun. They’ll be the first to enlist — I mean, 
enroll in the camp.” A new “border control” ini­
tiative names illegal aliens as “actual aliens, to 
be shot on site.”
And since members of the government typi­
cally receive more privileges and opportunities 
than their less wealthy or less prominent fel­
low citizens, a “Fairness Clause” in the man­
date disqualifies all members of Congress and 
their families from participation in Camp Eagle 
Justice!
President Bush defended the special clause 
that some are calling unfair. He claimed that “it 
was the right thing to do [to exempt Senators’ 
sons] — heck, it’s time somebody stood up to 
Congress and told them they can’t just act uni­
laterally and get what they want all of the time. 
That’s no way to run a government.”
President Cohon attempts to dig to China
by Marshall Roy
Loves big holes
Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon has 
recently begun his most audacious project yet: 
digging to China.
He began the dig outside of Warner Hall 
on the Cut last week, and so far has reached 
a depth of close to six feet. “This won’t be like 
when I started digging to China between Baker 
and Doherty,” Cohon asserted. “This time I’m 
really going to do it, and no one can stop me!” 
Wearing oven mitts in anticipation of the 
molten rock beneath the Earth’s crust, Cohon 
began digging with a spade and plastic bucket, 
but soon realized he needed heavy machinery. 
Cohon managed to convince a trustee to do­
nate the earth movers that are continuing the 
excavation.
“I had seen big diggers in my picture books 
and always thought they were really cool,” 
Cohon said. “I like that they are big and make 
grumble noises. But I never thought I would 
get to use one!”
President Cohon’s efforts have been praised 
by prominent campus members. Hilary Robin­
son, Dean of the College of Fine Arts, considers 
the dig a meaningful metaphor for life at Carn­
egie Mellon. “It’s really striking how this proj­
ect mirrors the college experience: an arduous, 
inexplicable quest toward Hell. Brilliant.” 
Sophomore art major Bob Jones agrees. 
“This is literally and without exaggeration the 
most important thing that has ever happened 
in the history of humanity. This will join the 
gift of fire, the invention of the wheel, and 
Bjork as one of civilization’s most astonishing 
triumphs.”
However, many students are more skeptical 
than Dean Robinson. “It’s completely asinine,”
said David Nessmann, a senior technical writ­
ing major. “Best case scenario, we’ll have a big 
ugly hole on the Cut,” he said. “Worst case sce­
nario is he’ll hit a gas pipe and blow himself 
up. I don’t understand how this is allowed to 
continue. I mean, this is just like last semes­
ter when he packed a sack lunch and tried to 
run away from CMU, but couldn’t make it past 
Craig Street.”
Cohon isn’t letting detractors slow him 
down. He explained, in between sips from a 
juice box, how useful the hole will be once he 
breaks ground in China. “People can use it to 
visit China. I just hope they are able to get used 
to being upside down, since China is on the 
other side of the world,” he said.
The project has even drawn attention from 
the federal government. President Bush 
was very interested in the dig, and made an 
unplanned visit to Pittsburgh to speak with 
Cohon in person about the endeavor. Campus 
media was barred from the private meeting due 
to terrorist suspects apparently masquerading 
as the student population, but Cohon offered 
several comments after Bush’s departure.
“He said it was a good project to do because 
China has such a massive population and is 
rapidly industrializing,” Cohon recounted. 
“He wanted to know if the hole would be 
big enough to fire a rocket through. I always 
thought outer space was up, but I guess you 
could get there from China, too.”
Marshall Roy/Like...way too much... I mean, he even takes pictures of them. That's pretty unhealthy.
Students eager to visit a foreign country take a sneak peek at the Cut’s great hole.
Discrimination
PIRATES, from 2
“His essay was absurd,” said Elliott, who 
read a portion of the essay on-air. ‘“Once me 
cell phone fell deep into Davy Jones’ locker. 
“Nobody flush!” I says. “I’ll go get me hook.’””
Griffin came across the idea to perform an 
investigative report on the subject after he 
was mauled by Hackin’ Izzy Grimm, one of the 
token pirates on campus, following an on-air 
investigation regarding pirates last semester.
In an unofficial statement, Jared L. Cohon, 
president of the University, dismissed the re­
port. “Avast, ye scum-ridden weevil-shaggers,” 
Cohon said in a telephone interview. “Cap’n 
Nigel Cohon’s gonna keel-haul your dinghy 
and grow barnacles ’pon ye starboard knacker 
if ye keep makin’ scalawag reports.”
Griffin, who claimed in an off-camera inter­
view to have had personal interest in the sub­
ject, aired a follow-up this afternoon.
“The University said that they will continue 
to deny pirates as long as they have control of 
admissions and as long as such blatant dis­
crimination is legal — and it is, for now,” said 
Griffin in his on-air report.
In the meantime, college for the three pi­
rates who attend Carnegie Mellon will be a 
challenge.
They have reported uncomfortable experi­
ences across campus when dealing with cer­
tain administrative and campuswide services. 
First-year Stumpy McSwiggins was offended 
during his visit to Health Services last week.
“I went into the buildin’ with me hook stuck 
in me [buttocks], and all they asked me was if
I be bleedin’ pregnant. Yarr, they be driving me 
nuts! ” McSwiggins said.
“Yarr! Blast me barnacles, lad,” said Lazy 
Eye Quiny, a junior in information systems and 
campus pirate. “These landlubbers just thinks 
piracy be stealin’ softwares.”

The architects hired to design the new Gates 
Center for Computer Science have completed 
their blueprints for the building and have sent 
them to key Carnegie Mellon officials for ap­
proval.
Mack Scogin, of the Atlanta-based 
architectural firm Scogin Cogin Banana-Fanna- 
Fo-Fogin, met with associate vice-provost for 
Campus Design and Facility Development 
Ralph Horgan late last week, when the plans 
for the Gates Center were officially unveiled.
“This will be a 21st-century building de­
signed in a modern style,” Scogin said. “At the 
same time, though, we are making sure to re­
member and honor our roots.”
Plans for the $88 million building, whose 
construction is being driven by a $20 million 
donation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foun­
dation, showcase a number of features inspired 
by the Microsoft chairman.
Red, green, blue, and yellow — solid tones 
taken from the classic Windows logo — will 
form the basis of the building’s color scheme. 
The main entrance, under the caption “De­
signed for Carnegie Mellon students and Win­
dows XP” on the building’s outer wall, will be 
characterized by a brick mosaic in the shape of 
a large Start button. This mosaic will be dupli­
cated on the inside by the exit so visitors willSee GATES, page 5 Shadow people check out the newly released rendering of the Gates Center’s interior.
also see it before leaving the building.
“Blue, of course, dominates,” said design 
team member Rex Blauwacht. “When this 
building’s complete, you’re going to see a lot 
of blue backgrounds with white text. There’s 
something so familiar about it, and we used 
that scheme in the informational signs through­
out the facility.”
Gates himself had a hand in the design of his 
namesake building.
“Melinda and I have put a bit of pocket 
change — I mean, a significant investment — 
into the computer science program at Carnegie 
Mellon,” he said. “We were excited to be so 
personally involved in brainwashing — I mean, 
bringing new technology — to current and fu­
ture students.”
The physical features of the Gates Center will 
make use of Microsoft’s famous user-interface 
design. Each fire door in the building will be 
equipped with a small text display that, when 
pressure is applied to the door or the knob is 
turned, will print the question “Are you sure 
you want to open this door?” Designers are 
hoping that this measure will cut down on the 
number of false alarms triggered by people in­
advertently opening fire exits.
Diners on the University meal plan will be 
able to use meal blocks or DineX at the Long­
horn Vista Café, tentatively planned for the

Razor preview: Gillette’s “Project Intensity”
by Franklin Williams
Man
With the release of the Gillette Fusion, Gil­
lette’s new five-blade shaving system and an­
swer to the Schick Quattro, the company has 
already begun to anticipate their response to 
Schick’s inevitable six-blade disposable;
The razor war has exploded over the past 
few years, with the major players constantly 
releasing new, more effective razors with 
more, increasingly durable blades. Gillette, 
frequently considered the leader of the pack, 
has decided that it is time to put an end to this 
blade-on-blade battle.
Proctor & Gamble CEO and director Alan 
Lafley announced in a small private meeting 
that Gillette would be releasing a new razor 
within the year, launching a pre-emptive 
strike on Schick’s six-blade.
“Today marks a new era for the razor indus­
try,” said Lafley. “I believe Gillette has reached 
a new plateau in razor technology and is cur-
rendy preparing its launch for the first quar­
ter of 2007.”
With Gillette, name is everything. 
Codenamed “Project Intensity,” Gillette’s 
new razor needs and warrants a dtle that can 
compete with the Mach 3 and the Fusion. “We 
went through a plethora of names, including 
‘Project Thunderblade,’ ‘Project X-TREME,’ 
and even things as out there as ‘Project 
Moose Head,’ but none of those titles had 
what we were looking for,” explained Lafley. 
And rightly so — “Project Intensity” says 
everything anyone could want to know about 
this razor.
For starters, the razor has 57 blades. Yes, 
that’s correct — 57. They’re everywhere, and 
for all different purposes. “We wanted to 
make a razor that could do it all,” Lafley said. 
“And, honestly? It does. We’ve got blades all 
over the place.” And do they ever.
The current model is as its name says: 
intense. Fourteen main blades, two close- 
shavers, six blades for your back, five for 
the lower abdomen, and a litany of others
line the shaver head. But those just weren’t 
enough. Twelve blades are found, carefully 
placed, running up and down the handle of 
the shaver.
“We realized we just couldn’t logically fit 
any more blades anywhere else,” Lafley said. 
“That’s when we came up with the idea. It 
was brilliant. What says intensity more than 
blades running down the handle? We’re not 
sure how to market this yet, but regardless of 
what we do, it’s going to be good.
“This razor marks the dawn of one of the 
most significant changes in one industry in 
history. We know that smart consumers will 
realize how large of a step this is and invest 
in Project Intensity.” And Gillette had better 
hope so — so far they’ve invested $2 billion 
developing their new shaver, in order to de­
sign a product that wouldn’t slice the face off 
the average individual.
What the final product will look like, no one 
can say. But we can be certain that this shaver 
will, in fact, change the face of shaving as we 
know it. Literally.

Scientologists come to CMU, promote Intelligent Design
Robert Kaminski/Feet of steel
Commodore Adamantium addresses students about the truths of Scientology.
by Marshall Roy
He may be writing about Scientologists, but you 
just know he’s still thinking about that big hole
Last week, Carnegie Mellon hosted one of the 
most important events in the ongoing debate 
over the overlapping roles of religion, science, 
and law in American public education. On 
Thursday, a representative from the Western 
Pennsylvania Church of Scientology presented 
the case for so-called “Intelligent Design” theo­
ries in McConomy Auditorium.
Ignited by controversy in Dover, Pa., the 
question of Intelligent Design and other “alter­
native theories” to evolution have polarized the 
nation. The goal of the lecture was to expose 
Carnegie Mellon, a renowned research univer­
sity, to Scientology’s views on the appearance 
of Homo sapiens.
Reginald Carlisle, known in the Sciento- 
logical community as “Commodore Alderon 
Adamantium,” began his endorsement of the 
theory of Intelligent Design with an etymologi­
cal analysis.
“Just think about the words,” he urged the 
audience of students, faculty, and administra­
tors. “The first two syllables of ‘Intelligent De­
sign’ are ‘Intel,’ which I’m sure you all know is 
the name of a prominent computer corpora­
tion. Coincidence?”
Adamantium elaborated, “Therein is our 
proof that not only is Intelligent Design com­
pletely sound, but that all our human technol­
ogy was also intelligently designed. But not by 
humans — by some extraterrestrial force. And 
only after five spunky Earth teenagers with di­
nosaur-themed powers defeat the Easter Bunny 
at Chinese checkers will humankind be able to 
read the holy golden plates whose invisibility 
has frustrated galactic scholars for eons.”
However, much of the audience was uncon­
vinced by Adamantium’s postulating. “I think 
it was a load of hooey,” said senior biomedical

Andrew Moore
Once in a while, we must stop and recognize 
those who are truly performing a service to our 
society: the idiots who guarantee the long-term 
survival of our species by removing themselves 
from the gene pool. The Scandal Issue would 
like to thank these individuals by presenting 
them with the first annual Carnegie Mellon 
Darwin Awards. Forget about Architect’s 
Leap and chem lab explosions; these folks 
have kicked the bucket in truly original, truly 
Carnegie Mellon ways.
Did you hear about that creative writing 
major who loved to mimic campus art? He was 
tired of spouting random numbers and having 
people dress him up in articles of clothing 
during orientation, so he was very excited when 
he heard about the new art being installed. So 
much so, in fact, that he was determined to
engineering major Shirley Grail. “His refuta­
tion of evolution was laughable. Come to think 
of it, I think his version of the Big Bang was just 
a re-telling of Blade Runner.”
Other students disagreed. Jonathan Herrick, 
a graduate student in robotics and a devout Sci­
entologist, was enthralled by the lecture. “You 
can’t ignore the connections,” he said. “Doc­
tor Spock planted the flux capacitor inside the 
monolith so that only Galadriel’s light-saber 
could free it and spark mankind’s creation. But 
mankind wasn’t ready for this truth until now, 
so Optimus Prime used a Neuralyzer to erase 
our memories. Duh.”
“I’m sensing a lot of negative energy in this
reach the sky before it did. He didn’t take into 
account, however, that even though 100 feet is 
a long distance, he’s not inanimate like his pole- 
climbing doppelgangers. In the end, however, 
he may have gotten his wish and ascended into 
the sky. Good thing he went before the TBA.
Our pole-climbing friend lost his life in the 
name of art, but Pittsburgh isn’t just known for 
its cultural sensitivities. Pittsburgh is a football 
town, and as such, the Great Steelers Oakland 
Riot of 2006 got a little... crazy. It doesn’t take 
a particularly intelligent person to realize that 
prancing about in a Colts jersey immediately 
after the Super Bowl may not be the best 
idea. Running down Forbes yelling “Fuck you, 
Roethlisberger!” didn’t make things any better 
for this foolish first-year. Rumor has it that 
the couch wasn’t the only thing burning on 
Morewood that night.
Stillers fans aren’t the only maniacs you 
don’t want to deal with. As one unlucky More- 
wood resident discovered, the Kiltie Band is
auditorium,” Adamantium said after hecklers 
interrupted his lecture. He then produced a 
manual egg-beater. “And my Z-meter confirms 
it: exactly 1.21 gigawatts of negative energy. I 
will not tolerate this ignominy. By Grabthar’s 
hammer, by the suns of Warvan — I shall be 
avenged!”
Adamantium then blew into a conch shell, 
summoning the Batmobile, in which he 
promptly sped away.
Isaac Hayes would like to announce his resigna­
tion from the Scandal Issue. His thetan issued a 
statement that read, “Isaac Hayes hates making 
fun of anything. And anything is Scientology.”
a bit frightening when provoked. Hours after 
heckling the band during one of its practices, 
allegedly grumbling that he didn’t care about 
the noise and just didn’t want men wear­
ing skirts, he was found dead in the UC turn­
around. When reached for comment, the band 
simply said, “They’re called ‘kilts.’”
Also worth mentioning is the tale of the un­
washed engineer who tried to build himself a 
robot girlfriend. Minor flaws in the coding re­
sulted in highly unusual characteristics, such 
as a World ofWarcraft addiction and homicidal 
tendencies. While living alone did turn out to 
be fatal, he got off lucky. The robot still didn’t 
play half as many mind games as real girls do.
While these masterminds are being com­
memorated for making the ultimate sacrifice 
for the good of our population, we also hope 
that these cautionary tales have hammered 
some common sense into that silly little head 
of yours. Stay out of trouble, CMU, and don’t 
say we didn’t warn you.
Gates Center 
previewed
GATES, from 4
six different registers, each offering slightly 
different food combinations. Scogin said, 
however, that a grand opening date has not 
yet been fixed.
“I’m sure our designers and contractors 
will have the café open within a reasonable 
time frame,” Scogin said. “The last café we 
designed had some usability and security 
issues, so I instructed my senior staff to re­
work a lot of the base plans.”
Situated on the building’s third floor, the 
250-seat Clippy Lecture Hall will become one 
of Carnegie Mellon’s largest classrooms. The 
lecture hall has already notified Scogin that 
it “looks like [he’s] planning a building” and 
has offered its assistance.
Influenced by Gates’s involvement, the de­
sign of the center’s technology will also pay 
tribute to Microsoft’s innovations, Scogin 
said.
Teaching spaces, for example, will be 
equipped with a newly designed Classroom 
Update function that can automatically 
upgrade the room with the latest styles of 
chairs, desks, and even whiteboard markers. 
Paired with this is the Genuine Classroom 
utility, which will help building managers 
keep a more accurate count of resources by 
ensuring that only office supplies obtained 
through legitimate channels can be used 
within the facility.
Now that the architectural blueprints are 
complete, final approval rests with Horgan’s 
Office of Campus Design and Facility Devel­
opment. Horgan said he would probably sign 
off on the plans by the end of the month, 
though he noted he had a few concerns.
“Security, naturally, will be an issue'here. 
I’ll need to check with Campus Police and Sy­
mantec to make sure Carnegie Mellon is up to 
the challege this building will provide,” Hor­
gan said. “I’m also worried about this project 
giving Microsoft a monopoly on new build­
ings on campus.”
Blauwacht said his team might be able to 
change the Gates'Center blueprints if legal 
issues arose because of the current design. 
“Short of splitting the building in two, we 
could always construct the thing minus wire­
less access points and without built-in A/V 
equipment,” he said.
The Microsoft chairman, however, had no 
problems with the current proposal.
“I’m very pleased with the fine job the peo­
ple at Scogin Cogin Banana-Fanna-Fo-Fogin 
have done,” Gates said, “and I’ll certainly be 
looking forward to the center’s completion. I 
only have one rule: No penguins or big cats 
will be allowed in the building.”

Yes, the Tartan’s April Fool’s issue is back. During our two year hiatus, 
we’ve decided to change a few things, most notably the name of this 
issue. The “Scandal Issue” is a name we used for the very first April 
Fool’s issue back in 1930, and hasn’t been used (perhaps for good 
reason) since 1933.
Remember, nothing in this issue is real (except C&I, and the SAF ad, 
and the names of writers, and the snark). A lot of it is based on real 
stuff, but don’t take any of it seriously. If you have any comments about 
the issue, feel free to write us: aprilfools@thetartan.org.
Sexism 2.0: Robo-sexism invades campus

April Fool’s Editors?

Though Carnegie Mellon is one of the 
country’s leading universities in the world of 
technology, we still lag behind the norm in other 
areas, such as gender equality. Maybe it’s no 
surprise that, as an academic institution with a 
60-40 male-to-female ratio, we have a problem 
respecting our women. But whatever the cause 
of our oppressive campus environment, there 
is no suitable excuse. Action must be taken — 
for the sake of the student body and our faculty 
and staff. Blatant Robot Sexism (BRS) can no 
longer be tolerated.
There are many gray areas in the realm of 
gender issues, but — as all Carnegie Mellon 
students can agree — numbers don’t lie. A leak 
in payroll revealed that the new male robocep- 
tionist is being paid a salary 25 percent higher 
than that of the previous/emaZe roboceptionist. 
It’s disturbing that robots, which are supposed 
to be symbolic of the progress of the 21st cen­
tury, are also obvious examples of the obsolete 
notions of gender relations that we maintain 
here at Carnegie Mellon.
The most culpable party here is the admin­
istration. Are they embodying the legacy of 
Carnegie Mellon? When Andrew Carnegie 
wrote his famous “My heart is in the work” let­
ter, could he have possibly envisioned that he 
was laying the groundwork for an academic 
institution that would discriminate against fe­
male robots? Andrew Carnegie never lived to 
see a robotic employee, and we should all be 
grateful to have that opportunity. Our admin­
istration is stuck in the past. I’m sure that if the 
new male roboceptionist had an actual body, 
and therefore the ability to move, he would be 
spending his lunch hour every day with mul­
titudes of other Carnegie Mellon employees, 
cracking sexist jokes in the bathroom.
But we cannot place all of the blame on the 
Carnegie Mellon higher-ups. There is a other 
obvious wrongdoers, and those are the media. 
Since before the advent of robots, Hollywood 
has been propagating BRS in the hearts and 
minds of Americans.
Consider the Jetsons. Who was portrayed in
a more flattering light? Rudy, George Jetson’s 
office assistant — or Rosie, the eternally faith­
ful robotic maid? Rosie was taken for granted 
by each and every one of the Jetson family 
members. Her lines were written to sound less 
sophisticated than those of Rudy, which gave 
the impression that she was only fit for domes­
tic service and not worthy of the workforce.
How do you think the character of Rosie 
influenced the generation of Americans that 
grew up with the Jetsons, some of whom are 
now in positions of authority at academic in­
stitutions across the country? TV shows like 
the Jetsons taught them to see female robotic 
employees as inherently inferior to their male 
counterparts.
And don’t think that Hollywood discrimina­
tion is limited to the “boob tube”: If anyone had 
actually seen Robots — that poorly executed 
wannabe-Pixar knockoff featuring Robin Wil­
liams — I’m sure that he or she would have 
been likewise brainwashed with more BRS. 
There has yet to be a Hollywood project that 
has fairly represented female robots.

Not many of you knew Valerie. Maybe you 
only came into the Newell-Simon Hall for 
Asiana. Maybe you were never able to find the 
elusive connecting hallway from the fourth 
floor of Wean. Maybe you never left the engi­
neering library. Maybe you never needed her 
help. But she was a beautiful robotic woman, 
who performed the duties of her job with un­
wavering integrity and devotion. She was pro­
grammed with high levels of poise and love­
liness that I would like to see in more CMU 
humans. She could not have done her work 
more perfectly, or gracefully, and for her re­
placement to receive a higher salary is a grave 
injustice. It’s BRS at work. If Valerie had a body, 
and therefore a bra, I would have advised her 
to burn it. I encourage all you female readers to 
torch yours in her name.
Editor’s note: It has since been learned thatValerie 
went on to be a robostripper in Los Angeles, and 
is now making double what she did at Carnegie 
Mellon. We will never forget her, and wish her the 
best of luck.

Xenu, former leader of the Galactic Con­
federacy that once included Earth and a 
junior H&SS major, has recently become 
a star of Carnegie Mellon’s tennis team. 
Xenu has made steady progress on the 
team since joining during his first year, 
all the more impressive considering Xenu 
was revived from 75 million years of stasis 
only five years ago, according to his coach 
L. Ron Johnson. “Xenu is one of our most 
improved players this season,” Johnson 
said. “He has a great career ahead of him, 
whether he decides to pursue the sport 
professionally or go back to being ruler of 
the Confederacy.”
One of Xenu’s signature moves lately 
has been what he calls his “thetan serve,” 
during which he disorients his opponent 
by instantaneously lowering their thetan 
levels. The player comes back to life just 
in time to realize that they just missed the 
serve. The players’ Operating Thetan Lev­
els (OTLs) have usually become affected
permanently, which has given the Carn­
egie Mellon’s team a hefty advantage this 
season. According to Johnson, the thetan 
levels of Duquesne, Franklin & Marshall, 
and Case Western’s teams have been nearly 
obliterated.
“Xenu has really saved our team this 
season,” said teammate Eddie Chin. “It’s 
a good thing he found his way out of that 
mountain fortress, or we would have been 
creamed this year!”
Xenu is optimistic about once again ob­
taining control of this sector of the galaxy. 
But for the time being, he’s focusing on the 
team and his studies of intellectual prop­
erty law. “We’ve got some really good guys 
here,” he said. “My OTL trick just lets their 
talents- shine through, really. They’re the 
ones who deserve the credit.”

Is Your Professor Using the Classroom as a Platform for Political 
Agendas? This Is a Violation of Your Academic Rights.
According to the American Association Of University Professors, the use of classrooms for political indoctrination is a vio­
lation of academic freedom.
The 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure declared: "Teachers are entitled to freedom in the class­
room in discussing their subject, but they should be careful not to introduce into their teaching controversial matter which 
has no relation to their subject." (This clause was reaffirmed in 1970.)
If you are not taking a course whose subject is the war in Iraq, your professor should not be making statements about the 
war in class. Or about George Bush, if the class is not on contemporary American presidents, presidential administrations 
or some similar subject.
We do not expect our doctors to impose their political opinions on us when we go to them for treatment. We should like­
wise not be assaulted by the political prejudices of professors when we pay them for an education.
If your professor is abusing his or her teaching privilege or is confused about the professional obligations of an educator 
please contact us.

Quidditch players 
bitch about Borofsky
by Pratima Neti
Doyou wantto die? I want some Wendy’s.
Quidditch players are incensed at the University’s 
plans to install Jonathan Borofsky’s “Walking to the 
Sky” in the middle of campus. The statue, a 100-foot- 
tall pole sticking out of the ground at a 75 degree 
angle with people walking on it, has caused uproar 
among non-Muggles around Carnegie Mellon.
“First, we live in Pittsburgh. The weather condi­
tions,, i.e. the same cloudy weather every day, have 
led to games where it takes months, even years, 
to find the Golden Snitch,” said team Beater and 
first-year computer science major Neville Longbot- 
tom, usually known as Dave Smith. “Now we have 
to deal with a four-story-tall statue invading our air 
space. It’s enough to make a person turn to the Dark 
Lord — I mean, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named — for 
guidance and help. After all, we all know that he’s 
omniscient — I mean, scarily powerful. Um, just out 
of curiosity, is this on the record? It is? Crap.” Long- 
bottom could not be reached for further comment.
Quidditch players at Carnegie Mellon thought, 
that the school was accepting of alternative sports. 
According to team seeker Larry Totter, a senior cre­
ative writing and drama major, “After all, it’s not like 
Buggy is a real sport, and CMU has supported it for 
decades. We thought we had gained full respectabil­
ity on campus when the robotics department started 
drawing up plans to develop a color-changing 
Snitch. Then the robotic cars took precedence over 
our Snitch. Those cars took precedence over our 
Precious. Must get our Precious. Must kill robotic car 
department. NO MORE RED TEAM! Um, I’m sorry, 
what were we talking about?”
Muggles around campus are equally enraged on 
behalf of the Quidditch team by the installation of 
the Borofsky statue. “No more Quidditch means no 
more watching Quidditch. Which means no more 
girls in tartan kilts flying in the air. Which means 
no more looking up the kilts of girls flying in the 
air. That’s not good. That’s bad!” responded Bubba, 
a fifth-year University Studies major. When asked 
what college Univeristy Studies was a part of, Bubba 
ran toward the Pitt campus. He was followed closely 
by a girl in a cape, who was overheard shouting, 
“You’re the reason Quidditch and capes don’t get any 
respect!” Bubba is currently in the hospital, recover­
ing from a testicle retrieval operation.
President Jared Cohon’s response to the uproar 
was simple and to the point: “We will have a forum 
on the fifth floor of Baker Hall on April 31 to discuss 
any opinions on this matter. Until then, students are 
advised to keep quiet on the situation. You never 
know what nasty surprises are in store for you if you 
don’t.” Coincidentally, Totter is now suffering from 
an out-of-season case of herpes.
Until the April 31 forum, the Quidditch team will 
continue to practice as it always has. And Quidditch 
at Carnegie Mellon will continue to wait for the day 
when it finally will be cool enough to get its own 
office on the third floor of the UC.

Skibo staff
Learns the basics of human compassion
A recent move by Housing and Dining 
services has surprised few and delighted 
many. Tim Michael, director of Housing and 
Dining services, has enrolled the entire Skibo 
staff in a program to help with a nearby 
Ronald McDonald House.
Some consider this to be a PR move by 
Michael, who has taken heat for allowing 
such disgruntled people to serve the students. 
This is "ridiculous,” said Michael, because 
the staff is "the nicest group of people I have 
ever hired to work in a coffeehouse at CMU 
called Skibo.” He didn’t sound convincing.
The charitable staff has really taken a liking 
to helping at the House. “Aw damn man, 
helping here is great," said staffer Skeeter 
McMahon, in between drags of his cigarette. 
"EIGHTY-NINE! ... I just love these kids.”
When asked his favorite activity to do with 
the children, he replied, "STRAWBERRY 
SMOOTHIE! NINETY-SIX!!”
“I think this group is really learning how to 
deal with people,” said Ronald McDonald 
House manager Juan Pablito. "When they 
came in here they were pretty mean, and I 
think some of them were hung over, but these 
sick kids, man... they don’t take shit.” He 
went on to describe a time when a sick child 
asked for a bread bowl on the block. “The staff 
member cursed the kid out, expecting him to 
be like the pansy college students. But this 
kid was dying, and had nothing left to lose.
He drop-kicked the Skibo guy right in the 
groin and promptly got a bread bowl on the 
block.” Wishing to remain anonymous, the 
staff member with the injured groin remarked,
“These kids are tougher than those inmates 
from the ‘0.’”
The Skibo staff has also worked on their 
appearance. “When I came in here and 
saw that the kids who were ort intravenous 
morphine 24/7 looked less cracked out than 
I did,” reminisced Brutus Mitchell, a female 
staff member, "I realized that I had to turn my 
appearance around.”
Not all members of the staff have taken the 
program to heart. "I still hate everyone," said 
Carl Rugstein, who takes special pleasure 
spitting in paninis. “I especially hate these 
rich-ass college student pricks who think 
I'm their slave away from home." The rest of 
the staff concurred that yes, they still hated 
college students, and that the dying children 
were harder to be mean to. "When a kid with 
smallpox asks me for a cup of water, I just 
have a real hard time telling him we’re out,” 
said Rugstein.

At the dedication ceremony of the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School, Andrew Carnegie was joined by President 
Arthur A. Hamerschlag and other school authorities, 
promoting the “women’s high prerogatives” that would be 
the School’s main ideals. Mrs. Hamerschlag was notably 
absent; according to her husband she had “some things to 
tidy up around the house.”
Sophomore Harriet Drinklage withdrew her candidacy 
in the Miss Carnegie Tech competition in disgrace. The 
previous week at the Soph Sock Hop at Hotel Webster 
Hall, Drinklage and her date, bricklaying major Eddie 
Fishmonger, were caught in a compromising position by 
one of the band musicians. The popular NBC recording 
group The Sal Lombardini Orchestra stopped playing at 
the sight of the unseemly display, and the night ended up a 
total failure. The hotel management was nearly ruined and 
was forced to remove the hotel’s luxurious Spanish Garden 
restaurant to save costs. Thus began Webster Hall’s long 
decline, which continues to this day.
WRCT was nearly shut down by broadcasting regulators 
for having played a song with the lyric “high.” President 
H. Guyford Stever, aghast, sent a letter to the campus 
community apologizing for the egregious error and-promised 
that a full investigation would follow into the content 
standards of the station. Unfortunately, most Carnegie 
Mellon students and faculty were too high to care.
Members of The Pitt News staged a daring break-in of 
The Tartan’s office and, using The Tartan’s equipment 
and misspelling its name, produced a fake issue of the 
newspaper. Apprehension of the “Tartan-gate” break-in 
suspects was impossible due to The Tartan’s immediate 
suspension.

Your decision to boycott Daylight Savings Time in its entirety will backfire 
when every single other person in your project group forgets to change 
their clocks, leaving you to finish the project alone. Way to go...
The Carnival Chair will reject your booth proposal themed around 1992 
Los Angeles, citing that, while it is technically another place and another 
time, it’s just a bad idea in general.
You will receive yet another homoerotic fortune in your fortune cookie, 
leading you to believe that all those extra free egg rolls were not simply 
an accident, and that the nice delivery boy really did try holding your 
hand when you gave him the tip.
As you test a buggy fueled purely by Vault Hybrid Energy Soda on the 
Cut, lightning will strike the Borofsky pole, sending you back in time to 
1960. You will immediately seek out Roy Hunt and tell him to redesign 
his library before it is built.
You will drop it like it's hot. Unfortunately, you will drop it because it is 
actually hot, and you will start a fire. The building will be evacuated.
You will receive 538 spam e-mails about a great new investment 
opportunity. The 539th will actually be from Steve Jobs about a great 
investment opportunity. You will consider changing your spam filter 
settings.
An eccentric German engineer will offer to un-pimp your auto, and will 
then drive it off a bridge into Panther Hollow screaming, “Representing 
Deutschland!”
Your ultimate April Fool’s prank will go horribly awry when, days later, 
you will find out that the poor hamster had been alive this whole time.
In a freak biology accident, you will be bitten by a radioactive spider, 
but instead of getting super-powers, you will just become very, very 
sick. Your attempts to sue Stan Lee and Marvel for false advertising will 
largely go unheard.
Your boredom in Interp will continue to grow until it collapses in on itself 
and forms a singularity, gradually destroying Baker Hall from the inside 
out.
You will finally be awarded the patent for McGriddles, but before you 
can collect your royalty payments, Grimace will pay you a visit. You will 
develop an irrational fear of milkshakes. The less you know, the better. 
No one stands up to Grimace.
You will try for weeks to get the phrase “psychotically enjoyable’’ to 
catch on in the mainstream, but it just doesn’t have the same ring as 
“crazy delicious.”
