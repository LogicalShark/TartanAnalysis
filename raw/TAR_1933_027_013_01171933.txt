Trial Board Finds 
Fraternity Guilty of 
Rushing Infraction
Section 12 of Rushing 
Rules Violated by 
Fraternity
THREE FACULTY MEN 
ACT ON TRIAL BOARD
Board Finds Fraternity 
Broke Spirit and Letter 
Of Regulations
The Trial Board or Uie Interfra­
ternity Council, created to render 
decisions on infractions of rushing 
rules, met Saturday morning in the 
“Y” clubroom to preside over the 
case of Phi Kappa fraternity versus 
Delta Upsilon fraternity. Delta 
Upsilon was found guilty of violat­
ing Section 12 of the rushing rules. 
This section states that there 
should be no communication be­
tween rushee and fraternity from 
1:00 o’clock Sunday morning, De­
cember 11, until 8:30 Monday morn­
ing, December 12.
At one end of the long table of 
the stuffy clubroom sat the Trial 
Board, composed of three faculty 
members and three Council repre­
sentatives, at the other end sat 
the president, James Stahl, while 
the members of the Council were 
closely grouped around the table. 
Professor Leighou, chairman of the 
Board, called on John Boyle, Phi 
Kappa’s representative, to state 
the charge.
Boyle declared that a pledge pin 
was taken to the rushee in ques­
tion, Charles Belanger, -who was 
lying ill in the infirmary, by the 
Delta Upsilon fraternity Sunday 
morning in violation of the regula­
tions. He then presented a letter 
from Mrs. I-I. K. Kirk-Patrick, 
head of the infirmary, which stated

Student Govt. 
Methods Are 
Demonstrated
Revised Constitutions 
For Representation 
Arouse Debates
The members of the Executive 
Board of Carnegie were given 
a demonstration of the mechanics 
of Carnegie’s government at 
meeting of Student Council last 
Tuesday, which they attended.
The constitutions of student gov­
ernment in the four colleges have 
been revised and rewritten and will 
be acted upon in their new form by 
Student Council in the near future. 
The new constitutions for Margar­
et Morrison College and College of 
Fine Arts have already been sub­
mitted, but the question of student 
representation is still being debat­
ed in the constitutions of the col­
leges of Engineering and Indus­
tries. Final action on these con­
stitutions depend on the settlement 
by the Executive Board of the fu­
ture status of these colleges.
Josef Lentz, president of Stu­
dent Council, gave a report at the 
last meeting of the conference of 
the National Student Federation of 
America, which he attended last 
month in New Orleans.
Fifteen Students 
Are Admitted 
To Tau Beta Pi
Initiation of 15 pledges to the 
Carnegie chapter of Tau Beta Pi, 
national engineering honorary, was 
held at 5 o’clock Saturday, January 
7, in the fnculty club room, fol­
lowed by a banquet in the faculty 
dining room of Carnegie Inn. The 
group initiated consisted of three 
juniors and twelve seniors.
Prof. W. C. L. Trinks, head of 
the Department of Mechanical En­
gineering, was toastmaster of the 
banquet, and F. J. Chesterman, 
vice president of the Bell Tele­
phone Company for the Pittsburgh 
district, was the principal speaker. 
Mr. Chesterman in his talk dis­
cussed tho probable future of en­
gineering and gave some outlook 
into the 'future of college gradu­
ates. One of the features of the 
banquet was the presentation of 
a man’s travelling case to John E. 
Sayles, who had written the best 
pledge theme. Among the former 
members and guests present were 
Doctors J. H. James, W. R. Work, 
and C. Watkins; Professors, A. H. 
Blaisdell and H. S. Hower; and 
Messers, L. C. Flowers, T. C. 
Hower, J. C. Kohl, and G. B. Thorp.

Series of Talks 
Given at Trinity 
By Faculty Men
Allan Bright, Registrar of Car­
negie, inaugurated on New Year’s 
night a series of Sunday evening 
addresses being given by various 
members of the Carnegie faculty 
at the Trinity Cathedral during 
the month of January. These ad­
dresses, the first of which was Mr. 
Bright’s discussion of ‘Who Should 
Go to College,” are features of the 
regular Sunday evening services 
of the cathedral.
Dean Moor has been inviting as 
guest speakers ministers from 
other churches as well as profes­
sors from the universities, in order 
to make the services of community 
interest.
On Sunday, January S, Professor 
Gustafson, head of the Printing 
Department, spoke on “The Print­
ing Press and the Church.” Dr. 
Mylrea, professor in the Depart­
ment of Economics, discussed, oi 
Sunday, January 15, “Carillons.1
This Sunday, January 22, Dr. 
Schoen, head of the Department of 
Psychology, will speak on “Science 
and the Spirit of Religion.” He 
will speak in defense of science 
against its • mystification in the 
name of physics by Eddington, 
Jeans, and Millikan. To quote Dr. 
Schoen:
Science and religion have never 
been in conflict. The conflict has 
been between religion and science 
versus theology, which is a corrup­
tion of both science, and religion. 
Whatever is anti-scientific is also 
anti-religious, for, as history at­
tests, it is science that has been 
promoting the hope of religion for 
a kingdom of God on earth.”
Scholarships Available 
At Employment Office
The Employment Bureau has no­
tices of scholarships and fellow­
ships from schools located through­
out the country. Carnegie seniors 
are urged to try for this graduate 
work.
Information can be secured from 
the Bureau and will be published 
in the next issue of the Tartan.
Holmes Reveals Strange Cremation 
Rites of Bali Before Large Assembly
Burton Holmes’ illustrated lec­
ture on the island of Bali—“The 
Last Paradise,” provided one of 
the most entertaining and well-at­
tended student assemblies that 
have been held in the Music Hall 
this year.
Mr. Holmes' screen story about 
this most beautiful of Dutch West 
Indian islands revealed some of 
the picturesque and decidedly “un­
civilized” habits and ceremonies 
of tho olive-skinned Balinese. 
Among these habits is the slow, in­
spired method of carving. Tho 
workers do not speed up their work 
at the sight of an extra tip—they 
work because they love their ma­
terials and the objects they make. 
As Mr. Holmes expressed it, “The 
people have the real philosophy of 
living; they take their time.” 
"Every self-respecting Balinese 
owns two or three or four fighting 
cocks,” said Mr. Holmes, and his 
pictures revealed the sort of cock 
fights to be witnessed in Bali. The 
Hies themselves are not so typic-
By MARGARET GRIFFIN
ally Balinese, however, as the 
equipages for conveyng. the cocks 
to and from their places of abode. 
Large cave-lilce baskets, one at 
each end of a long, thin pole, are 
used to carry the fighting cocks 
to and from the pit.
“The women,” explained Mr. 
Holmes, “are not beautiful, ac­
cording to our standards, but fine 
looking—something honest in their 
faces. Their figures are fine.” 
And later on in the reel tho pho­
tographer gave a clue to the beau­
ty treatment of tho Balinese 
maidens. The women were shown 
carrying; on their heads high tow 
ers of cocoanut husks, which they 
sell for'the equivalent of about 
ten cents. The piles, which they 
often carry for a distance of five 
miles, are half as tall again as the 
women. “No wonder they walk 
like goddesses.”
One of the most astounding 
sights shown on the screen was a 
group of carvings on the walls of

Carl Schurz Society 
“American Mind”
The ..Daum-Sanderson nationally 
famous recording and broadcasting 
orchestra has been secured to play 
at the Publications Dance Friday 
night at Thistle Hall. Pi Delta 
Epsilon, men’s journalistic honor­
ary, is sponsoring the dance and

The Daum-Sanderson orchestra 
is well known throughout the East 
as a result of its many broadcasts 
and is particularly famed for its 
ability to play all types of music. 
The versatility of the orchestra 
can best be described by the 
phrase, "Rhythm Magic in Modern 
Mood.”
As might be expected this or­
chestra has left behind it a contin­
uous trail of triumphs, the latest 
in this district being tlie Crafton 
Junior League Charity Ball and 
the Anatole Club’s Thanksgiving 
Ball at which event he was feat­
ured opposite Austin Wylie. En­
gagements at Penn State, Alle­
gheny and Geneva as well as many 
of the leading country clubs in the 
district are also on the list.
The dance Friday night will be 
the second Thistle Hall dance of 
the year to be broadcast. Music 
from the dance will be heard from 
WWSW.
Funds raised from the dance 
-will be used in promoting Pi-Delta- 
Epsilon’s second annual High 
School Journalistic contest.
The committee in charge of the 
dance consists of John Kronen- 
berg, chairman; James Stahl, Wil­
liam Lazarus, and Robert Robin­
son.
Chaperones for the dance will be 
Mr. and Mrs. Leo I. Lawler, Mr. 
and Mrs. Willard N. James, and 
Mr. and Mrs. Robert Sclimertz.
Graduate Wins 
Goedboef Prize
Caleb Hornbostle who graduated 
from the Department of Architec­
ture in 1929 has recently been hon­
ored by receiving the Goedboef 
prize at the Ecole de Beaux Arts 
in Paris. Unfortunately, however, 
being a foreigner he was ineligible 
for the monetary prize which usu­
ally accompanies it. Mr. Horn­
bostle is the first American to re­
ceive this Grand Prix since 1912.
The Goedboef prize is one which 
has been awarded for excellence in 
architectural design for over a 
hundred years.
The Ecole de Beaux Arts is a 
free national school run by the 
French government. Students from 
any country may attend this school 
and may enjoy all the honors., and 
privileges of studying with the 
great men of France. In recog­
nition for three years completed 
work at this school a diploma is 
given which identifies the gradu­
ate as an architect of the. French 
government. No student is allow­
ed to attend this school after he 
is thirty years of age. It is possi­
ble to earn ^ diploma in three 
years although no limit except that 
of age is imposed upon the number 
of years of work allowed.
The Ecole de Beaux Arts was 
founded by Napoleon and encom­
passes many branches of art in­
cluding Architecture, Sculpture, 
Painting, Music and Medallion 
work. Practically all the masters 
of France are graduates of this 
school.
Mr. Hornbostle will receive his 
diploma in June and will be the 
first Carnegie man to graduate 
from this school.
SECOND IN SERIES 
ON GERMAN TOUR
Will Speak in Dahlem, Berlin 
On January 20 Before 
Ex-Kaiser Wilhelm
Chorus Tryouts Held 
For Spring Carnival
Over thirty-five applicants for 
the dancing chorus in the Spring 
Carnival Musical Revue appeared 
in answer to a call issued last week. 
William Bales ’33, dancing direc­
tor, started the group with general 
instruction in stage dancing, and 
within a week the final selection 
of twelve girls and six men is to 
be made.
On Friday, January 13, the final 
tryout for singers was held, and a 
large group sang before Emanuel 
Breakstone, ’33, who is in charge 
of the singing for the Bacchana­
lians. There will have to be elim­
inations from this group also, and 
the names of those, selected will 
appear on the bulletin boards this 
week.
Dr. Baker, who Is lecturing in 
Germany under the auspices of the 
Oberlaender Trust of the Carl 
Sehurz Foundation, delivered the 
second of his series of lectures be­
fore a large and distinguished gath­
ering at the Haus der Presse in 
Berlin. Dr. Baker who spoke in 
German was introduced by Anton 
Erkelenz, president of the Carl 
Sehurz Society, and was enthusi­
astically received. The subject of 
his address was "The American 
Mjnd.”
Dr. Baker, according to a recent 
cable; landed at Hamburg on_ Jan­
uary 6 after several days of stormy 
weather and delivered his first ad­
dress “The Significance of the 
United States for Europe in the 
Twentieth Century” the following 
day in the Hamburg Union.
According to his schedule Dr. 
Baker spoke Friday at the English 
Seminar pf the University of Ber­
lin and again at the University 
yesterday. The other universi­
ties at which he will speak are 
those of Breslau, Koenigsberg, 
Goettingen, Heidelberg, and 
Munich. Besides the lectures 
which he will give under the 
auspices of the Oberlaender Trust, 
Dr. Baker will speak before the 
Kaiser Wilhelm Gesselschaft on 
January 20 in Dalilem, Berlin.
The trust under which the lec­
tures are being given was founded 
in April, 1931, by Gustav Ober­
laender as part of the memorial to 
Carl Sehurz, one of the most dis­
tinguished immigrants to this Coun­
try. The purpose of the memorial 
is to enrich the life and thought 
of the American people by promot­
ing understanding and good-will be- 
-tween the -peopie--©f -the- Germa-.v 
speaking coutries and the people 
of thè United States.

Van Orman 
To Relate Air 
Experiences
Famous Balloonist Will 
Speak Friday On 
Race Thrills
“Experiences in International 
Races” will be the title of Ward 
T. Van Orman’s lecture in the 
Union at 8:30 p. m., Friday. The 
internationally famous balloonist 
will illustrate his talk with motion 
pictures and lantern slides.
He is the holder of the first P. 
W. Litchfield trophy for winning 
three successive national contests 
and the James Gordan Bennett 
trophy for winning three interna­
tional events.
The Goodyear-Zeppelin Corpora­
tion’s exhibition at the National 
Aircraft Show is managed by Van 
Orman. He is familiar with all 
phases of transportation but is 
particularly well versed in aero­
nautics.
Van Orman, who was born in 
Lorain, Ohio, graduated from the 
Case School of Applied Science in 
Cleveland in 1917 as a mechanical 
engineer. Immediately following 
his graduation he joined the Good­
year organization at Akron as a 
free balloon and airship pilot, and 
continued his naval activities at 
Alaron throughout, the war.. At the 
close of the /war he became at­
tached to the aero-design division 
of Goodyear as an aeronautical 
engineer, and in 1926 joined the 
development department as de­
velopment engineer. In August, 
1929, he became director of the 
ground school of the Goodyear- 
Zeppelin Corporation.
During the fifteen years that Van 
Orman lias been with the Good­
year Corporation he has piloted 
its., entries in most of the national 
and international balloon races. Al­
though he was winner of three 
international events, it is quite 
generally conceded that he 
should have been awarded the in­
ternational race out of Brussels, 
Belgium, in 1925. In this race he 
was disqualified because his bal­
loon landed-on a steamship far out 
on the ocean. And in the national 
race out of Pittsburgh in 1928 he 
stood an excellent chance to win, 
but lightning struck his balloon, 
killing his aide, Walter Morton. In 
this thrilling experience, the only 
injury Van Orman sustained was á 
broken leg.
Following the Pittsburgh trag­
edy, he invented a lightning pro­
tective shield for his balloon. He 
was one of the first pilots to em­
ploy radio in balloon racing, and is 
the inventor of various .pieces of 
equipment to aid: in ballooning. Be­
sides the lightning arrester he has 
invented a leak-proof, bullet-proof, 
crash-proof gasoline container for 
aircraft, a new method of process­
ing fabric, an alarm altimeter, i 
new type vertimeter, special bal­
loon fabric,'landing pontoons, and 
protective cano_py.
CAMPUS PERSONALITIES
BY STANTON WILLIAMS
Mr. Arthur C. Jewett, Director 
of the School of Industries here 
since 1925, was born at Bath, 
Maine, and received his B.S. de­
gree at Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology in 1901. After being 
in the employ of the American 
Bridge Company as a machine 
shop draftsman, he went to the 
University of 
Maine to teach 
m ecliantes. 
Shortly after­
ward he as­
sumed charge 
of the Mechan­
ical Engineer­
ing Depart­
ment, which 
post he held 
the following 
nine years.
In 1914 a 
leave of ab­
sence was 
granted for 
the purpose of studying scientific 
management with Frank Gilbraitli. 
a leading consulting engineer. Mr. 
Jewett, choosing not to return to 
Maine, began practical work in 
this line as engineering manager 
for Bird and Son, manufacturers 
of paper, roofing and floor Cover­
ing. Shortage of raw materials oc-
Arthur Jewett
casioned by the war crippled the 
industry, so he transferred to the 
Winchester Repeating Arms Com­
pany which was rapidly expanding 
at this time.
After being ' superintendent of 
fcartridge production, Mr. Jewett 
was appointed to organize a cen­
tral engineering department over 
which he was superintendent. Dur­
ing the war he was a member of 
the committee on specifications for 
small arms, a body composed of 
manufacturers and U. S. Army 
representatives.
Prior to the company’s amalga­
mation with another organization 
during the post-war depression, lie 
aided in the development of other 
products of hardware and sporting 
goods nature, took part in person­
nel work, and was budget mana­
ger. In connection with the latter, 
interesting activities included 
overseeing warehouses throughout 
the east.
After doing research work in en­
gineering education for the Nation 
al Industrial Conference Board, 
Mr. Jewett was appointed in 1925 
to his present post.
Having spent his youth so near 
the Maine woods, Mr. Jewett is 
quite naturally very fond of fishing 
and hunting, especially sinCe part 
of his professional time was spent 
in developing the necessities for 
these sports.
Men’s Junior 
Prom Will Be 
In Wm. Penn
Tickets May Be Bought 
For §5.00 Before 
Night of Dance
COMMITTEE PLANS 
FAVOR ELIMINATION
Orchestra to he Selected 
From List of Noted 
Band Leaders
The Urban Room, located on the 
seventeenth floor of the William 
Penn Hotel, will be the scene of 
the Men’s Junior Prom on Friday, 
February 10. This popular loca­
tion has already been contracted 
for the prom, which is one of the 
two or three most important Car­
negie formals of the year. Assess­
ment has been set by the commit­
tee at $5.00 (pre-sale), and $5.5-0 
at the door. In accordance with 
the program of economy, favors 
for tlie prom will be dispensed 
with; hence there will probably be 
no grand march this year.
The Junior Prom will be the first 
formal affair of the year to be held 
off campus, and the occasion war­
rants the hiring of a particularly 
popular orchestra. Although the 
final choice of musicians has been 
delayed, music for the prom will 
be supplied by either Emerson 
Gill ‘ and his Cleveland orchestra 
from the Lotus Garden; Doc Pey­
ton and his "Anatole Club” orches­
tra; Red Nichols; Henry Busse; or 
Bernie Cummins and his orchestra., 
It is expected that tickets will be 
on sale beginning today, and the 
choice of an orchestra may be 
learned when tickets are out. They 
will be sold by committeemen at 
the points of distribution of the 
Tartan.
Committeemen and Delta Skulls 
who will have prom tickets for 
sale are Charles Slater, chairman; 
Louis Jagnow, vice chairman; 
Libbus Lewis; Julian van der 
Lancken; Charles Davis; Colin 
Stewart; Samuel Wicks; James

Physics Students 
Receive New Lab
The Department of Physics has 
just taken over the space vacated 
by the Department of Metallurgic­
al Research on the third floor of 
Engineering Hall. Members of 
the Physics Department as well as 
students will use the new space 
for research work.
Prof. J. B. Nathanson has stud­
ied the colors of thin films of pure 
manganese. These films have been 
produced by cathode sputterings 
of manganese which had been pu­
rified by vacuum distillation. Dr. 
Nathanson reported at the Physic­
al Society at Atlantic City on his 
recent work and showed that the 
colors in the manganese films 
were due to optical interference.
Prof. E. M. Pugh is continuing 
his studies in the 1-Iall effect in 
massive samples of iron. Dr. Pugh 
and Mr. Thomas Lippert have 
been able to extend previous work 
in this field and have just de-. 
scribed in the last Physical Re­
view their experiments showing 
that the Hall effect in thick pieces 
of iron is proportional to the dif­
ference between the induction and 
the magnetizing force.
Dr. E. E. Leberknight is contin­
uing his investigation in infra-red 
spectroscopy. Dr. Leberknight is 
using a new rock salt spectroscope 
especially constructed for his 
studies in the absorption of solu­
tions.
Senior “Y” Cabinet
Will Train Plebes
The first meeting of the fresh­
man Y cabinet will not take place 
until the first weeks of the second 
semester, as has been the custom 
in the past. The organization is 
under the sponsorship of the Y 
cabinet, and is open to all fresh­
men interested in Y. M. C. A. work, 
although an attempt is jnade to 
have two or three members of each 
fraternity enrolleu in the Cabinet, 
in order to obtain a well-rounded 
group.
The purpose of the freshman Y 
Cabinet is to train the plebes in 
the work of tlie Cabinet, to place 
them on the various improvement 
committees, and, in general, to as­
sist the Cabinet in its undertak­
ings.

The national exhibition of "Tho 
Fifty Books of the Year’’ will be 
shown here from January 23 to 
February G under the auspices of 
the Department of Printing. This 
will be the only opportunity for 
Pittsburghers to see this exhibi­
tion which is sponsored annually 
by the American Institute of 
Graphic Arts.
The exhibition will be open to 
the general public from 10 a. m. 
to 10 p. m. each day except Sun­
day in an exhibition room of the 
College of Fine Arts. The Depart­
ment of Printing is sending no­
tices of the event to the libraries, 
book stores, and teachers of print­
ing in Pittsburgh, and to tlie Car­
negie Library School.
More than 650 books were sub­
mitted this year by 150 publishers, 
printers, .and designers. Each year 
a jury composed of prominent men 
in the printing and publishing field 
makes the selection of "The Fifty 
Books of the Year.” The exhibition 
is then sent to all the large cities 
in the county. This is the ^econdj 
time that it has been shown in 
Pittsburgh.
On Tuesday evening, January 24, 
at 8:00, Mr. Laurance B. Siegfried, 
editor of "The American Printer,” 
will give an address on “The Fifty 
Books of the Year.” The public 
is invited to this meeting at which 
Mr. John L. Porter, chairman of 
the board of trustees of Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, will pre­
side.
Will Experiment^With 
Discussion Open 
To Assembly
MEN’S GLEE CLUB 
TO PROVIDE MUSIC
Prof. B. S. Dcnnisonj^Will 
Preside in Absence 
Of Pres. Baker
A new experiment will be im- 
dertaken at the chapel exercises 
this morning, at 12:30 in the Little 
Theater, when Rev. Dr. John Ray 
Ewers, pastor of the East End 
Christian Church, will speak on 
“War Debts,” and then lead an 
open discussion on tho subject.
If today's experiment proves suc­
cessful, the practice of open dis­
cussions will be, in all probability, 
continued in the future. All stu­
dents are urged to attend, since 
this discussion will offer an excel­
lent opportunity for education in 
present-day economic problems, 
which President Thomas S. Baker, 
during a recent interview before 
departing for Germany, declared to 
be essential to students in engi­
neering courses.
Dr. Ewers is locally famous Cor 
his forum discussions and is par­
ticularly adept at leading them. 
He lias traveled through Europe 
extensively, and has studied • for­
eign economic conditions for tho 
express purpose of obtaining mate­
rial for his church forums. His 
talk should be particularly inter­
esting to the students of Carnegie 
for this reason. He has previous­
ly talked at several campus func­
tions.
Prof. B. S. Dennison, of the De­
partment of Electrical Engineer­
ing, will preside in tho absence of 
Dr. Baker. Music will bo furnish­
ed by the Carnegie Men’s Glee 
Club.
At the beginning of tho chapel 
services, the Men’s Glee Club will 
sing two well-known numbors: 
"Now Let Every Tongue Adoro 
Thee,” by Johann Sebastian Bach, 
and "All Through tho Night,” an 
old Welsh melody. The. organic ¡ 
at chapel will be C. Richard Giin. 
er, a night school student in tho 
Department of Music, who is tho 
Glee Club pianist. Ho has select­
ed for the prelude Bach’s "Pre­
lude and Fugue In E Minor.” The 
postludo he will present is "Two 
Noels” by Guilmont.
Plans for New 
Thistle Will Be 
Completed Soon
Plans aro now being completed 
for the 1933 Thistle, which will ap­
pear on tho campus May 20. Pub­
lished every year by the junior 
class, the Thistle will this year in­

There will be photographs of 
such major events as Arts Ball, 
Campus Week, Carnegie Day, tho 
Freshman Parade, and tho Sweep­
stakes. Many Incidents of frater­
nity and dormitory life will also bo

“Maggie Murphs” Wonder if Drinking 
Fountains are Merely Wall Fixtures
By ANNA LADD
Water, water everywhere — but | one on each floor, 
not a drop to drink!¦VSJliat can 
this be? A cry from some one 
marooned on a far-off desert is­
land? No, it is only a fair, young 
Tech co-ed wailing her troubles to 
her fellow students. She is trying 
her hardest to get a drink, even 
a swallow, of pure, sparkling I-I20 
(water to you), but without appa­
rent success.
Is she from Margaret Morrison? 
Why, yes, can't you tell? Well, 
what if she is? Drinking foun­
tains? Oh, you mean those white 
porcelain, basin-1 Ike fixtures fas­
tened on the wall in the hall? You 
say that you press a handle and 
water is supposed to spurt up into 
tlie air? Yes, they are still in 
Margaret Morrison, but—. Oh, 
haven't you heard? I’ll tell you.
Some time ago, it must have 
been some time last year, or per­
haps it was at the end of the year 
before that—well, anyway, as I 
was saying—a long time ago there 
were five properly functioning 
fountains in Margaret Morrison,
As soon as the little shiny handle was pressed 
downward, four thin streams of 
water spurted upward and united 
into one large stream about four 
or five inches above tho pipe in 
the center of the fountain. Then, 
all a person, a thirsty person, had 
to do was to press the handle, 
bend her head, encircle her dainty 
mouth around the water, and 
swallow, and swallow.
Even drinking fountains havo 
been effected by the depression; 
Now, when this same thirsty per­
son approaches any one of the fivo 
fountains, bends lior fair head, 
presses the handle, and opens her 
mouth, nothing happens. That is, 
instead of a sudden spurt of water, 
there are four feeble streams of 
water which come out of the pipe 
in tlie center of the fountain, 
trickle over the side of the pipe, 
run down the drain and disappear 
from sight—warm water a I that.
What chance does a gal have 
anyway? No drinking water, ner 
nuthin’.

FACES PITT
BY JOE BRONSON
SILVERMAN, RIGGS 
OUT WITH INJURIES
The Intramural Basketball 
League swung into action last 
night when four games were 
played. Among the teams to start 
were two runners-up for the cham­
pionship last year, the Kappa 
Sigma Fraternity and the Senior 
Architects. Englebreclit Hall, the 
defending champions, have not en­
tered a team up to this time, al­
though it is expected that they 
will. With the new scramble for 
positions in the leagues all the 
teams'find themselves with a new 
set of opponents. The American 
League seems to be a battle for the 
championsliip between the Pi. K. 
A’s and the Delts, the National 
League looks like a victory for 
Kappa Sigma, and in the Federal 
League the Senior Architects and 
the Betas look strongest.
This year the Intramural com­
petition will be run by a board 
consisting of three faculty mem­
bers, three fraternity representa­
tives and one dorm man. This 
board will handle all disputes aris­
ing from the games, 'me mem­
bers are Dr. Esquerre, Mr. Moses, 
Mr. Risedorph, George Meyers, 
Kappa Sigma; John Ladd, Pi 
Kappa Alpha; R. E. Land, Alpha 
Sigma Phi; and F. A. Standt, Boss 
Hall. Tliis board will also have 
charge of intramural swimming, 
wrestling, and mush ball.
Some dispute arose as to whether 
the new inter-collegiate rules 
should be used or not. It was de­
cided that the regular college rules 
will be enforced by the officials. 
Two of the most important changes 
that have been made from last 
year are no team can retain pos­
session of the ball for more than 
ten seconds in their half of the 
court, and the pivot man cannot 
hold the ball for more than three 
seconds. It is suggested that all
Although beset by all kinds of 
injuries known to basketball, play­
ers, Max Hannum has yet to see 
his team lose a game since he 
started coaching at Carnegie.
His two most famous cripples, 
Mr. “Angus” Fergus and Mr. 
"LouIe-the-Ace” Jagnow, who have 
no equals in this section at their 
respective positions, do not seem 
to have that old dazzling speed 
since the docs removed parts of 
their knees, even though they have 
been the main cogs in the three 
Tartan victories so far. Ted Rigg, 
another fine guard, has also been 
suffering from injuries, but the 
final and most aggravating blow 
came last Friday when “Red” Sil­
verman, another star defenseman, 
got knocked flatter than the plains 
of Iowa by a high-low block as 
demonstrated by two of W. & J’s 
best grid warriors. Incidently the 
Skibo cohorts handed the Prexies 
an unmerciful drubbing, 31-20, in 
spite of the absence of the first 
string throughout most of the 
game.
The Temple game was a thriller 
from start to finish, and the crowd 
went home well satisfied with the 
evening’s entertainment. Carnegie 
took an early lead and held it 
throughout most of the first half, 
but the Owls put on a whirlwind 
finish that knotted the count at 
17-all at half time. In the second 
period the Tartans again started 
a hard drive and rolled up a good­
ly five point lead early in the pro­
ceedings. Temple came right back 
with a ten point rally that placed 
them in a similar position, but 
their lead had short duration. 
With a minute to play, Bobbie 
Smith gave the plaid a momentary 
32-30 lead, but a twin foul toss 
quickly erased this advantage and 
the game ended with all even. In 
the overtime period, Stentz, Jag­
now, and Silverman sunk baskets 
in rapid succession, and this 
proved too much for the Cherry 
and White to overcome.
(Ed. Note: Jim Ilalforty pinch hitting.)
THIS BUSINESS OF BEING ON THE INJURED LIST has at last 
gono too far. You oxpoct football and basketball players to get hurt 
occasionally, and juot chalk It up to hard luck, but when the sports 
odltor of this noble sheet is ailing—that's the last straw. Mr. Bron­
son, It sooms, came out second best In an auto argument but Is doing 
nicely, thank you, although he probably will have a difficult job In 
convincing his more skeptical friends that the shiner also went with 
the accident.
Kavel and Sample Are 
Outstanding Players 
Leaving in June
With the passing of the 1932 
football season the reviewing of 
the separate achievements of mem­
bers of the team Is current talk. 
We would wish to do this our­
selves, but space is limited, so 
only a brief survey will be given 
of the men, those who graduate at 
the end of the school year, and 
those who receive Carnegie letters 
for their active service.
Most outstanding of the men 
who fought football “for the glory 
of Carnegie” this year were, of 
course, the co-captains Sample 
and Kavel. Sample is one of tho 
best and surest guards in the dis­
trict, and with a consistent record 
of achievement since prep-school 
days, it is unnecessary to expand 
further upon Ills merits. Kavel is 
exceptional as a fast, hard-hitting 
back, and a fine broken field run­
ner. He earned for himself the 
reputation of the hardest worker 
in practice, where he was always 
a display of great and controlled 
energy, his practice charges being 
equal to those exhibited against 
the Pitt line. These two men leave 
us this year, as do the eight who 
follow next on our list.
Ostrosky is best described as the 
small and flashy end, who was 
particularly effective in receiving 
passes. McCurdy is one of the trio 
of quarterbacks that saw a lot of 
action for Tech this year, showing 
excellent qualities in managing the 
team on the field. Seigal we feel 
to be a fine center, kept out of ex­
tensive service because of the stiff 
competition for that position. In 
Coulter, who played Ills first year 
of football during his last here 
at Tech, we believe Carnegie would 
have an outstanding halfback wero 
he to be with us longer. Coulter 
made Ills first touchdown in tho 
Western Reserve game, and not 
long after showed sterling quality 
by his action in the N. Y. U. game. 
Playing tackle, Croissant did not 
lmve much opportunity to show his 
talent this past season, but ho gave
a. good nccount of himself notice­
ably for a short time during the 
Notre Dame game. Duoger, alter­
nating quarterback with Bovevino, 
continued this year Ills fine work 
of last year. The last of the .ten 
men who are graduating in tho 
spring is Kobe, team standby In 
the guard position and a merltablo 
dofonso man.
Thoro is still a promising array 
of lottormon remaining for Coach 
llurpstor to start with. Tho ma­
terial at tho onds escaped almost 
unscatched from tho ax of gradu­
ation with tho two regulars Stewart 
and Tessor roturnlng with Good­
rich and Kay Burns to aid them. 
Thoro Is a wealth of material at
l ho tackle position Including Fors- 
man, Croft, Plummer, Nutlor, and 
Holloway. Tho loss of Jones at 
center will probably necessitate the 
use' of Dresluvr at that position 
which leaves Burzio and I-Ioinzer
lo play the guards. The strength 
of the line leads us to believe that 
the backs will tell the story. 
Bevevino, the only remaining quar­
terback, must find assignments for 
Spizalc, Milim, Carlson, O’Toole, 
and Sayles.
Tartans Hope to Continue 
Winning Streak And 
Settle Old Score
Civil war will again reign in the 
Schenley Park district this Wed­
nesday when the Hannum machine 
clashes with the cohorts of Dr. 
Carlson in the Carnegie gym. This 
will be the first of a series of three 
games between tho city rivals.
Although .the Tartans have yet 
to be defeated, Pitt will enter the 
game a distinct favorite as far as 
comparative scores go. To date, 
the Panthers have won six games 
and liavo lost two, these two be­
ing to Northwestern, Big Ten fa­
vorites, and to Chick Davies' city 
champs from up on the Bluff. Car­
negie lias played three games and 
has won them all. The plaid had 
a very difficult time beating the 
Temple Owls in an overtme game 
last Tuesday, however, while the 
Carlson proteges have trounced 
the Philadelphians by a 43-26 
score. Pitt also claims victories 
over Purdue, defending champions 
of the Big Ten, Minnesota, Indiana, 
Butler and Georgetown. Carnegie 
has beaten West Virginia, Temple, 
and Wash-Jeff.
Injuries will handicap both 
teams, but the ¦ Tartans seem to 
have the edge as far as number of 
casualties go. Pitt will not have 
Cribbs, its star center, in the line­
up, while Carnegie will probably 
be without the services of either 
Rlgg or Silverman, two of its most 
reliable guards. In addition, Fer­
gus and Jagnow are just recovering 
from major operations upon their 
knees. To offset these injuries, 
though Max Hannum can thank 
Ills lucky stars that Co-captain Bob­
by £mith is very much “on” this 
year; in fact, it looks as if the
MAX HANNUM’S BASKETBALL TROUBLES are just beginning. Dor 
Maxie, gum and all, has piloted his boys in masterful fashion through 
two closo games and an easy one' thus far, but tomorrow up In, the 
gym tho Sklbos meet Pitt and with three of the regulars still being 
nursed along, thing» could be brighter. Following tho Pitt game— 
like the three trees—are Genova (there), Duquesne (there), Notre, 
Daine (and there). Pitt downed a bitter 2G-25 pill from Duquesne last 
Friday and will bo plenty anxious to redeem herself in the local 
sport realm against our Tartans. From comparative scores and one 
thing and another, Pitt will enter the game as the favorite. But those 
of us who saw tho Temple game know that this year’s basketball out­
fit has plenty of what it takes to make a winner, so ir you want to 
miss a good, scrappy, typical Carnegie-Pitt contest, stay home Wednes­
day night.
THAT TEMPLE GAME AGAIN. It surely was one of the most ex­
citing staged in the Gym for many a night. According to the local 
grapevine telegraph the Owls played a much better game against Car­
negie than they did against Pitt—but of course we would say some­
thing like that. Things looked pretty blue for a while in the second 
half when Temple hung up ten straight points for a comfortable lead, 
but it was worth all that trouble to watch the team tie it up again. 
The Templo Merriwell who sunk those two fouls at the “crooshall” 
moment to tie up the ball game deserves a lot of credit. If you don’t 
think that’s hard just try it some time. And little “Moe” Silverman 
added a lot of color to the game. “Moe” sank a couple of long ones 
to share the spotlight with big Ed Stentz. Bobby Smith only made 
15 points, but It's early in the season as yet, so don’t be alarmed.
NOT MUCH TO SAY about W. & J. (rhyme), except that it gave 
Coach Hannum a chance to rest his cripples and at the same time 
glvo tho reserves an opportunity to gain a little experience. Fresh­
man Coach Jimmy Leonard’s team is also among the undefeated al­
though after Wednesday—well, good luck, Pee Wee.
LOCAL SPORT FOLLOWERS read with mingled surprise and amuse­
ment an article that appeared In one of the Sunday papers in which 
Dr. Ralph C. Hutchison, President of Washington and Jefferson, ex­
pressed confidence that the great majority of eastern colleges and uni­
versities will have eliminated subsldation of athletes by next fall. 
Dr. Hutchison added that after a period of a year or two when the 
subsidized athletes now In school will have graduated, Wash-Jeff will 
be able to compete on an even footing with the best-known colleges 
In the East. Dr. Hutchison is noted for his sincerity and sportsman­
like qualities and although many will disagree with him on the results 
of his latest sojourn Into athletic fields, his opinion will, nevertheless, 
bear weight. One thing is certain and that Is, “subsldation” and 
“proselyting” are still horrid words In some quarters. However, this 
Is tho open season on college athletics and as usual, Carnegie follow­
ers will sit back smugly, listen to the arguments pro and con, let 
those most competent handle Tartan athletic affairs, and be out in a 
body to back tho teams whatever tho game may be. But good luck 
Just the same, Dr. Hutchison, and may Carnegle-W. & J. athletic rela­
tions bo as fine In the future as they have been In the past.
)N CONJUNCTION WITH THE ECONOMIC PROGRAM going into 
offoct in Carnegie athletics, intramural sports will, for tho most part 
Hupplomenl; freshman competition. Intramural basketball starts this 
week and >vlll occupy tho attention of the Greeks for (lie next few 
months. Intramural swimming will take tho place of freshman 
aquatics In thin sport as woll, wlillo boxing, wrestling and tennis are 
tentative Intramural competitions. As usual, tho fraternity and dormi­
tory longue In dlvldod Into throe sub-divisions: Amorlcnn, National 
and Podornl. Tho defending champs In that order aro PI Kappa 
Alpha, Kappa Sigma and Engolbroet Hall. In all probability tho win­
ner of Onrnoglo competition will again tangle with the victors of 
Pitt Jntorfratomity Imalcotball, for the city championship.

ROBERT SMITH, ForwardTHE NEW
DUQUESNE 
GARDEN
IS NOW OPEN FOR
lanky plaid is slated for the great­
est season of his career. He has 
been high scorer in every game 
played this season.
At center will undoubtedly be 
Ed Stentz, who has been playing 
extraordinarily fine ball so far. 
His ability to get the tipoff gives 
added strength to the Skibo atfack, 
and his reach is also of great ad­
vantage under the basket, both of­
fensively and defensively.
Tho forward posts will be han­
dled by Smith and Jagnow in their 
usual capable manner. Bill Carl­
son will be right there to relieve 
Jagnow when Coach Hannum fig­
ures it necessary to conserve the 
big fellow’s strength.
At guard will be Fergus and 
Rigg or Siegal. Both Silverman 
and Rigg are on the injured list, 
but it -is possible that one or both 
of them will be in shape to play. 
Angus Fergus will undobtedly play 
his usual dependable game, al­
though his leg is not considered 
to be fully recovered as 'yet.
With the exception of Cribbs, 
the Pitt lineup will be the same as 
has started in most of the games 
this season. Captain Don Smith, 
the two Hugheses, Ochsenliirt, Wai- 
nio, and Wilson will probably see 
action against the Tartans._________

DIDJA NOTICE
THAT the Post-Holiday Dance 
this Saturday night will give us 
a swell opportunity to celebrate 
the end of the first semester. 
I’ll be seenya there.
THAT a certain group of male 
night students are getting rath­
er nervous as a particular date 
approaches. Cheer up, boys, 
others are just as nervous wait­
ing for a chance to get to work 
on you.
THAT the harmonizing done 
at a stag party recently was of 
a very high caliber an.d the 
most frequently heard expres­
sion was: "Here, Urbie, pdt this 
in the corner."
THAT one fellow is in hot 
water because of this affair, for 
by obeying the orders of one 
group he incurred the ill will of 
another, and will he pay for it, 
soon?
THAT, despite the vigilance 
of two door keepers your snoop­
ing reporter crashed the Indus­
tries dance held recently..............
THAT those industries boys 
again showed us just how a 
dance should be held. The only 
thing I like better is an Arts 
dance in Thistle Hall.
THAT two students in the 
Arts school are looking daggers 
at each other these foggy nights 
and days.
THAT next week marks the 
beginning of the end of some 
of us as far as finding out how 
much we know is concerned.
THAT everybody seems wor­
ried about final exams, but the 
Art students. Wonder just what 
their finals, if any, are like 
over there?
THAT that's that and I’ll be 
seenya.
Expresses Views 
On Latest Exhibit
An. exhibition of modern prints 
now being held at one of the galler­
ies of the Carnegie Institute will 
interest all those who have never 
been able to fully comprehend- the 
aims of the modernists, nor iden­
tify their works with a particular 
movement.
A sincere and convincing effort 
is being made to acquaint the or­
dinary layman with the art move­
ments of the past and present, and 
to tear down the walls of prejudice 
that stand between the experiment­
al artist and the conservative lay­
man;
We are informed that Impres­
sionistic, Futuristic and all like ex­
pressive words included in the cat­
egory of the istics, have specific 
meanings, and are applicable to 
definite movements or periods. 
Such terms, we are cautioned, 
should not be used interchangea- 
ably by the public when referring 
to the novel,.strange or misunder­
stood aspects of modern arts.
—where is justice. But then, that 
is my view, maybe someone else 
will think that his replica is more 
beautiful than mine and would be 
glad to watch the burdie flutter 
from a lenz controlled by the state. 
Guess we will have a society of 
prevention of cruelty to photog­
raphers—who knows.
And, speaking of prevention of 
cruelty to such and such, I have a 
little pet hobby which I will ride 
soon, maybe next week, but just 
now I will sign off before I get the 
light . . . That was the Idle 
Night Student signing off until this 
time next week. ~ru~ 'r-u:',~
Post-Holiday Dance Will be 
Held in Gym Saturday Night
Committees Selection of George McCormack and 
His Orchestra for Affair Marks First Appearance 
Of Popular Musicians for Night School
Another of those gala affairs 
sponsored by the Night Student 
Council is to be held this Satur­
day night, January 21. The Post- 
Holiday Dance as it is called, and 
appropriately so, coming as it does 
after the holidays, but just before 
the final examination period of the 
night classes.
Getting back to school after a 
holiday season ^filled with social ac­
tivities and settling down to the 
monotonous night school grind is a 
hard assignment to say the least, 
but to have final examinations 
thrust upon you is almost too much. 
This dance, therefore, comes as a 
welcome relief and gives us an 
evening of entertainment and pleas­
ure so that we can approach the 
ordeal in a lighter frame of mind.
The social chairman has an­
nounced that George McCormack 
and his orchestra have been select­
ed to.furnish music for this affair. 
The band is a well known musical 
group around the Pittsburgh dis­
trict having broadcasted many pro­
grams over IvDKA. They have also 
broadcasted on several sponsored 
programs over the chain networks. 
Something new and different is 
promised the dancers during the 
evening in the way of music. That 
George McCormack will give us 
melodies which will linger long 
with us and make us ask for more 
is certain.
As usual the huge men’s gymna­
sium will be transferred into the 
ballroom filled with colored lights 
and gay hangings so that one will 
feel impelled to enjoy the party to 
the utmost. Gay tantalizing music, 
soft lights, and. a good dance part­
ner will make a combination that 
means an evening of enjoyment 
which will long be remembered.

A prominent local artist in ex­
pressing his contempt for the vari­
ous experimental movements stated 
that modern art .is original, but so 
is insane art. While there is much 
truth in this statement, the fact re­
mains that many of the most con­
firmed experimentalists are really 
brilliant artists working to evolve 
a newer and higher art expressive 
of the present era.
A typical art student, with train­
ing in elementary design, can find 
much to amuse him in Modiaan’s 
“Compositions in Rectangles.” As­
suming that it is classed as a work 
of art, the student has much cause 
for wonderment.
Which, he may ask, is the artist 
of the loftier alms, one who seeks 
to provide esthetic pleasure for 
others by the juxtaposition of the 
elements of design to spiritual pro­
pinquity in the manner of the old 
masters, or one who continues to 
trifle with the fundamentals of de­
sign, the principles of which have 
long been established axioms?
The question, however, remains 
a speculative one, to which an 
answer cannot at present be formu­
lated, but which time and changing 
point of view may eventually sat­
isfy.

Arts Ball Design 
Contest Opfen To 
Night Students
Night arts students are encour­
aged to enter designs for the com­
petition in connection with the 
coming Arts Ball, which is to be 
held 011 February 17. Interest 
among the night arts groups con­
cerning the. ball is already much 
in evidence, and many original and 
unique designs are expected to 
come from their ranks.
Life on the planet Mars, a sub­
ject which affords unlimited oppor­
tunity to delve into the realms of 
imaginative fancy, is to be the 
theme of the ball. The problems 
are to design a poster, a costume 
and a program cover. Solutions to 
each problem should be expressive 
of the theme. The costume should 
be simple, unique and economical 
Posters and covers will be judged 
for composition and design quality.
Further information regarding 
prizes and specifications may be 
found on bulletin boards throughout 
the Arts School.
Night Thistle
Staff is Chosen
With the. appointment of the 
Night Thistle Staff by Presidentt 
Hodder of the Niglit Student Coun­
cil at the last council meeting, all 
the staff positions have been filled. 
Mr. C. A. Blocliinger assumes the 
duty of the Night Editor, and Mr. 
A. J. Lois, that of Night Business 
Manager.
This staff is making plans to 
have the night section as complete 
as possible and will require the 
cooperation of the night student 
body to make it so. After the pre­
liminary schedules are arranged a 
call will be issued for the various 
group pictures which make up the 
night section to assemble for pic­
tures as well as the individual pic­
tures of these students who will 
complete courses this year. When 
the call is made the staff will ap- 
predate and prompt response of 
the groups.
Announcements about the Thistle 
and the schedules will appear In

First Industries 
Dance Successful
Last week the officers of the 
Night College of Industries opened 
that history book wherein is record­
ed the results of each social event 
of the night school year, and en­
thusiastically inscribed another 
success, their first dance which was 
held on January 7.
In previous years the industries 
students held two smokers during 
the school year, but last year the 
officers of the Night College of In­
dustries undertook to include a 
dance in their social program for 
the college. This venture was de­
cided upon after a conference with 
the Night Social Chairman who en­
thusiastically supported the project.
While dancing is not entirely new 
to the men registered in industries, 
for them to sponsor a dance was, 
but they carried the party through 
in excellent style. Those respon­
sible for the affair figured that the 
men in industries supported the 
major dances given by the Night 
Student Council and held that the 
dancing ability of the college was 
the equal of any dancing artist.
Bill Ivulesz and his Kilties fur­
nished a varied program of dance 
music and this band of musicians 
certainly made another name for 
themselves. They are becoming 
quite popular on the campus.
The guests of the evening were 
Mr. and Mrs. Walter J. Staley, Mr. 
and Mrs. W. H. Dosey, Mr. and 
Mrs. Aiton, who chaperoned the 
dance, arid the members of the 
Kiltie Band.
An unexpected feature of the 
dance was the serving of refresh­
ments in the form of box lunches 
and pop, typical Indeed of Indus­
tries, and those responsible for the 
affair are to be commended highly 
for their efforts. All that remains 
to add Is that we hope the affair 
will becoriie traditional, as we know 
industries can support .such an af­
fair.

will be given an opportunity for 
representation.
Graduate Plans 
Automatic Test 
Marking Machine
Iu a letter to E. Bickley, ’10, 
Mechanical Engineering, Prof. W, 
C. L. Trinks mentioned jokingly 
that Bickley might turn his in­
genuity from automatic bean sort­
ing (Tartan, December 6) to auto­
matic grading of students’ exami­
nations. Bickley came back-with 
the following "invention.”
The student is given a slip with, 
say, eight horizontal columns (1 
to S) and 24 vertical columns (A 
to X). He is also given a separate 
sheet with eight questions (1 to S) 
and 24 answers (A to X), eight of 
which are correct answers aud 16 
of which are not answers to any 
of the eight questions. The stu­
dent punches a hole in the square 
at tliè intersection of a question 
line and of what he considers to 
be the correct-auswer-line. The 
slips are dumped into • a sorting 
machine, which throws out all 
slips'with more than one hole in 
any horizontal column and then 
proceeds to count the correct 
answers.
It looks as if we might soon dis­
pense with teachers, because in­
struction can be given by sound 
films, and examinations can be 
given by janitors. However, we 
shall still need .someone to make 
up the examinations and to set 
the grading machine. And that 
latter task will probably be bigger 
than that of marking papers, un­
less we have to deal with mass ex­
aminations.

Trial Iioard Finds
Fraternity Guilty
Continued From Pago 1
that on Monday, December 11, 
Belanger told her that he had re­
ceived a Delta Upsilon pledge pin 
on Sunday morning, December 11.
Following the reading of the let­
ter, there was a short pause In the» 
, proceedings, and then Robert 
Robinson, Delta tJpsilon’s repre­
sentative, rose. He calmly ad­
mitted the guilt of his fraternity 
in violating the Council’s rushing 
rules.
Upon admission of the violation, 
Boyle pleaded leniency for Delta 
Upsilon. He explained that the 
charge of guilt signified that the 
fraternity would bo prevented 
from participating in all intra­
mural competition, besides the $50 
fine imposed. After a short ques­
tioning of both representatives by 
Dean Keeble and Professor Car­
roll, the other faculty members of 
the Board, the six Board members 
left the room. Everyone in the 
clubroom was fully aware of the 
seriousness of the situation as they 
awaited the decision of the men 
outside. As the Board re-appeared 
there was an uncertain hesitancy 
on the part of the Council which 
rose to receive the decision.
Professor Leigliou read the state­
ment of the Board:
January 14, 1933.
To the Interfraternity Council 
Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology.
Gentlemen:
Having heard and considered 
the evidence to the effect tnar. 
the Delta Upsilon Fraternity 
of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology in the case of 
Charles Belanger violated Sec­
tion 12 of the Fraternity Rush­
ing Rules on December 11, 
1932, we, the members of the 
Trial Board find the said fra­
ternity guilty of violating both 
the spirit and letter of the 
regulations.
President Stahl thanked the 
Trial Board, in the behalf of the 
Council, for its co-operation. When 
the faculty representatives left the 
room, Stalil proceeded with the 
other case before the Council.
This case did not involve the 
rushing rules, but related to viola­
tion of the Constitution of the Ili­
ter fraternity Council. Delta Tan 
Delta fraternity claimed that Dolta 
Upsilon fraternity had pledged 
David Leo, a rusliee, when the 
ruslioo had previously pledged 
Dolta Tail Delta. In explaining the 
significance of this act, Ira Kuhn, 
Delta Tail Delta, brought out the 
fact that the Constitution statos 
that a man who has plodgod to one 
fraternity must wait ono full 
somoHter before pledging to an­
other fraternity.

Intelligence Not 
Enough to Succeed
Fortunately, it takes all kinds of 
people to make a world. This alone 
assures a place for all of us. But 
where might that place be?
The psychologists at Purdue Uni­
versity studied the exceptionally 
successful graduates of the engi­
neering school and discovered that 
originality and front—first-class 
personal appearance — wore the 
chief characteristics of those en­
joying the highest incomes. The 
two next strongest traits were ag­
gressiveness and enthusiasm which 
were immedlntetly followed by ac­
curacy and self-reliance. Humor, 
neatness, and sincerity were cor­
related with success only to a very 
slight degree, while moral habits 
were not correlated at all. Reason­
ing power ranked twelfth in the 
list.
After reading this report we 
might conclude that as many suc­
cessful engineers had very bad 
moral habits as good ones; also, 
that the rarest combination In the 
make-up of men is superior intel­
ligence and superior powers of or­
ganization and leadership.
Therefore, if we are hopeful of 
enjoying material success, we can­
not be too optimistic when wo 
merely get high marks in school. 
We must combine scholarship with 
leadership.
men distracted the attention of the 
Council as they stalked into the 
room. They sat in the chairs re­
cently vacated by the Trial Board. 
Ira Kuhn requested the President 
to ask these men, who were wit­
nesses for the Delta Upsilon frater­
nity, to take an oath upon their 
honor to tell nothing but the truth 
in any evidence given by. them. 
Among the witnesses was David 
Lee.
Upon the refusal of Kuhn to bo 
questioned before Dolta Upsilon 
presented the evidence, William 
Lazarus, Delta Upsilon, proceeded 
to emphasize that Lee had never 
been a Dolta Tau Dolta pledge. Ho 
called witnesses who denied over 
seeing a Delta pledge pin on Loo. 
When Loe was questioned, ho fal­
tered that ho never considered him­
self a Delta Tau Delta plodgo.
Delta Tau Delta pointed to tlio 
fact' that Leo had worn a plodgo 
pin in their house and on tlio 
campus. After considerable crosn- 
examInatlon, It was moved and soc- 
ondod that David Lee bo doclaroil 
a pledge to Dolta Tau Delta.
All tlio witnesses loft the room 
as the members prepared tliolr bal­
lots. The ballots were conn tod 
and the motion was defeated. Tho 
Council found Loo not to luivo boon 
a Delta Tau Dolta plodgo, making 
his plodgoshlp with tho Dolta Upul-

Gee it must be terrible to have to 
wait for sixty-one years to have a 
dancing ban lifted, from a campus 
-—where was this ban. Well it was 
at the Ohio Northern University, 
and there hadn't been a dance on 
¡the campus since 1871. Think what 
that might mean to the night stu­
dents of Carnegie Tech. Glad we 
don’t have such antics to contend 
with.
Where would the Industries be 
if such a ban existed for them. 
There would be no hopping, just 
work. However, we are glad to re­
port that no prohibtion existed and 
the Industries threw a hop and 
what a hop it was. Did you notice, 
my apologies to my contemporary, 
thet clever program with the little 
yellow pencils attached. Certainly 
did depict in an exceptional way a 
red hot affair. Those industries 
men are there with the goods when 
it comes to putting over an affair. 
Their smokers are the last word, 
now comes a dance and the success 
of it makes all of us look forward 
to another one and then more.
The cute little lunch boxes served 
as refreshments was a novel idea to 
say the least, and what these box­
es contained was another idea, 
and one idea coupled with-another, 
makes two, which were how many 
sandwiches the boxes contained. 
Then you had apples and pop. Did 
they hit the spot, well are.you ask­
ing me, or am I telling you—at all 
events, they did, and that is saying 
something. It isn't often I say 
something, but when I do, I open 
my mouth and on this occasion it 
was wide indeed.
Speaking of dances brings to my 
mind another frolic which is to be 
held this Saturday in the men's 
gymnasium. This time it i.s the 
Night Student Council who will 
sponsor the affair. They call it the 
Post-Holiday Dance, but to my 
mind it should be called the pre- 
holiday dance since it will be be­
fore we enter into that time when 
the old ax falls on us from the 
profs. Yes, I know I should have 
all my work in and should have 
paid strict attention to my studies, 
to the exclusion of all other dis­
traction, extraction, or any other 
traction, that is if I care to remain 
a night student, but, who cares to 
be a book lizzard in these days of 
ocracy.
Still hearing about those tech- 
nocricians or whatever you care to 
eali them. I am sorta fed up on 
(the whole question. Do they, or 
don’t they know what they are 
writing about, I don’t and when I 
say I don’t I mean just that. How­
ever, maybe some day we will all 
be let In on the secret and get some 
of the very elusive statistics which 
enables them to prognosticate—gee 
that was a big tongue twister, bet 
the editor will give me more points 
for the thoughts, what will happen 
in the year of 550G or some such 
time. I won’t care and neither will 
the rest of them for that matter.
Well, how are your old year res­
olutions holding up under the acid 
¦test of a couple of weeks? The 
year is not very young now, just 
two-and-one-half weeks old, but 
what a long time for one who might 
be on a resolution diet. Certainly 
would like to hear some of the ex­
cuses which are made on the vari­
ous occasions when the tests are 
put and decisions have to be made. 
Bet Solomon would be a piker in 
arbitrating the confugilty.
I noticed in the papers, why cer­
tainly I read the newspapers, that 
the photographers have come to an 
agreement to try to get laws en­
acted to license picture takers. 
Not so very long ago the barbers 
secured some sort of legislature 
to prevent one from getting his 
hair cut except by an official of 
the state. Certalaly is too bad 
that our hair grows so that these 
scissors swingers can crop our 
locks. Now the photographers, 
jealous of the preference which the 
bahbers have, come along and want 
to place a ban on our tin-types. It 
seems that somebody is always 
taking the joy out of life by plac­
ing a ban on the things we like to 
do. Now sitting for a picture is 
one of the supreme delights of my 
life, and to think that my operator 
will have to be a lincensed prac­
titioner makes me want to cry out

The Interfraternity Council Acts
When the Interfraternity Council made provisions tor a 
Trial Board to handle all rushing rule infractions, it was be­
lieved to be a step that would do much to bring about an ef­
fective enforcement of the rules. This belief has been confirm­
ed as a result of the business-like manner in which it function­
ed last Saturday in handling the first case to be brought before 
the council. It is unfortunate that one fraternity bad to be the 
object of experimentation and held up as the I-told-you-so ex­
ample when there were other obvious infractions by other 
houses. The Board has established the Interfraternity Council 
as a functioning body and has given teeth to the mandates 
passed by it. The Board takes all power away from the Coun­
cil in settling such matters and allows decisions to be reached 
in an impartial manner.
By giving an explicit statement of the fraternity’s guilt, 
the Board paved the way which may eventually realize the 
dreams of many men on the campus who have hoped to see the 
Council actually invested with executive power. In past years 
the Council amounted to nothing more than a group represent­
ing the various campus fraternities, but this status lias changed. 
Admittedly, the fraternity found guilty will suffer, but such a 
drastic step had to be taken to uphold the Council’s authority 
and to give the fraternities notice that rushing rules will be 
enforced in the future. The action will also give encourage­
ment to those houses that tried to observe the rules both in 
spirit and in letter.
Credit is due to this year’s Council for the willingness to 
break from old traditions and establish a centralized body. 
Certain evident changes, however, must be effected in next 
year’s rushing rules. The Constitution of the Council needs re­
vision; the rules need amplification.
Why not introduce the reading of newspapers and maga­
zines by the students as a standard supplement to the subjects 
covered in the college course? This practice should have as its 
objective the training, of students so that they would be able 
to choose good magazines and papers, and to recognize and 
know liow to use the valuable information contained therein.
This requirement could be handled either directly in con­
junction with the subjects covcred in the regular curriculum, 
or as a separate study that would be concerned with familiariz­
ing the students with the use of magazines and periodicals in 
and allied with his course for specific information and the use 
of good newspapers for general information.
With this training, a student should be able to choose a 
good paper and scan quickly the eye-drawing, sensational ar­
ticles which have no permanent value and concentrate his at­
tention on information that would broaden him, such as ad­
vancement in the arts, international affairs, governmental af­
fairs at home, finance, and social development.
Being familiar with and knowing how to use good maga­
zines and periodicals in his field would be an invaluable aid 
in the student’s advancement in the work which he intends 
to follow after graduation.
Many of the professors at school find that knowing how to 
use newspapers and! magazines is an important asset in pre­
paring their subjects. Why couldn’t they pass the knowledge 
along to the students?
THE SURROUNDING WORLD
By JOE ADAMS
THE FIVE YEAR PLAN
Up there on the Volga’s shores 
They had a five year plan 
To put the Soviet on its feet.
On the churches they put a ban. 
They chased the priests into the 
street
Where starving children begged 
for food to eat.
The engines turned and machines 
were made 
But what a price the Soviet paid. 
Their people cry for food 
Parents are torn from their crying 
brood
To go deep into a Siberian mine 
And dig out nature’s gift buried 
'neath the earth.
So that Russia’s credit may once 
more shine.
Many a soul was buried ’neath 
earth
In coldest Siberia’s clime 
Years and years before its time. 
Work, work, work, and save' our 
five-year plan 
Work, work, work, what’s the life 
of one man.
We’ll succeed, wo’ll succeed—just 
watch and see 
Because wo arc free and: Kussia 
our country.
But the pvico seems too great to 
you and mo.
But still wo wonder what the end 
will bo.
aggressive act by either party 
against a third party will terminate 
the treaty. They further agreed 
that neither nation would attempt 
to hinder the trade or commerce 
of the other country and Russia 
promised to withdraw all propa­
ganda in France and its colonies. 
Whether or not this treaty is a 
peace pact or an attempt to try 
and control Europe can not defin­
itely be seen as yet. It is, how­
ever, very doubtful if France would 
ally herself with Soviet Russia 
when the Five Year Plan is so apt 
to not be completed successfully 
on time. Russia claims that it de­
sires peace with all the world and 
yet continually is building up large 
armies.
Russia. Signs A Treaty 
France and Soviet Russia have 
recently signed a pact of concilia­
tion and non-aggression. The 
treaty states that if either party to 
the agreement is the object of ag­
gression by a bird party the second 
party will not aid the aggressor 
nor will either party alone or with 
the aid of a third party retort to 
arms against the other party. An
JAPAN WENT TO CHNA
And Japan called on China once 
again
To make a friendly little call.
Or perhaps for another war cam­
paign
That made Shanhaikwan fall
Into their own possession.
The league declared that it really 
wasn’t fair.
But Nippon’s counsellors replied,
“How can you tell?
Was you dere?’’

Approximately 50 juniors of the 
Department of Mechanical Engi­
neering were taken on an inpsec- 
tion tour through the United States 
Bureau of Mines, Forbes street, on 
Monday afternoon, January 9. The 
students were shown each of the 
different laboratories and research 
departments and were given a 
demonstration and a short talk by 
the person in charge of each.
Dr. Reinhardt Thiesson, who has 
developed a method of cutting coal 
so thin that the slices can be used 
as slides to project pictures on a 
screen, talked to the students 
about coal—what it is made of, its 
properties, and its formation, from 
the early stages as vegetation, to 
its later forms, peat and coal. Dr. 
Thiesson is regarded as an au­
thority on the formation of coal 
because he has studied many sam­
ples with his coal slides. These 
slides make it possible to trace 
back the origin of the sample and 
show the fibrous structure of the 
original vegetable matter.
The students were given a dem­
onstration of the method which 
the Bureau of Mines uses to ana­
lyze at regular intervals the air in 
all kinds of mines all over the 
country.
An interesting experiment was 
performed showing the explosions 
which occur when the mixtures of 
dust or gases in a mine exceed the 
point of safety. How these mix­
tures can be changed so that they 
are perfectly safe was also demon­
strated.
The students were shown a new 
Baume type of apparatus for deter­
mining the calorific value of coal, 
by which about 150 determinations 
a day can be made. A demonstra­
tion wa6 also given of mechanical 
respiratory apparatus and of mine 
rescue equipment.
Holmes Reviews Old 
Cremation Ceremonies
Continued From Page 1
an ancient temple—several cen- 
that o£ a man riding a modern bi­
cycle on which the treads were 
backwards; another artist had re­
corded for the benefit of his 
neighbors, a hold-up in which the 
gangster held a pistol and the vic- 
time rode in a fairly modern model 
of a motor car; and still another, 
prophet had carved several hu- 
turies old. One crude carving was 
mans falling out of rather crude- 
looking airplanes. These uncanny 
drawings appearing in such sur­
roundings, were astounding—but 
only until it was revealed that the 
artists had seen on the mainland 
twentietli-century motion pictures, 
and had carved what they had seen 
in the soft stone walls of an an­
cient temple.
Burton Holmes climaxed his 
screen-story with a picturesque lit­
tle Balinese cremation ceremony. 
When a member of the family die's, 
the body is kept in the house un­
til the family is rich enough to 
have a cremation ceremony. 
"Sometimes they leave grandfather 
in the house for a year, and then 
burn up all their poor relatives 
who have died recently.” The 
Balinese believe that the soul does 
not depart until the body is cre­
mated.
A unique procession accompanies 
the body to the scene of the con- 
ilagration. Among the mourners are 
several artificial black bulls, each 
mounted on a separate platform. 
Upon reaching the “burial" 
grounds, the bulls are turned 
around several times, in order to 
confuse the evil spirits who might 
be contemplating entering the 
grounds where the ceremony is 
taking placo.
When the time has come for the 
cremation itself, the body of the 
dead is deprived of its shrouds— 
which entire process was not ob­
served by the cameraman—and 
the deceased is stuffed inside one 
of the hollow black bulls. The 
pyre is lighted, and the climax of 
the ceremony has been reached.
The climax of Mr. Holmes’ lec­
ture was reached, however, when— 
after the party was all over except 
for a few curious tourists—a na­
tive Balinese coldly stirred the dy­
ing embers of the bull and his con­
tents.
Following which appetizing ac­
tion, the audience returned to the 
campus—and lunch.

IT REALLY HAPPENED—
Swede “Heart” Wentz, the pool and billiard 
king of the dormitories, wound up the Christmas 
vacation period with an unconscious spending 
splurge.
All tired out from chasing around behind the 
eight ball back in good old Spring Grove, he piled 
out of the rattler at East Liberty station and 
stumbled into a waiting cab, mumbled “Car­
negie” in response to the driver’s query and then 
settled back on a set of Mr. Parmelle’s most 
luxurious cush­
ions to surren­
der to the 
arms of Mor- 
pheous. Some 
time later the 
cabby roused 
our w eary 
wanderer from 
his slumber 
and informed
him that they had arrived at their destination, 
Carnegie, Pa./’—whereupon the Swede waxed 
exceeding wroth and informed the cabby con­
cerning his immediate ancestors and his proba­
ble future whereabouts. Then the cabby gran­
diloquently offered to give the Swede a special 
rate to Carnegie Tech, said rate turning out to 
be exactly equal to the regular fare. The sum 
total however was 54.40. Ah, well! Just an­
other show the Swede won’t see.*****
DID YOU KNOW—
That a certain young lady was unduly embar­
rassed when she sent out minutes of Student 
Council with the word Dean spelled “dear.”
That the Friday afternoon matinee of The Vir­
gin Goddess broke up one joint New Year’s reso­
lution. Who cares after Friday anyhow?
That a certain young man about the Commer­
cial department now rates the job of washing 
dishes at the Kloos residence. Ain’t love grand?
Peg Weidlien tells us (believe it or not) that 
she won a beauty prize when she was a baby. 
She promises to bring the clippings from the 
Youngstown papers next time she returns from a 
vacation.
Jerry O’Toole is still holder of the title, “En- 
glebreclit’s champion telephone lover.” Best time 
to date, one hour forty-two minutes.
After a Soph Hop, Jack Stone, John Kronen- 
berg and Lou Jagnow took their dates back to 
P. C. W. only to find the watchman asleep and
the girls locked out. After about 20 minutes 
they finally woke him and goodness knows how 
many more.*****
THE BIG BROADCAST—
Saturday night’s basketball dance furnished 
station WWSW with music for the first Thistle 
Hall broadcast of the year. Walter Sickles, for­
mer Carnegie student who made fame during 
broadcasts of baseball games as O. K. Walter, 
handled the announcing. The usual jolly crowd 
was there—June Fuhs and Kay Burns, Rog Ing­
ham and Honey Meigs, Jean Darsie and Jimmy 
Leonard, Alice Lobaugh and “Moon” McMunn 
(smoke O. G.’s for that cough), and Gladys Hip­
pie and Brad Edelblut.*****
THE SOPHOMORE HOP—
Those that took a chance on Friday the thir­
teenth were more than repaid by the fine music 
of Freddy Bergin and his Vagabonds. Dancing 
couples found Bergin’s music so much to their 
liking that they declared his orcliesti’a one of 
the finest to play in Thistle Hall since this same 
event opened it to the students’ last year.
The plan to have pictures of all the leading 
social events included in this year’s Thistle was 
the occasion for much merriment early in the 
evening. The committee was lined up in front 
of the orches­
tra and a first- 
class exhibi­
tion of mod­
esty was given 
by the entire 
crew. Instead 
of looking like 
a bunch of 
big shot 
Sophs, the 
boys and girls all blushed prettily and smiled 
shyly while the birdie was chirping and the flash­
lights were flashing.
All our leading sophomores were there—George 
Goodridge and Reba Wagner, Ed Rigg, Mary Hus­
band, Patti Littell, Dick Jones, Dick Blair, Rodge 
Burke and Eleanor Elste, Jayne Henderson, 
Nancy McQuade, Elmer Blaisdell, and oodles of 
others.
The parade of famous orchestras started by 
Mr. Bergin goes into its second week this Fri­
day with the renowned Daum-Sanderson outfit 
playing for the Publications Dance in Thistle 
Hall, the only dance of the coming week-end.

Technocrats Claim That Present
Economic System Near Collapse
Technocracy is ttae name of 
group of research engineers work­
ing at Columbia University under 
the direction of Howard Scott. For 
ten years this group has been com­
piling a huge mass of figures and 
charts and have come to the con­
clusion that, unless drastic
changes are made, the present
economic system will possibly col­
lapse.
The data on which Scott based 
his predictions revealed that the 
machine was throwing men out of 
work faster than they could be em­
ployed. A maximum industrial
employment, it is claimed, was 
reached in 1919 ana was lower in 
1929, despite much greater indus­
trial production. To the techno­
crats machine is more necessary 
than man.

Won’t some kind friend tell him 
what to do before it’s too late? What 
he needs is a good pipe and good to­
bacco. Of course, the right tobacco is 
necessary—but that’s easy. A recent 
investigation showed Edgeworth to 
be the favorite smoking tobacco at 
42 out of 54 leading colleges.
And here’s why: Edgeworth isn’t 
just another smoking tobacco. It’s 
an individual blend of fine old hur­
leys. And you’ll'know that difference 
with the first cool puff of Edgeworth.

ing too burdensome for the indus­
trial mechanism; it checks the ma­
chine from producing to the full. 
Debts are “fixed charges,” varying 
little, while income goes up and 
down violently. Technocracy es­
timates that the total of interest- 
bearing debt in the United States 
is about $218,000,000, that the fixed 
charges on this debt amounts to 
more than half the nation’s pres­
ent income, and that this debt has 
been increasing faster than pro­
duction.
One of the tentative proposals 
as a need of this economic system, 
maintains Scott, is a new “money,” 
an exact, invariable token of ex­
change based on energy. Instead 
of frying to value goods in terms 
of dollars of varying purchasing 
power, Technocracy would mea­
sure the enex-gy produced in terms 
of energy units which are theo­
retically exact, similar to foot­
pounds and ergs. The individual 
would receive a proportinate share 
of the energy produced.
Energy is Technocracy’s funda­
mental word. For all the years of 
man’s history until 1800, he used 
the energy resources of the earth 
at about a rate of 2,000 calories 
per day. Then suddenly the ma­
chines came, and today man uses 
about 150,000 calories per capita 
per day. In the meantime man 
did not change materially his 
methods of directing society, or as 
Scott says, the physical science 
out-distance the social science. 
The result has been fluctuations of 
production of goods, depressions, 
and unemployment.

P. & D. Students 
Win Commercial 
Design Awards
A new design class in the Paint­
ing and Decoration department of 
the College of Fine Arts, taught 
by Mr. Alexander Iv. Kostellow, is 
doing some very interesting things 
along the line of industrial design.
Several weeks ago the F. E. I. 
Toothpaste Corporation offered 
prizes for a design of a package 
to contain their tube of toothpaste. 
The judges, Mr. Readio and Mr. 
Kostellow of the P. & D. Depart­
ment and a representative of the 
F. E. I. Corporation, awarded the 
first prize of twenty-five dollars to 
Miss Dorothy Orwig, P. & D., ’35, 
and prizes of five dollars each 
to Charles Dietz, P. & D. ’34, 
and Robert May, P. & D., ’35. The 
same company is sponsoring a pos­
ter contest for their product, to be 
done by students in the sophomore 
illustration class in the P. & D. 
department.
The Westinghouse Electric and 
Manufacturing Company is going 
to execute a mural design done by 
the Industrial Design class. The 
mural is being designed in micarta, 
a new material invented at the 
Westinghouse Company combined 
with colored metals. When com­
pleted the mural will be placed in 
a students’ club room now being 
planned in co-operation with the 
architerctural department by the 
students of the design class. An 
end table which is the work of Isa­
bel Shelton, P. & D. ’35, and 
lamps designed by Dorothy Orwig 
and Isabel Shelton will form part 
of the furnishing of the club room. 
Mr. Kostellow hopes to furnish the 
room completely with articles de­
signed by students in his class. At 
present the class is designing bor­
dered mirrors. The company that 
manufactures tli’e mirrors has 
promised to buy the best designs, 
for use in their factory.

English Ways
By PROF. LEO T. LAWLER
Although the short, choppy sen­
tence—the baby sentence—is not 
in any favor with instructors in 
English composition, we can not 
say the same of the short, ex­
pressive word. The monosyllable 
has al\vays been more favorably 
regarded than any polysyllabic 
relative or synonym—though para­
doxically enough students of Eng­
lish composition, even in the more 
advanced stages of their training, 
continue to write the five or ten 
word sentence, and seek their im­
provement in using the three or 
four syllable word. Their explana­
tion for want of success in present­
ing their ideas in that their vocab­
ulary is limited, and they will 
willingly expend their energies in 
enlarging their word list, even to 
the extent of coining a few terms 
of their own.
This is a mistaken attitude. It 
is that of one who puts the wrong 
thing first, the cart before the 
horse, or the superstructure before 
the foundation is well laid. Such 
a one expects a plant to flower or 
to bear fruit before the roots have 
been carefully planted and atten­
tively nourished. If this one is 
cultivating in the field of accurate 
or artistic expression, it is reason­
able to expect that the development 
of facility in thought transfer will 
be crude and inadequate if roots 
are neglected—and monosyllables 
are the roots of any language.
Among the masters of the knowl­
edge and use of the simple word, 
if authoritive support be needed, 
Milton is preeminent. Random 
passages from any of his English 
poems evidence this perchant. For 
example, the last lines of the son­
net “On His Blindness,” though 
very expressive and moving are 
couched in simple phrases.
Who best
Bear his mild yoke, they serve? 
him best.
His state
So-kingly: thousands at his bid­
ding speed,
And post o’er land and ocean 
without rest;
They also serve who only stand! 
and wait.
In this passage there are few 
words which contain more than one- 
syllable; yet no critic would ven­
ture to say that it was wanting in 
poetic power because of this char­
acteristic.
Furthermore this knowledge of 
root words is prefactory to an 
acquaintance with combinations of 
these words. For example, the- 
words “star” and “board” combined 
give us the word meaning the right, 
side of a ship, and if we are aware' 
of the fact that the steering of a 
ship, in the old days, was from ther 
right side and according to the 
stars we have an appreciation of 
the fuller meaning of “starboard.”’
