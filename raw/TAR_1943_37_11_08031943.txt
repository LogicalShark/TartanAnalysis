Aero Engineers Make Request 
For Separate Seminar Course
Friday, June 30, the Institute of Aeronautical^ Sciences made a propo­
sition to Dr. Jones, requesting that the students taking the Aeronautical 
Option have a separate Seminar Course. The Aero students feel that 
there is enough difference between the Aeronautical and Mechanical En­
gineering options to have a separate Aeronautical Engineering Seminar. 
Therefore, the I. A. S. drew up this petition asking Dr. Jones, the head of 
the College of Engineering, to consider the proposal.
This new seminar will give the Aero students a course more closely 
related to aeionautics. Its introduction into the present course of study 
will not cause any radical changes. According to the proposal of the 
I. A. S., the seminar will be held at the same time as the regular Mechan­
ical Engineering Seminar. The problem of having a faculty member in 
charge of the course has also been
Four Teams To Enter 
Playoffs In Final Week 
Of Mushball Season
solved. Mr. Leroy Olsen, an instruc­
tor in the Mechanical Engineering 
Department, offered to act as the 
faculty member in charge of the 
group.
The Aero students started this 
movement for a new seminar so 
that they may be able to discuss 
subjects more closely related to 
aeronautics, increase the general in­
terest in the course, and better 
background of the future engineers.
The proposal for a separate Seminar 
Course to be given the students taking 
the Aeronautical Option, Mechanical En­
gineering Course.
After careful consideration, the stu­
dents of the Mechanical Engineering De­
partment, Aeronautical Option, hereby 
express their desire for a separate Sem­
inar Course for their option. The prin­
cipal reason for this request is that these 
students feel that their principal fields 
of interest and those of the students tak­
ing the other two Mechanical Engineering 
options differ enough to warrant an Aero­
nautical Engineering Seminar to be sub­
stituted in the Aeronautical Option in 
place of the regular Mechanical Engi­
neering Seminar. As a foundation for the 
organization of the new course, they of­
fer the following suggestions:
1. That an Aeronautical Engineering 
Seminar be offered to the students 
in the Aeronautical Option of the 
Mechanical Engineering Course, and 
that all said students be required to 
take this course. For these students, 
this course would substitute for the 
Mechanical Engineering Course, and 
would be scheduled, for the sake of 
convenience, at the same time as the 
latter course.
2. That sophomores, as well as juniors 
and seniors, be admitted to this 
course, but that the sophomores will 
not be required to submit reports or 
give talks. Attendance would be re­
quired of all sophomores, juniors, and 
seniors in the Aeronautical Option, as 
in other courses in this school.
3. That said course, as with other sem­
inar courses, and in keeping with 
school policy, would carry one unit of 
credit.
4. That the class period be in charge of 
the president of the local (Carnegie 
Institute of Technology) chapter of 
the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences, 
under the guidance of a member of 
the faculty who would act mostly in 
an advisory capacity.
5. That all matters of the course, such 
as programs, extra allowed illegal 
absences, execuses, etc., be handled 
by the Seminar Committee, which 
would be composed of the President 
of the local chapter of the Institute of 
Aeronautical Sciences, the faculty ad­
visor and two students chosen by 
some suitable means. The faculty ad­
visor would act as chairman of this 
committee, and every act of the com­
mittee must bear his apprival.
6. That the general program of the 
seminar course would include talks to 
be delivered by the junior and sen-

This week wound up the second 
go-round of the intramural mushball 
season. B-2, A-l, and Citcom Clan 
were the leaders of leagues I, II, and 
III, respectively. By virtue of their 
win over PiKA, Friday, A-l also be­
came champs of league II for round 
one. The only other team to accom­
plish this feat was Citcom Clan. 
Cameron Hall, league I leaders for 
round one, was far down the list 
with an average of .333. The highest 
average was attained by A-l, with 
a percentage of 1.000.
Monday, a fighting X Team drove 
in 9 runs to the Beta’s 2 to nose 
ahead in the race for fifth place. 
Dan Kahl, the TX hurler, allowed 
the Beta’s only seven hits. B-5 took 
over the Tau Delt’s, 5-2. The Tau 
Delts made a two run rally in the 
seventh inning but couldn’t over­
come the B-5’s lead. Irwin Breier, 
pitcher for the PiKA’s, lead his team 
to a 5 to 1 victory over the SAE’s.
Tuesday, B-3 snowed under Theta 
Xi, 12 to 6. The TX’s were the vic­
tims of multitudinous errors. Cit­
com Clan beat B-5, 4-3, in a close 
pitchers’ battle between Dick Arnold 
and Bob Scott. Another pitchers’ 
battle developed in the Cameron vs. 
B-2 game. After a terrific battle, 
Cameron finally nosed ahead to win, 
2-1. A rampaging B-4 team overran 
a weak Beta Sig team by the sky- 
scraping score of 15-0. Malcolm 
Mattox, the B-4 hurler, held the Beta 
Sigs to 1 hit.
Two teams cinched first place in 
their respective leagues, Wednesday. 
Citcom toppled A-3, 13-7 and A-l 
nosed out A-2 by the score of 6-4. 
These two teams have really proven 
themselves by winning nearly every 
game they have played.
The DU’s took over B-l, 6-5, Tues­
day. But because of an infield fly 
mix-up, the game was replayed 
Thursday, when the DU’s repeated 
their performance, only more so, by 
trouncing the B-l’s, 20-11. Hugh 
Smith of the DU’s hit a home run to 
help his team along.
The big game Friday was the 
play-off of the league II, round one 
championship between A-l and 
PiKA. Steve Gaza of A-l and Irwin 
Breier of the PiKA’s hurled might-

Soldiers Can’t Eat, 
So Class Schedules 
Are Altered To Fit
By action of the Executive Board, 
beginning August 9 all afternoon 
classes (both ASTP and civilian) 
will start at 15 minutes after the 
hour beginning at 1:15, except that 
in individual classes where there 
will be no conflict in regard to in­
structors, students, or rooms it will 
be permissible to start classes on the 
even hour throughout the afternoon. 
Beginning at 1:15, however, all class 
bells will ring at 15 minutes after 
the hour for the beginning of class­
es and at 5 minutes after the hour 
for the end of classes, and all orig­
inal schedules will be made to con­
form to this time.
The reason for this action is that 
since it will be impossible to feed all 
of the ASTP students between noon 
and 1:00 p. m., it is necessary to 
postpone the beginning of the one’s 
o’clock ASTP classes until 1:15. And 
because ASTP and civilian students 
are taught by the same instructors 
and use the same classrooms, it will 
be necessary in general to keep 
ASTP and civilian class hours syn­
chronized in order to avoid con­
flicts.
Theta Tau Initiates 
New Group of Men
Theta Tau, a national profession­
al engineering fraternity held its 
initiation of fifteen new members at 
the Carnegie Union on Monday, 
July 26. Because of circumstances 
brought on by the war, it was de­
cided to call on the prospective 
initiates now instead of waiting un­
til the Spring Carnival when the 
calls are usually made.
The fraternity chooses its mem­
bers by their development in their 
respective fields, personality, char­
acter, and scholarship. The bids 
are given out to eligible sophomores 
and juniors each semester. Those 
selected this semester are: William 
Emerson, Marse Ferrel, Paul Ford, 
Joseph Franz, Paul Gibbian, Adolph 
Glass, William Leone, William

Merle Wolff Elected Head 
Of Publications Committee
Following the resignation of R. K. 
Noyes, Merle Wolff was elected 
Chairman of the Publications Com­
mittee. As such, he will be the com­
mittee’s liason man between it and 
ACAC.
Merle Wolff is a Mechanical En­
gineering sophomore, a Delt, and ex- 
Kiltie Band member, but his pres­
ence on the Publications Committee 
is by virtue of his being Business 
Manager of the TARTAN, a job 
to which he was appointed by 
ACAC.
The Publications Committee is 
composed of the editors and business 
managers of all the Carnegie Tech 
publications, and all publications 
are responsible to it. It is a commit­
tee of ACAC.
Entering Students 
Take Army Course
School To Prepare Men 
For Future ASTP Work
For the first time in Carnegie his­
tory, engineering freshmen will reg­
ister before the end of the regular 
school term, the date being Augdst 
9. Thus the accelerated program is 
being re-accelerated. Instead of the 
present plan of three trimesters a 
year, entering engineering students 
will have four semesters of twelve 
weeks each. The youthful fresh­
men, and youthful they will un­
doubtedly be, seeking the thrills of 
college life for the first time, will 
present quite a contrast to the vet­
eran upperclass men who will be in 
the sleepless process of cramming 
for final exams.
Time is not the only factor under­
going an alteration in the engineer­
ing program. The new curriculum 
bears little resemblance to the for­
mer freshman course, as the admin­
istration has deemed it advisable for 
both army and civilian students to 
take practically the same subjects. 
As a result, entering freshmen’s 
schedule cards will be marked with 
such new subjects as physics reci­
tation, physics lab, geography, his­
tory, and three hours of chemistry 
recitation. English and mathema­
tics will be taught as usual, but so­
cial relations will be completely 
eliminated to make room for the 
new subjects.
Freshmen who expect to have a 
relatively short college career, as 
most entering male students will, 
have the advantage under the new 
course of being up to date with the 
ASTP program; hence any student 
who enters the service and is sent 
to school by the army will be able 
to continue with his education 
where he left off at Carnegie.
Traditions Exam Given 
To Engineering Freshmen
Last Thursday, July 29, one hun­
dred ten freshmen gathered in room 
218, Engineering Hall, to take the 
traditions examination given by the 
Alpha Phi Omega, service frater­
nity. The examination, which con­
tained questions pertaining to Car­
negie songs, cheers, history and or­
ganization, was made out by A.P.O. 
and approved by Dean Murphy. A 
passing grade of 75% or better is 
required for participation in any 
school activities. Inasmuch as the 
first and second semester freshmen 
classes total over two hundred stu­
dents, there were many freshmen 
who did not take the examination. 
These students will be permitted to 
take the traditions examination 
at a later time. Below this article 
are printed three lists: one con­
tains the names of those freshmen 
who passed the examination, an­
other of those who failed and the 
third list of those students who did 
not take the examination but who 
may make it up later.

CJUtosib. A'unckcUn, -----------------------
My Little Jap . . .
A little yellow man put me through this school. I call him my Jap. 
He is sitting in the mikado’s naval training school some twelve thousand 
miles away, but he exerts a beneficial influence on me all through school. 
He is the little man who keeps me working at top speed all the time, and 
never lets me think of slackening off.*****
My Jap is a young almond-eyed V-7 who enlisted about the same time 
I did. He is a dogged persistent little oriental who spends all his time 
studying like a fiend. In his mind is one goal—to sink me. Some day, he 
knows, we will meet in naval combat near some luscious South Sea isle, 
and he doesn’t want to be missing any piece of information. So he never 
misses an assignment, never skims through a lesson, and his notebooks 
are complete and immaculate. He reviews everything he has learned fre­
quently, so that he will have the information at his fingertips when he 
tiies to feed the tunas. Don’t ask me how I know about him. I had a vision 
of him early in the course, and it has never left me.*****
When I am tired of studying the fire control system and I feel I would 
like to knock off for awhile to look at the pictures in “Life,” I suddenly see 
my Jap. He is sitting on a mat in a dormitory, his glasses perched on his 
orange pekoe nose, grimly absorbing the same ordnance assignment 
I am inclined to skip. I go back to my book, and I never do see how drum 
majorettes are training in Texas high schools.*****
Sometimes a bull session down the hall gives off a mellow sussura- 
tion which floats to my ears with the same enchantment the songs of the 
lorelei are said to have had on sailors. My navigation text droops in my 
hands. Then sudden I see my Jap again. His agile yellow hands have com­
pleted a dozen maneuvering board problems, and implanted in his mind is 
the theory of setting a torpedo to steer a colision course with my ship. Up 
comes my Navigation book and the bull session sings siren song no more . . .*****
Does my Jap sound a little like superman to you? Not at all. He just 
hasn’t the devil-may care spirit which is America’s great blessing and its 
failing. You see, ever since he can remember he knew he was going to 
be called upon to sink the white devil, and he never forgts what he is do­
ing. We, on the other hand, are so unused to the idea of battle that we 
rarely correlate some dull ordnance chore with the fateful moment when 
we must all meet our Jap. We tend to get a false perspective, and we forget 
our enemies, the Axis, not the drill department.
* * * * *
So on the whole, I am grateful for my Jap. He gives me no rest and 
he works me to death, but he keeps reminding me what this whole part 
of my life means. If I can help it, he will not get ahead of me. I have 
better facilities, better teachers, and, what is more, I am fighting for true 
freedom, which gives me a tremendous edge on that little yellow weevil. 
When we do meet out there near the South Sea isle, I am pretty sure I am 
going to knock the living daylights out of my Jap. And I won’t be sorry. 
For then and then only, will he let me rest.

This is the story of a little fly. His 
name was Oscar Q. Bothersome, and 
he was very happy flitting from one 
garbage can to another, with some 
stops at odd places to pick up a de­
sert, or a between-meals snack. 
Then, one nice, fine, day, Oscar 
smelled the delicate odor of fresh 
food and followed it faithfully like 
a radio beam almost to its source. 
We say almost, because he ran 
smack dab into a bunch of mesh 
wire which men call a screen. In­
side Oscar could see a whole lot of 
human beings, genus Collegian 
Techitus, eating all the food which 
Oscar would have prized most high­
ly like caviar, and they were eating 
it as though it were nothing — in 
fact, some of them even ate it as 
though they didn’t like it!
Well, Oscar scouted the entire 
building, but no way was shown by 
which he could gain entrance. But 
one day, Oscar discovered a human 
being in the act of a mistake. This 
young lady, one of the people who 
serve in such places, opened a win­
dow, and Oscar tried to gain en­
trance; guess what—no screen! Os­
car raced like a bolt of lighting to 
track down the sweetish smell and 
made the fastest landing ever re­
corded in the Honorable Brother­
hood of Dishonorable Flies, Fleas, 
and Mosquitos on a veritable sea of 
sweet stuff, which humans call 
frosting.
Oscar filled himself up, then rac­
ed out to get cousin Joe, who imme­
diately organized an army of broth­
ers, sisters, cousins, aunts, uncles, 
and love-flies to conquer this land 
flowing with milk, honey, frosting, 
and garbage. On they droned, more
powerful than any fleet of bombers, 
carrying their deadly charge of 
germs, and with their own terrific 
nuisance value. Down they drove 
on the helpless Carnegie Grill, the 
most powerful air force ever or­
ganized. And when they hit, they 
found the place less defended than 
Pantelleria, or the Main Street mud 
puddle. All the windows were open, 
including the many which had no 
screens. Veni, vidi, vici, (in fly 
language, buzz, zabuzz, zuzzuzz) for 
the conquering army. The only 
hazard now to their misdeeds is the 
danger that they will wait too long 
and disappear down some human’s 
throat. Every day the flies eat all 
the best food right out of the hu­
man beings’ mouths, and even be­
fore it reaches there in many cases.
Now you know why the flies are 
so thick in the Carnegie Grill—be­
cause they insist on opening the 
windows without screens. But the 
sad note to this sad tale is that Os­
car died. They made him a hero for 
his work, but one day he landed on 
a piece of bread and was trapped 
because it disappeared down inside 
the toaster before he knew what 
was happening. Alas and alack! 
Poor Oscar.
A wife stands nobly by a lad,
While he is sadly harried 
By troubles he would never had
If he had never married.
He always had the final word,
But that was scarcely queer;
That final word you may have 
heard;
“Yes, dear; yes, dear; yes, dear.”

Upon browsing through last 
week’s TARTAN, I found the usual 
situation prevailing. There were 
many requests for the opinions of 
th estudent body upon various sub­
jects, and I have never seen any of 
the answers to these requests pub­
lished except in the Letters to Editor 
column. Therefore I am now pre­
pared to extend my neck in offering 
my own opinions.
On page one of the July 29 issue, 
the question is raised of dropping 
^rmy-civilian sport competition. 
Personally, I feel that, in view of 
the results in the softball league, 
they should be discontinued. It 
seems that only two civilian teams 
in the whole school were able to 
even hold their own. Although the 
question of maturity and ability en­
ters into it, the main issue is man­
power. While each platoon has at 
its command fifty men in good 
health, the struggling fraternity has 
to use nearly all of its ten or twelve 
men to form a team, even if some 
of the members are not inclined to­
ward the sport.
Secondly, the idea of Tech having 
a football team from its present cur­
riculum is ridiculous. The schedule 
to which the engineers have been 
subjected recently would wear on 
the nerves of any human being alive,
and to expend the time and effort 
to have any kind of a successful 
team seems to me to be entirely out 
of the question.
Thirdly, what in the world has 
ever happened to a school social pro­
gram I don’t know. With two 
scheduled dances during the entire 
semester, the place seems even more 
than usual like a reformatory.
One bright spot is the improve­
ment of the TARTAN. It has really 
come along this semester, due pro­
bably to a dynamic ad-man.
Finally, and the thorn that stabs 
the deepest: No doubt it is just a
practical joke or something, but 
whoever the moron was who 
thought of giving us FIVE DAYS 
vacation at the end of this semester, 
he’d better take another look at our 
schedules. Just about when I 
started to figure that I could stick 
out the school and beat this rap, this 
idea of a three day vacation comes 
up. Any man who lived further 
than Greensburg can hardly make it 
home and back in that time! That 
may satisfy some, but anyone who 
sees me around here Thursday after 
having gruelling finals right up to 
the end of the previous week, is 
hereby invited to kick me, because 
I’ll be under the influence.
Sincerely,
Thos. Bokman.

TUESDAY, AUGUST 3, 1943THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
*7<4e KiâcfUe Kasi Klan
The Kiddie Kar Klan is here. We 
spent all high school trying to catch 
up with ourselves, and now they do 
this to us. What does a prof say to 
the average student who pulls some 
infantile trick? “Act your age.” 
Not so with the prematures. We 
have to act more than our age, and 
we’re not always successful at it. 
“Sweet sixteen and never been 
kissed.” We’re sour sixteen and 
never got dry behind the ears.
Life is easy at sixteen. Just 
breeze along and let enjoyment fill 
your soul. No worries, no problems, 
no real live situations. Well, we’re 
neither fish nor foul. Chronolog­
ically we’re high-school juniors. 
Mentally they tell us we’re college 
freshmen. Socially we’re in the 
well-known situation described as 
“up creek.” This gives rise to three 
basic problems—studies, older en­
gineers, and girls. Starting with the 
most interesting—no, better start 
with studies.
School work should be a snap. 
Since we’re up to it mentally every­
thing is taken care of. The trouble 
is that studies are inexorably mixed 
with other things, notably sleep. 
When you move upstairs you’re not 
supposed to need much. I hear you 
don’t get it. Anyway, freshman 
year is providing good practice. The 
difficulty is that we need not eight 
but ten hours a night for top effi­
ciency. Every once in a while things 
pile up, and we sit with drooping 
eyelids adding a spare hundred 
words to an English composition or 
pouring over McCully. Next day 
the work is done, but the “premey” 
is done in. Why do you think the 
sympathetic chem instructor tells 
us to sleep quietly, please, in lec­
ture. The poor kids just can’t take 
it.
Of course the profs love us. Either 
we are too timid to speak up in class 
or we run at the mouth and nobody 
can stop us. Psych department must 
be happy, though. Lots of nice sub­
jects for adolescent psychology 
study, and paying for the privilege, 
too. Athletics work out fine. Not 
only are we too young to tangle 
safely with the soldiers, we’re not 
old enough to be much good on the 
teams. That’s one place they have 
been forced to accept us, however.
We seem to be down to girls. How 
did they ever sneak in, anyhow?

“The queens are not for you, Plebe.” 
Neither are the lemons. Who could 
be for us? We’re high-school jun­
iors. Who can we date? High- 
school sophomores. Have a fine 
time, too, until something inside us 
starts saying “Here you are, a fresh­
man at Tech. You’re supposed to 
rate. It sure looks like it. Cradle 
robbing, eh?” About now the fun 
ends. A fifteen-year old girl does 
seem rather young. Naturally we’re 
far too sophisticated for that.
Next stop. Juniors and seniors. 
It doesn’t matter that they are older 
than we are; we have fun. Only 
trouble is, maybe they don’t. Still 
that horrible voice Saying “You’re 
a college man now. Ought to be 
playing for bigger stakes.” Nice to 
think about the next time some girl 
throws you over for a senior in her 
own school who never heard of 
C-701 but manages his own social 
relations all right.
Last chance. College girls. There 
are only a few freshmen girls on 
campus, which makes things diffi­
cult. Any “premey” who knows his 
place says “Miss” to one of the ven­
erable babes on the expedited pro­
gram at Maggy Murph. The logical 
source of woman-power for the en­
gineers, and the Klan finds itself 
hopelessly outclassed. They can do 
circles around us in studies, and 
we’re mere babes in arms to them 
socially. “Remember, they’re 999 
other girls on campus.” That doesn’t 
help us much. Bring on the fall 
term, and then maybe you can hold 
back the dawn for some Klansman 
for a better reason than a late de­
scrip plate. The girls will still be 
eighteen, but there will be more of 
them. Too bad this two-year defer­
ment stuff had to go through. It 
looked as though we would come 
into our own through the law of 
supply and demand. The A.S.T.P.

so some technical motion pictures. 
Programs and talks should be ar­
ranged and selected so as to give a 
broader viewpoint on all fields, es­
pecially those related to aeronatutics, 
and in a manner which will create 
general interest in the course and the 
subject matter of the talks.
7. That attendance at certain meetings 
of the Institute of Aeronautical Sci­
ences, with the approval of the ad­
visor, will count for an extra allow­
able illegal absence from the seminar 
period.
As closing suggestions, the students of 
the Aeronautical Option give: 
that Mr. Leroy Olsen, an instructor in
doesn’t help, either. Those dear 
boys, all over-qualified Casanovas 
at heart, send us right back to the 
high school again.
There used to be some consolation. 
We only looked forward to two 
years of problems, and then they 
were all solved. Now the War Man­
power Commission had to go and 
make us keep up the masquerade 
another year. Pity the poor prema­
ture. He may buy Esquire, but it’s 
only for the dog pictures. Nobody 
loves him. Even so, there’s still 
A-12. Maybe we can be over-quali­
fied Casanovas too.
the Mechanical Engineering Depart­
ment, has said that he would be will­
ing to act as the faculty member in 
charge of such a course, and 
that every five weeks, they suggest, the 
Mechanical and Aeronautical sem­
inars would “trade” their best pro­
grams, so that the fields of interest 
of the two groups will be held in 
closer alliance, without making them 
one and the same, which the students 
consider one of the bad points of the 
present set-up.
The only way to keep really cool 
in summer, according to Dr. George 
Morse, Medical Director of M.I.T., 
is to go to Newfoundland, but there 
are several ways to keep more com­
fortable and keep going right at col­
lege. Wear light clothes, he says, 
try to avoid overheating. Get plenty 
of sleep, or at least as much as you 
can.
At Tech it’s easier to go to New­
foundland.

us that that comes to .09 women for

Darn it, we’re still trying to 
think of an answer.

TUESDAY, AUGUST 3, 1943THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
one of the profs
Every Tuesday and Thursday 
morning, promptly at 10 A. M., Pro­
fessor Max Shoen makes a very in­
formal appearance before one of his 
two freshman social relations 
classes. Dressed in loose-fitting but 
neat clothes, Dr. Shoen makes you 
feel at home immediately as he 
brings up the topic of discussion for 
the class. After listening to him for 
a few minutes and watching his in­
tent facial expression, you begin to 
wonder who the man is, and what 
sort of schooling contributed to his 
unusual success as an educator.
The story is a simple one. Born 
in Austria in 1888, he came to this 
country at the age of fourteen. He 
entered grammar school and com­
pleted it in two years. Next, he at­
tended the College of the City of 
New York, where he specialized in 
languages and mathematics. As a 
boy, Dr. Shoen spoke Hungarian, 
Slovak, Hebrew, and German flu­
ently, German being his native 
tongue. After completing courses 
at C. C. N. Y., Professor Shoen went 
to Iowa State where he obtained his 
doctorate. He was a research asso­
ciate there and became a member of 
Sigma Xi fraternity.
His start In the teaching profes­
sion was at a high school in Chata- 
nooga, Tennessee, then as director 
of music at the Eastern Tennessee 
State Normal School, later taught 
French and German, and finally 
came to Carnegie Tech—but not as 
a social relations teacher. The so­
cial relations course as we know it 
in its present form is quite new, a 
course which Dr. Shoen had much 
to do with in developing. At first 
engineering students were not the 
only ones taking the course—in those 
days Maggy Murphs as well as Fine 
Arts took what was known as ethics.
Being in a talkative mood, and be­
ing in the presence of a man who 
can discuss almost anything with a 
tone of authority, the natural out­
come of your reporter’s interview 
was a discussion, one on Tech stu­
dents in general. Lacking today, 
according to Dr. Shoen, is the in­
tellectual spirit of a year ago, when 
the student pursuing the social re­
lations course strived for something 
deeper than a mere surface knowl­
edge of the subject. Freshmen are
. . . Prof Max Shoen
far more alert in classrooms than are 
upperclassmen. As students pro­
gress in years, they seem to retro­
gress in intellectual spirit, (un­
quote)
Dr. Shoen has a variety of inter­
ests which keeps him busily en­
gaged. He is a lover of languages, 
has written Psychology of Music, 
and lying opened to the middle and 
on his desk was a book of Greek es­
says. As you enter his office on the 
right, you see a massive bookcase 
with such volumes as A History of 
Aesthetics, Man’s Way. and Art for 
High School Students. One last 
word with Dr. Shoen before I left 
was to secure an anecdote from him. 
It seems his favorite story is the one 
about the woman student who, after 
taking a semester with Dr. Shoen,

Hugh Smith, better known as 
“Tiger” Smith for his scrappy bas­
ketball playing, is one of the most 
outstanding men on campus. Blond, 
good-looking, tanned Hugh indulges 
in such activities as Tau Beta Pi, 
treasurer of Pi Tau Sigma, presi­
dent of The American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers, president of 
Interfraternity Council, president of 
his fraternity, Delta Upsilon, and a 
member of the Interhonorary Coun­
cil. “Tiger” is well known on the 
sports field and his earned two var­
sity letters in basketball and two as 
captain of the track team. This 
flashy playing on the D. U. intra­
mural mushball team is also worth 
mentioning. Besides all these ac­
tivities, he maintains a 3.18 factor in 
Mechanical Engineering in which he 
is a senior.
Hugh, you might say, was rail­
roaded into going to Tech by his 
father who personally knew one of 
the faculty members, and at first 
he disliked the school and his course. 
Between his sophomore and junior 
years, however, he worked for a 
year at the Goodricn Company, and 
it was during that time that he be­
came interested in his course and 
realized the advantages of Carnegie 
Tech. Hugh believes that everyone 
should work for a time in the type 
of work that relates to his particular

As far as women goes, he has no 
definite preference as long as they
are beautiful, but he usually ends 
up with a blond. Incidentally, his 
steady now is a blond.
Hugh is an ardent dancer, smooth 
or jitterbug with emphasis on 
smooth, and he believes that Glenn 
Miller is tops as far as bands go. 
What irks him most is the lack of 
versatility of Tech students. He be­
lieves that the students should enter 
into more activities instead of leav­
ing this sort of thing to a few. Hugh 
will graduate in December and 
hopes to get into the Navy.
Delving into conversation and in­
terests of college students, Prof. Paul

themselves than anything else, al­

fore.

Dear Editor:
Thé question that has been toss­
ed around campus lately is: Should 
the soldiers play civilians touch 
football t As far as the soldiers are 
concerned, they would like to con­
tinue their intramural activities. 
Why not? It gives them outside 
contact with students at Tech, a 
trait that has been more and more 
noticeably lacking here on campus.
The physical contact of touch 
football is nothing to compare with 
tackle. Touch football mainly con­
cerns running and passing. Blocking 
is limited, except for faintly slow­
ing down the boys who always 
charge the line to wôrry the passer. 
In touch football, the ball has to 
change hands at least once behind 
the line of scrimmage in the form of 
a lateral or a reverse. Power plays 
are impractical because the opposi­
tion merely has to touch the carrier 
to down the ball. Yardage that 
means anything is gained by pass­
ing.
The rumor that the soldiers are so 
larger than the civilian students is 
mainly fictitious. Certainly you can 
always find some soldiers who are 
bigger than some civilians. But as 
far as that goes it is just as possible 
to find students larger than the sol­
diers. The main action in touch 
football takes place around passing 
where physical contact is at a mini­
mum and running and quick think­
ing are at a maximum. Injuries will 
not be any more common in touch 
football than in a good game of 
mushball. If it is possible to crack 
a rib in football, it is just as possi­
ble to twist an ankle, to stove a 
finger, or get conked with a bat in 
softball. That the civilian student 
will be able to play is certain. It is
up to the army whether the soldiers 
will have time for it. They have 
time for softball. Let’s have sol­
dier-civilian football.

ily, allowing only 7 and 5 hits, re­
spectively. The score remained 0-0 
until the seventh inning, when the 
first baseman, Arthur Boss of the 
A-l’s slugged out a home run with 
two men on. The B-2’s gained first 
place in league III by overwhelming 
the DU’s, 5-1.
A week ago, Saturday, B-4 took 
over B-2, 8-4, mainly because of the 
unfortunate weakening of Anderson, 
the B-2 pitcher, who walked three 
men in a row at a crucial moment 
in the game. The B-l’s slaughtered 
the Beta Sigs, 17-6, but the gallant 
Beta Sigs, lead by hurler Sy Corwin, 
stuck it out to score, in all but two 
innings.
Games that remain to be played 
include a game between B-2 and 
Cameron Hall to determine the all- 
time champion of league I, and play­
offs between league leaders to de­
termine the school champion.
The unsung heroes of the mush­
ball intramurals were the two men 
that organized the entire show: Gail

zation so that it would run smooth­

success; it not only furnished fun

TUESDAY, AUGUST 3, 1943THE CARNEGIE TARTAN7
Is The Faculty Getting Lazy?
by Chuck Peterson, Sports Editor
In previous years, it used to be the 
custom to have an annual mushball 
game between the faculty and the 
senior students. However, for some 
reason or another, this hotly contest­
ed game has been dropped from the 
books. Is the faculty getting too 
lazy to play or are the faculty men 
getting too old to play ball any 
more. I’m blaming the faculty for 
the fact that this interesting con­
test was dropped because, in my 
opinion, the students would never, 
of their own accord, drop this ex­
cellent chance to prove that they 
are not entirely inferior to the Pro­
fessors.
Is the faculty getting lazy? I 
don’t know, but something is def­
initely wrong. The caliber of the 
faculty ball players has not decreas­
ed from that of former years, in fact, 
if anything, it has increased in the 
past year, with the addition of many 
young teaching assistants to sup­
plement Professor Neeley of the 
Math Department, who used to be 
a professional, Mr. Moses, and Mr. 
Murphy, all excellent ball players. 
With such an abundance of faculty 
talent, why not have a game be­
tween these two groups this year?
Of course since the senior enroll­
ment is so small this year it might 
be hard to get an entirely senior 
team on the field, but the effect 
would be the same if the team were 
composed of seniors and juniors. 
However it should be easy to get 
an entirely senior team if a concen­
trated attempt were made. The sen­
iors in the Metallurgy Department 
have demonstrated this with em­
phasis, for in that one department 
they have organized a team which 
has had weekly games with their 
faculty. Thus it can be seen that 
the seniors should have no difficulty 
in organizing a team, and the same 
goes for the faculty. Let’s have this 
game before the end of this semes­
ter and prove that this campus is not 
dead.
Apology to the Physical Department
In my editorial last week I made 
several statements which infered 
that I was quoting the Physical De­
partment, which I had no authority 
to do, as I had not spoken to any 
member of that department before I
wrote that article. I wish to apolo­
gize for the inference even though I 
truthfully did not intend for those 
statements to be interpreted as 
quotations. However I still feel that 
an Intramural Touch Football com­
petition would not be injurious to 
either the Army’s physical program 
or the civilian’s physical welfare. 
Predictions on the Mushball Finals
When the soldiers come back to 
school next Monday, the Finals will 
be run off to determine the school 
champion. As things stand now, the 
First Platoon of Company A and 
Citcom Clan are the winners of the 
Second and Third Leagues respect 
fully. Both of these teams breez­
ed into those championships, win­
ning both rounds without to much 
difficulty, and therefore have prov­
ed without too much difficulty, and 
therefore have proved themselves to 
be teams of exceptional caliber. In 
League I, however, Cameron Hall 
won the first round while B-2 won 
the second. These two teams will 
have to have a playoff contest to 
determine the final winner in that 
round. I pick B-2 to win that game 
due to Cameron’s decided slip this 
second half. In the final playoff, I’ll 
take Citcom, whose steady dependa­
bility ought to stand out over the 
oft-times flashy playing of the two 
Army teams. •
Intramural Board
The Intramural Board has decid­
ed to drop any ideas of having any 
ideas about having outdoor volley­
ball competition this summer due 
to the fact that there are already too 
many activities running concurrent­
ly to have a satisfactory competi­
tion. Tennis has been dropped un­
til the Board deems it advisable to 
reconsider running the matches. 
This was due to the virtual impossi­
bility of working it into the Army 
schedule.

week, but, weather permitting, the 
final matches will be played this 
week.
Jack Hugus, seeded number four 
in the singles division, defeated Bill 
Wolfe, 6-3, 6-0, to enter the semi­
final round. The weatherman inter­
rupted Bill Lankford and Leon For­
man twice in their match to decide 
who is to enter the final round. Play 
was halted the second time with 
Lankford leading in the third set, 
2-0. Lankford had won the first set,
6-2, and Forman had taken the sec­
ond set, 7-5. Frank Showman will 
play Hugus this week for the right 
to play the winner of the Lankford- 
Forman match.
In the doubles division, Nelesen 
and Showman, the number one seed­
ed combination, defeated Griffen

8THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, AUGUST 3, 1943
The Tartan Presents ...
The Oak Hall Infirmary
Three Army men are now sleep­
ing in a girls’ dormitory. Oak Hall, 
the lucky dorm, has provisions for 
thirty-five, although the number 
has never exceeded eight. Don’t all 
rush at once; its the ASTP in­
firmary. Oak was chosen because 
it was used for the same thing six 
years ago, before Tech had hospital­
ization. Men with minor illnesses 
and convalescents are sent there, 
usually for three or four days, the 
first two in bed and the last up and 
around. Dr. Rike, school physi­
cian, Mrs. Wray, house mother, for­
merly of Birch Hall, and four 
nurses care for the patients.
One of the most remarkable 
things about the infirmary is the 
lack of hospital atmosphere. The 
double-jointed beds, a little tray of
medical supplies and a bed- 
stradling tray are the only remind­
ers that this is, after all, a hospital. 
Men make the infirmary, so let’s see 
how they live.
A pile of magazines a foot high is 
exhausted every day. The reading 
matter was quite varied: U. S. Cam­
era, comic books, two Esquires, 
Time, Click, Fortune for March ’42, 
Fun in Bed, and the Readers Digest. 
A double deck of cards stood un­
used on the table, because the only 
fellow who played was sick of soli­
taire.
The Red Cross donated a radio, 
which supplies some entertainment, 
but letter writing, reading, sleeping, 
and the like occupy most of the 
time. Just to make things clubby, 
one was draped over two chairs
in the confines of the Oak Hall infirmary. Chief gripe of the soldiers is the 
vamperinq they get in this form, but secretly they love it.
reading. Asked how he liked the 
place, he answered “Nice change 
from studies. Too bad it had to come 
during furlough.” The other two 
hastened to say that he was new 
there and couldn’t appreciate it yet.
One of them expressed a rather 
different opinion.
“Sooner I get out the better. You 
go crazy in here. They are too nice 
to us . . . They kill you by resting 
you.” While this was going on they 
dropped in and out of chairs and 
generally showed nQ concern for 
bed. One raced to the window, and 
nounced “Martin B-26’s.” I guess 
the boys just want to get the job 
done so they can start fighting. They 
don’t know when they’re well off.
It isn’t everywhere in the- Army 
they give you your meals in bed, 
send in a pretty brunette to hold Dr. Rike serves thè entire school,
your hand (if only she didn’t stick soldiers and all. Too bad such a nice
that darn thing in your mouth), do man has to have such a job — it
your work for you, and pay you doesn’t help one’s social contact
for it. with the school, exactly.
Sergeant Meatball Announces Discovery of 
Ytterbium Wumbus Gumbus, Wonder Drug
It’s awful! Here I sit without an 
idea in the world. I thought 
about everything from reprinting a 
sweet fantasy plagiarized from the 
Purdue Exponent to submitting my 
late English theme, a swell little 
number dealing with how one would 
go about preparing jerkade by the 
Moskowitz method.
It just won’t work. Nothing ever 
happens these days of any import­
ance to the populace. However, a 
brilliant young mess sergeant, Jose 
Meatball by name, has evolved an 
amazing process for the commercial 
production of Ytterbium Wumbus 
Gumbus. Now ordinarily this 
would be apt material for the Tech­
nical, but wartime exigencies neces­
sitate the prompt dissemination of 
formula YtWumGum (Ytterbium 
Wumbus Gumbus) for the benefit of 
the United Toadstools of the World.
Well, folks, your worries are over. 
YtWumGum taken in small doses 
will keep a human being in tiptop 
shape indefinitely. In addition it is 
one of the best substitutes for ersatz 
rubber yet discovered. It’s good for 
rheumatism, anarchronism, and hay 
fever. It's wunnderrfulll-1-1 stuff, 
honist.
Just for an example, listen to this 
display of YtWumGum’s prowess. 
Several weeks ago Dr. Meatball’s
experimental plane made a forced 
landing on a remote Alaskan lake, 
completely from out of the gesstank. 
Meatball decided to attempt a prac­
tical demonstration of his brain­
child, so he dropped two and a four­
teenth milliliters of YtWumGum in­
to the tank, and left things percolate 
for a couple of hours. Meanwhile 
weather took a hand, and froze the 
lake over, impaling the pontoons in 
thirty feet of solid ice. (It’s true, 
gospel truth in fact) Well, Dr. Meat­
ball revved up the motor, cracked 
the lake completely off from the 
banks, gained altitude, and zoomed 
away, carrying millions of cubic 
yards of ice along with him.
Naturally, Meatball had to get rid 
of this extra weight. So he took off 
at 800 miles per hour for drought 
and famine-ridden Southern Siberia. 
And do you know that when the ice 
melted over Southern Siberia, not 
only was the drought permanently 
licked and a well-devolped drain- 
are system immediately begun, but 
the people were able to salvage 
enough fish to supply their region, 
Tibet, and Afghanistan with fresh 
and salted fin’sears for two years.
Sorry that there isn’t any more 
room, dear readers, but perhaps 
next week the formula ytWumGum 
will find its way into the TAR­
TAN’S sanctum sanctorum.
The nurse takes care of the records, but the boys wish she could take 
more care of them. Not that they’re neglected—its just that they enjoy 
the presence of the opposite sex, even in a hospital.
