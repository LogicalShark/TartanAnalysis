Architecture professor 
appears on Jeopardy
Hill residents play 'Assassins’ game
Assistant professor of architecture Pablo Garcia came within $1 of 
winning NBC’s game show Jeopardy.
NICK GUESTO
Staffwriter
One of Carnegie Mellon’s 
own professors was a con­
testant last Friday on NBC’s 
Jeopardy. Pablo Garcia, an 
assistant professor in the 
School of Architecture, was 
one of the three players on 
the game show.
After trying out for the 
game back in 1999 and not 
advancing to Los Angeles to 
film the show, Garcia decided 
to give it another shot a de­
cade later. Currently, much of 
the application process is on­
line. When Garcia tried out, 
the application was made up 
of 50 questions in 50 catego­
ries to be answered in only 
eight minutes. Any of the 
applicants correctly answer­
ing 35 or more questions au­
tomatically advanced to the 
next round in New York.
There, all qualifiers par­
ticipated in a mock version 
of the game. According to 
Garcia, at this level, winning 
was less important than in 
other rounds. Instead, it was 
crucial for producers to ob­
serve potential contestants’ 
interactions with the game. 
The reasoning for this, Gar­
cia said, is so that producers 
know a potential contestant’s 
online test “wasn’t a fluke.”
After competing in New 
York, Garcia’s next step was 
to wait. Eventually, Garcia re­
ceived a call asking him to be 
in Los Angeles in three weeks 
to film an episode of the 
show. Thus, for the next three 
weeks, Garcia read trivia and 
watched past Jeopardy epi­
sodes in order to learn about
the style of questions asked.
Garcia traveled to Culver 
City, Calif., to appear in an 
episode of the show. Upon 
arrival, Garcia was surprised 
to be taken via shuttle to the 
Sony Pictures Studio, which, 
to Garcia, looked very simi­
lar to a warehouse. Garcia 
remarked on the building’s 
modest exterior, a definite 
contrast to the Jeopardy 
stage, which he described as 
“a very shiny place.” Garcia 
was also surprised by the size 
of the video screen that holds 
the game’s 30 clues. He said 
that each box is a 30-inch 
flat-screen TV, which, when 
six rows of six are stacked on 
top of each other, created a 
nicely-sized viewing board.
When it was his turn to 
compete, Garcia found the 
pace of play to be very rapid. 
It took only 40 minutes to 
film a 22-minute episode, and 
questions are asked one after 
the other in a seemingly end­
less string of miscellaneous 
trivia.
Garcia described his 
match as a back-and-forth 
battle between him and his 
main competitor, Elizabeth 
Galoozis, a 27-year-old refer­
ence librarian. Garcia’s third 
competitor, Lisa Dengate, 
held a score that remained 
far below those of Garcia and 
Galoozis. Each time Galoozis 
fell behind, she would catch 
back up to Garcia again by 
acing a Daily Double. Again, 
after Garcia went on a brief 
winning streak, Galoozis 
answered several questions 
correctly as well. This cycle

College is a transition period 
after which children become 
adults, but during college, stu­
dents are caught in an in-between 
state. They have the intelligence 
and ambitions of adults, but the 
imaginations and energies of 
children. They want to play like 
children and work like adults 
simultaneously. This results in 
students taking to childhood pas­
times with childhood purpose 
while maintaining the focused 
intensity of a career.
This phenomenon was ar­
guably manifested during the 
intense opening weekend of a 
game of Assassins on the Hill.
Assassins is a live-action game 
in which participants use mock 
weapons — in this case plastic 
spoons — to “kill” other players 
by hitting them*in the back or 
neck. Each player has a target 
that he or she must assassinate, 
and after one assassinates the 
target, one then moves on to the 
target’s target. This process goes
on until there is only one player 
left alive. As such, at any point 
in the game, each player has ex­
actly one assassin attempting to 
kill them and, simultaneously, a 
second player whom they must 
assassinate. Players can defend 
against their own assassins by 
hitting them with a spoon, which 
“stuns” the assassin and gives the 
player immunity for one hour. 
Some areas, such as classrooms 
and restrooms, are also consid­
ered safe zones where players are 
not allowed to kill each other.
“By Feb. 20 [the day it start­
ed], we had 47 people signed 
up. The first deadline for killing 
the first target was Wednesday 
the 24th. By then, 33 of the 47 
people playing had already been 
assassinated,” said first-year gen­
eral MCS major Keyan Sadeghi, 
who is hosting the game.
Though the game is time-con­
suming, the rules stress that it is 
ultimately just a game — mak­
ing it ideal for college campuses. 
As of the time of writing, H&SS 
first-year Christopher Sparks and

ties scholar Chelsea Hulse 
are tied for the most kills at 
five.
“Getting kills was easy 
because people post so 
much stuff on Facebook....
I had no trouble find­
ing an image some­
where of who I 
was after,” said 
Sparks. “The 
circle of friends 
also matters a lot 
because there are 
some people you 
just can’t avoid....
Trusting them as 
they trust you is just 
a less stressful way to 
go. In return, they can 
help you spot your tar­
get and protect you as 
needed.”
But for all of Sparks’ 
preparation and strategy, his. 
assassin, Hulse, actually had 
little intention of killing him 
initially.

“How many of you have 
used HeLa cells in your re­
search?” The soft-spoken voice 
of Rebecca Skloot fell upon the 
audience as professionals and 
students rustled to get a look 
at those in the audience who 
responded to the question.
The Immortal Life of Hen­
rietta Lacks is a biographical, 
bioethical account of both 
writer Rebecca Skloot and the 
family of Henrietta Lacks, or 
HeLa. Together they search 
for answers, answers that
concern science and human­
ity alike. Lacks’ story opens a 
discussion about the rights of 
patients and their consent for 
tissue donation to research.
With these issues in mind, 
Lacks’ children followed the 
author into the realm of sci­
ence for questions left unan­
swered about their mother 
and her cells.
“I remember when Debo­
rah [Lacks’ daughter] visited 
Dr. Christoph Lengauer’s labo­
ratory to see her mother’s cells 
for the first time,” said the au­
thor. Chapter 32 reads, “Chris­
toph reached into the freezer
behind him, grabbed another 
vial of HeLa cells, and held it 
out to Deborah.... ‘She’s cold,’ 
Deborah said.... She raised 
the vial and touched it to her 
lips. ‘You’re famous,’ she whis­
pered. ‘Just nobody knows 
it.’”
HeLa cells were first ex­
tracted in 1951 from Lacks 
when she came in for cancer 
treatment at Johns Hopkins 
Hospital in the “color ward” 
in payment for free medical 
consultation. The book cover 
reads, “Doctors took her cells 
without asking. Those cells 
never died.” HeLa is the first 
human immortal and com­
mercialized cell line. As long 
as HeLa cells are provided 
with fundamental nutrients 
and optimal cell conditions, 
they will continue to divide 
an unlimited number of times. 
“They helped with some of the 
most important advances in 
medicine: the polio vaccine, 
chemotherapy, cloning, gene 
mapping, in vitro fertiliza­
tion,” reads the prologue of 
The Immortal Life of Henrietta 
Lacks.
HeLa travels across moun­
tains, countries, and genera­
tions of researchers, even at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Maggie Braun, assistant 
department head of the bio­
logical sciences department, 
raised her hand during Sk- 
loot’s lecture to discuss the 
use of HeLa cells.
“I previously worked with 
[HeLa cells] at the National 
Institute of Health using them

Carnegie Mellon professor, alumni collaborate to develop garden
Tommy Hofman/Photo Staff
One Mile Garden was created by Carnegie Mellon art professor Bob Bingham as a community initiative in 
York, Ala., in order to address issues such as starvation and unemployment in the area.
ALEXANDRA RIEDL
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon professor 
of art Bob Bingham, in collabo­
ration with Carnegie Mellon 
alumni Robin Hewlett and Ally 
Reeves, has created One Mile 
Garden, a community initiative 
in York, Ala. One Mile Garden 
will provide residents with op­
portunities for education and 
better health. The creators will 
work with locals to establish 
garden sites and to develop a 
program for growing healthy 
food.
One Mile Garden was cre­
ated in collaboration with the 
Coleman Center for the Arts in 
downtown York. Shana Berger, 
the co-director of the Cole­
man Center, initially contacted 
Bingham with the intent of 
collaborating on a community 
agriculture program. Berger
had viewed Bingham’s web­
site and was impressed by his 
2005 “We Grow” project. “We 
Grow,” based in the Home- 
wood-Brushton neighborhood 
in Pittsburgh’s East End, is a 
community-based program 
that encourages the creative 
use of vacant land for sustain­
able agriculture.
Though initially skeptical, 
Bingham was quickly won over 
by the prospect of creating a 
project to address issues such 
as starvation and unemploy­
ment in York. “She enticed 
me to go to Alabama to do a 
residency that usually happens 
throughout the full summer 
by explaining that it is in one 
of the poorest counties in the 
U.S.” Bingham said. “I agreed 
to propose a project through 
the STUDIO for Creative Inqui­
ry in Carnegie Mellon’s College 
pf Fine Arts and to spread out a
food-growing and -distribution 
project over two years to allow 
for research, site visits, com­
munity process, growing, and 
harvesting.”
The project quickly expand­
ed with Bingham’s inclusion 
•of Carnegie Mellon alumni 
Hewelett and Reves. “I could 
not imagine doing it alone, so 
I found two former students 
who create art about food to 
collaborate with,” Bingham 
said.
Bingham, Hewlett, and 
Reeves spent a week in York in 
March 2008 with the hopes of 
gaining an understanding of 
the layout of the town’s land. 
During this visit, they met Cath­
erine Shelton, a self-taught or­
ganic gardener. Working with 
her, the artists established the 
first large community garden

Lave gets environmental award Hendrickson tracks water use
On June 24, Carnegie 
Mellon’s Lester B. Lave will 
receive the prestigious 2010 
Richard Beatty Mellon En­
vironmental Stewardship 
Award, given by the Air and 
Waste Management Associa­
tion. Lave is the Harry B. and 
James H. Higgins professor 
of economics. He also acts as 
the director of Carnegie Mel­
lon’s Green Design Initiative 
and is the co*director of the 
university’s Electricity Indus­
try Center.
The Richard Beatty Mellon 
Environmental Stewardship 
Award is annually awarded to 
an individual whose actions 
have greatly encouraged the 
betterment of the environ­
ment, especially in the con­
trol of air pollution and waste 
management. Lave will ac­
cept the award at the Air and 
Waste Management Associa­
tion’s annual meeting, held 
this year in Calgary, Canada.
Lave has accomplished 
much during his time at 
Carnegie Mellon, advancing 
the effort to encourage envi­
ronmental responsibility. In 
1970, Lave, with his Ph.D. 
student Eugene Seskin, pub­
lished a research paper in the 
journal Science titled “Air Pol­
lution and Human Health.” 
This paper linked high lev­
els of air pollution with the 
shortening life spans of peo­
ple in American cities — a 
concept which, while anger­
ing industries, would even­
tually revolutionize the envi­
ronmental responsibilities of 
corporations. In 1982, Lave 
was elected to the National 
Academies Institute of Medi­
cine for his contributions in 
air quality and health.
Lave earned a bachelor’s 
degree in economics from 
Reed College in 1960 and a 
Ph.D. in economics from Har­
vard University in 1963.
Chris Hendrickson, a Car­
negie Mellon professor of 
civil and environmental en­
gineering, is leading a team 
of researchers who are study­
ing the amount of water used 
in the production of various 
goods such as pet food and 
sugar.
The goal of the group’s 
study is to help industries 
track and make better man­
agement decisions about how 
they use water during the cre­
ation of their products.
Hendrickson, along with 
civil engineering Ph.D. candi­
dates Michael Blackhurst and 
Jordi Vidal, has committed 
to studying industrial water 
usage with the hopes of dis­
covering the indirect usages 
of water that are not often 
reported.
Hendrickson’s team found 
that most companies’ con­
sumption of water is hidden 
because water usage is not
measured when used in in­
direct processes like produc­
tion.
In 96 percent of sectors 
evaluated, indirect uses ex­
ceeded direct uses through­
out the supply chain.
Through the study, the 
researchers discovered that 
it takes almost 270 gallons 
of water to produce $1 worth 
of sugar, 140 gallons to make 
$1 worth of milk, and 200 
gallons of water to make $1 
worth of cat and dog food.
The team hopes that their 
results will encourage effec­
tive and appropriate water 
usage in industry.

derson and his team’s research

Professor loses Jeopardy by $1
JEOPARDY, from'A1
continued into Final Jeop­
ardy, when, before the last 
question, Garcia had $11,600 
to Galoozis’ $14,000.
In deciding what to make 
as his final wager, Garcia de­
cided to base it on the catego­
ry. “If I see British monarchs, 
I’ll play more defensively. If I 
see architecture, I’ll play more 
offensively,” he said.
The Final Jeopardy cat­
egory was “Artists” and the 
question: “In 1882, this artist 
wrote that ‘Though I am often 
in the depths of misery, there 
is still calmness, pure har­
mony, and music inside me.’” 
Garcia’s reasoning relied on 
the clue “misery,” which led 
him to the answer of Vincent 
Van Gogh. Though he got the 
answer correct, his opponent 
bet just enough to take the fi­
nal lead.
By how much? One dollar.
Garcia described the out­
come as one based on a game 
that “is so random” and “luck- 
filled.”
Apart from the game play, 
Garcia was surprised to see 
two sides to the game’s host, 
Alex Trebek. According to 
Garcia, while the cameras 
are rolling, Trebek maintains 
a serious exterior; however, 
there’s also a light-hearted 
man beneath. “Trebek does 
a great job of entertaining,”
Garcia said.
Those who watch Jeopar­
dy may wonder what Trebek 
talks about during the show’s 
end credits.
Garcia, with a straight face, 
explained that Trebek talked 
with a contestant about fer­
rets, as well as began a discus­
sion of the possibility of own­
ing a wolverine.
Cassie Osterman, a first- 
year architecture major, got 
together with many fellow 
architecture majors to watch 
Garcia, who she described as
“riveting,” on the air.
Stephen Lee, professor and 
head of the School of Archi­
tecture, was excited to hear 
that students joined together 
to watch their professor, say­
ing that “getting together in a 
social setting is important to 
our mental health and fun.” 
Regarding Garcia’s participa­
tion in the non-design event, 
Lee said: “My agenda is to 
promote and encourage in­
terdisciplinary education and 
research ... so [Garcia’s par­
ticipation] was perfect.”
Skloot’s book discusses research, ethics issues

Garcia’s stint on Jeopardy realized his decade-old dream and brought 
architecture majors together as they watched their professor perform.

as a control for ‘normal be­
havior,”’ said Braun follow­
ing the event, “we tested 
them against other cancerous 
tissues.”
Even the author had con­
ducted research using HeLa 
cells as an undergraduate 
biology major. “I was excited 
every time I looked through 
the microscope because there 
she was,” Skloot said.
4 Skloot began her aca­
demic career in biology and 
in her junior year gravitated 
towards creative writing. 
“At the college I attended, 
creative writing counted as 
a foreign language so I took 
that instead of Spanish,” said 
a chuckling Skloot. The au­
thor worked on The Immortal 
Life of Henrietta Lacks for 10 
years, leaving her master’s 
work to pursue the book. She 
later returned to the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh with a copy 
of the rough draft. There, she 
received her MFA in creative 
non-fiction.
The author spoke to a 200- 
plus audience in East Balti­
more the week before coming 
to Carnegie Mellon. “They 
were pissed,” said Skloot, 
“not at me though.” “Black 
residents near Hopkins have 
long believed the hospital
was built in a poor black 
neighborhood for the benefit 
of scientists — to give them 
easy access to potential re­
search subjects,” reads Chap­
ter 21. “As soon as they know 
the family is onboard though, 
there’s not a resistance [to 
writing about Lacks],” said 
the author.
“I think it’s always impor­
tant to remember the ‘life’ in 
life sciences,” said associate 
professor Jay Aronson of the 
ethics, history, and public 
policy program. “It’s one of 
those books that opens your 
eyes to the hidden human di­
mension of biomedicine, tis­
sues, and common economic 
stratification. It takes the lens 
off America and American 
medicine.”
Students and faculty stood 
in line for words with the au­
thor following the event.
“I was really moved. It’s 
embarrassing because I never 
really thought about where 
tissues for research come 
from,” said Kelsey Briggs, a 
materials science and bio­
medical engineering sopho­
more. “I’m interested in 
learning more about ethics 
because it addresses all sides 
of human life.”
The Immortal Life of Hen­
rietta Lacks is available at the 
Carnegie Mellon Bookstore.
Carnegie Mellon professor creates One Mile Garden
GARDEN, from A1
at the Coleman Center. As the 
project grew, satellite gardens 
were then established at sites 
throughout York.
“On Oct. 31,2009 we plant­
ed a 54-fruit-tree orchard in 
Cherokee Park with the Fruit 
Tree Planting Foundation from 
California, with the help of 40 
volunteers from the Truevine 
Fellowship Church across the
street,” Bingham said. In ad­
dition to the Cherokee Park 
Orchard, other sites include 
the town’s Eastern Star Baptist 
Church and West End Junior 
High School.
One Mile Garden was fea­
tured in an exhibition at the 
Coleman Center gallery from 
Sept. 25 to Nov. 13, 2009.
Clara Baron-Hyppolite, a 
sophomore decision science 
and psychology double ma­
jor, said, “I just think it’s really 
inspirational that a member 
of our faculty would take the 
Carnegie Mellon value of com­
bining the arts and practicality 
to develop the greater good of 
the community.”
Norlex Belma, a junior 
musical performance major, 
echoed Baron-Hyppolite’s ap­
proval: “I think it’s great that 
this is happening. There are 
many people in our own coun­
try that lack the basics needed 
to survive. As students at a ma­
jor university, it is our duty to 
use what we know to benefit 
the greater community.”
One Mile Garden is signifi­
cant to Bingham as well, rep­
resenting many of the values 
that repeat throughout his 
work. “We succeeded as artists 
to establish a program for peo­
ple to engage in growing their 
own healthy food in one of the
poorest counties in the USA. 
[This process] will now con­
tinue on and serve as a model 
for other communities.” 
Bingham says he will visit 
once a quarter to check in on 
the gardens. He hopes to con­
tinue developing the project, 
establishing an artful way to 
assist people in growing larger 
amounts of food and combin­
ing a process of distributing it 
within the community.

something I thought of all 
the time. On the first day, I 
was pretty busy, hadn’t read 
the rules yet ... so I wasn’t 
really motivated to play,” 
she explained. “However, 
when I accidentally let a 
friend [Sparks] in my build­
ing so that he could kill his 
target, I realized that he 
was, in fact, my target. I just 
learned his last name as he 
walked into the building.”
Sparks stunned Hulse 
before she could assassinate 
him, but Hulse was quickly 
motivated to try again. “I 
was ready to follow up and 
get my first kill,” Hulse said.
“On Sunday night, three 
of my ‘associates’ and I 
were in my dorm and one 
of my classmates came in, 
saying that my next target 
was back on campus,” said 
Sparks. “When we went 
out into the Hamerschlag 
lounge, my frontman didn’t 
see my assassin [Hulse] hid­
ing behind the vending ma­
chines waiting for me.”
“One thing led to an­
other, and on the night I 
planned to kill my one target 
[Sparks], I ended up killing 
two successive targets as 
well, getting three kills in 
one night,” Hulse said.
Currently, Hulse is still 
“alive” and has accumu­
lated five kills so far. “Now 
that I’m a key player in the 
game, I am more motivated 
to stay in it. We’ll see what 
happens,” Hulse said.
With a little more than a 
quarter of the original par­
ticipants remaining by the 
end of the first week, Sa- 
deghi wonders if the game 
will last the duration of the 
semester. “Maybe the last 
people alive will play very 
carefully, which might ex­
tend the game for a while.”

Robotic instruments make music

Eric Singer poses with one of his robotic instruments, XyloBot, which 
uses an array of mallets to play a xylophone much like a real musician 
would.
HOW THINGS WORKCloud computing: Offering online services
PHILIP ORBETA
Junior Staffwriter
BRIAN LEE
SciTech Editor
Many regard music as the 
universal language. But get­
ting robots to speak any lan­
guage is harder than it seems.
Eric Singer is a musician 
who also holds an electrical 
and computer engineering 
degree from Carnegie Mel­
lon. However, his passion for 
music was too great to ignore, 
and he studied music synthe­
sis in the Berklee College of 
Music after graduating.
“I’ve been a sax player since 
grade school and have been 
interested and involved in 
technology for about as long,” 
Singer said. With this mind­
set, he created innovative 
musical robots, using them to 
play along with some of the 
most famous musicians.
Singer founded LEMUR, 
or the League of Electronic 
Musical Urban Robots, in 
2000 as a means of combin­
ing musical instruments and 
robotics. The group, accord­
ing to Singer, has “had about 
100 members in the form of 
contributing artists, technolo­
gists, and apprentices.” It has 
already created a variety of 
robotic instruments. Some of 
the most memorable include 
GuitarBot, a four-stringed ro­
bot that plucks strings — the 
pitch can be altered by mov­
ing sliders up and down the 
strings. Singer described his 
update to GuitarBot: “I’ve just 
spent the last year creating 
GuitarBot Mark II, an updat­
ed, sexier, and more reliable
version of the original.” In 
addition, some robots can be 
manipulated by humans. “My 
favorites have been the Slime- 
o-trons, which use conductive 
‘slime’ to control musical algo­
rithms, and the Slink-o-trons, 
which convert the motion of 
Slinkys into musical controls,” 
Singer said. Many of his in­
struments have intrigued mu­
sicians looking for something 
new, including world-famous
guitarist Pat Metheny, who 
recorded with a set of robotic 
instruments on his album Or­
chestrion, according to the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Besides musical instru­
ments, Singer also programs 
performance systems that in­
teract with live performances.

At the rate at which tech­
nology is being developed, it 
is easy to get lost in a bom­
bardment of tech words and 
fancy lingo referring to new 
pieces of hardware and soft­
ware. One of these words that 
has gained more attention in 
recent times is the term “cloud 
computing.” Upon hearing 
the term, it is probably not en­
tirely clear what it is or how it 
works, but for those who have 
used some form of cloud com­
puting service themselves, it 
is evident why it has become 
a buzzword used even at the 
top levels of the software and 
information technology in­
dustries.
Cloud computing may be 
simpler than it seems. Think 
of a network of computers 
that are either linked for the 
use of a company or people 
simply working on a similar
project. In order to make sure 
that progress occurs as ef­
ficiently as- possible, it is im­
portant that each person is 
equipped with the right hard­
ware and software to do his 
or her job. Additionally, when 
dealing with a project that 
may eventually expand, it is 
also important to consider the 
costs of paying for licensing of 
additional members, costs of 
additional data storage, and 
even upgrades in software 
versions. This would normal­
ly be frustrating for any group 
using conventional file shar­
ing or file transfer methods. 
With cloud computing, how­
ever, many of these problems 
are easily resolved.
By abstracting key aspects 
of a project, such as memory 
storage and file sharing, and 
providing them as a service 
on the Internet, the project 
becomes more scalable and 
dynamic, while maintain­
ing structure and simplic-
ity in use, according to www. 
cloudcomputing.sys-con. 
com.
Among people who are 
more familiar with comput­
ing and its terminology, cloud 
computing has often been 
compared to grid computing, 
utility computing, and auto­
nomic computing. Grid com­
puting commonly refers to a 
cluster of networked, loosely 
coupled computers that form 
a virtual supercomputer, used 
in order to perform very large 
tasks. Utility computing re­
fers to computing resources 
that are charged based on 
the amount of use, similar to 
utilities such as electricity and 
water. Autonomic comput­
ing refers to computer sys­
tems that are capable of self­
management. In many ways, 
certain cloud computing 
services share common traits 
with each of these concepts.

Cloud computing simplifies computing projects by having certain services provided on the Internet. Data can 
be stored over the Internet in servers like these.
Human écholocation: Navigating by hearing rather than seeing
AMANDA COLE
Contributing Editor
In the wild, when animals 
have poor vision, they must 
use their other senses to make 
their way around. For decades, 
studies have suggested that 
humans too may be able to 
navigate without using their 
eyes, but until now this possi­
bility was not confirmed.
A 2009 study from the Uni­
versity of Alcalá de Henares 
(UAH) in Spain has proven
that humans are capable of 
écholocation, which is used 
by animals like dolphins and 
bats. While this ability is not 
one most humans would claim 
to use, it is a skill that can be 
developed. It will be especially 
useful, scientists believe, for 
the blind and for rescue work­
ers.
Echolocation relies upon 
sound in order to navigate and 
explore. Animals use écholo­
cation to determine the prox­
imity of an object or objects
Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons
Echolocation is commonly associated with bats and dolphins. The main 
principle behind animal écholocation involves listening for the echo of 
sounds an animal makes to judge the size and location of objects.
by making clicking sounds 
and listening for the echo of 
that sound. By observing the 
amount of time that elapses 
between the click and its echo, 
animals can determine how 
close or how far away the ob­
ject is. This works in a way 
similar to vision. Both seeing 
and hearing rely upon the re­
flection of waves (light waves 
for seeing and. sound waves 
for hearing), and by learning 
to interpret reflected sound 
waves, humans can explore 
the world through sound rath­
er than through sight.
According to this study, hu­
mans are capable of learning 
to listen and interpret sounds 
to navigate the world without 
using sight. Unlike in the ani­
mal world, however, this abili­
ty is not something that comes 
naturally.
In order to use écholoca­
tion, humans would need to 
participate in a training pro­
cess to learn how to properly 
interpret the information they 
receive. First, a person must 
learn how to make the proper 
sounds. According to a June 
2009 ScienceDaily.com ar­
ticle, Juan Antonio Martinez,
the lead author of the study, 
believes that “palate clicks” 
are the best sound to use for 
écholocation. Palate clicks are 
made by placing the tongue on 
the palate, directly behind the 
teeth, and moving it rapidly 
backwards.
Once the sound is mas­
tered, learning to use écholo­
cation requires a great deal of 
practice. Echolocation trainees 
should practice using clicks to 
determine whether there are 
objects in front of them, be­
ginning with small objects and 
moving on to larger ones. With 
enough practice, écholocation 
can be used to determine not 
only how far an object is, but 
potentially what kind or size of 
object is present.
While the possibility of 
humans using , écholocation 
was only recently confirmed, 
people have been training 
themselves to use sounds to 
judge distances and help with 
navigation for quite some 
time. One of the most famous 
self-taught écholocation us­
ers was Ben Underwood. He 
had his eyes removed because 
of retinal cancer at the age of 
two and began to use écholo­
cation to get around at the age
of five.
Underwood died of can­
cer in 2009 at age 16, but in 
the years before his death, 
he managed to become pro­
ficient in the use of écholoca­
tion. YouTube videos and a 
documentary show Under­
wood riding a bicycle, playing 
basketball, and even playing 
video games, all without the 
use of sight. Underwood’s abil­
ity to use only écholocation to 
determine what was around 
him was unique, as he used no 
other aids to help him around. 
Instead, he chose to fine-tune 
his ability to judge his sur­
roundings via sound.
Another well known hu­
man écholocation user is Dan­
iel Kish, who also lost his vi­
sion due to retinal cancer as a 
child. Kish taught himself how ' 
to use écholocation, determin­
ing what kinds of objects were 
around him, as well as how 
far away they were. Now, Kish 
works to help other blind peo­
ple learn to use écholocation 
to increase their mobility.
While human écholocation 
has reportedly been used since 
the 18th century to help blind
humans get around, it was 
not confirmed or understood 
until recently that all humans 
are capable of écholocation 
with the proper training and 
practice. Scientists believe 
that while this skill is very use­
ful for the blind, it is also po­
tentially beneficial for rescue 
workers, like firefighters, who 
need to navigate in situations 
where it is impossible to see 
clearly, such as smoky rooms.

Ben Underwood, who was blind, 
was able to use écholocation to 
do the same things his sighted 
friends could do.
SC1IECH BRIEFS
Less massive dark matter discoveredTigerText creator makes texting private China and Google have a standoff
In the Soudan mine of Minnesota, two experiments — the 
Cyrogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMSII) and the Coherent Ger­
manium Neutrino Technology (CoGeNT) — have yielded results 
that may lead to new information about the size and sensitivity 
of dark matter, which is thought to be the most abundant form 
of matter in the universe.
Two weeks ago, CDMSII discovered particles resembling dark 
matter in the mine. The underground mine is known for its lack 
of particle activity, meaning there are few subatomic particles in 
the atmosphere that one would find in abundance at the earth’s 
surface. CoGeNT reported they observed similar dark matter 
particles with a smaller mass. Confirmation of the CoGeNT re­
sults would, according to physicist Juan Collar, “shift attention 
to experiments that are sensitive to lower energies,” since detec­
tion of the particles occurred at the lower energy sensitivities of 
the detectors.
Skepticism concerning results has been strong. The less mas­
sive CoGeNT particles do not match up with dark matter being 
investigated by space satellites. The CoGeNT experiment itself 
may also be faulty, since it is less shielded and more susceptible 
to unrelated radio waves than the CDMSII.
Following the revelation of golfer Tiger Wood’s numerous af­
fairs and his subsequent apology last week, former recruiter and 
headhunter Jeffrey Evans responded by creating the TigerText 
iPhone app, launched on Feb. 25.
With the app, users who may not want their received text 
messages to be disclosed to others-can store them in the Tiger­
Text server and set a certain time limit for the message lifespan. 
After the time limit has expired, the message disappears from 
both phones and the server. Recipients can see the texts, but they 
cannot respond. Any incriminating messages, therefore, can be 
deleted from existence.
Evans denies any claim that the phone was designed for 
cheating spouses, or that it was named after Tiger Woods in the 
first place. He designed it primarily to allow iPhone users to have 
more control over their privacy.
Pointing to a ruling by the European Union in 2006 that 
phone and Internet providers would hold onto texts for a certain 
period of time, he claimed that the app was directed toward law­
yers and business executives.
Whether this app was a practical investment or, as Time puts 
it, simply “stupidity insurance” remains to be seen.
China has threatened to shut down Google’s operations in­
side China due to Google’s decision to reduce censorship on its 
Chinese website. The situation began when, in late 2009, a series 
of Internet attacks against several U.S. corporations, including 
Google, was found to originate in China. The attacks targeted 
not only the companies, but also the e-mail accounts of several 
Chinese human-rights activists.
In response, Google declared that it would stop restricting 
searches on its Chinese language search engine, prompting 
threats from the Chinese government.
Both powers have considerable influence. Google, accord­
ing to Rebecca MacKinnon of Princeton University’s Center for 
Information Technology Policy, has a large enough presence “to 
define the standard operating rules of the Internet.” With the 
freedom of ideas available online, Google could very well com­
bat any authoritarian regime.
China, however, has had a history of restricting Internet ac­
cess through a list of blocked IP addresses known as “The Great 
Firewall.” Although the bandwidth is reaching maximum capac­
ity in the country, China’s circumvention could find any number 
of unfavorable IP addresses.

Cloud computing changes the Web
COMPUTING, from A4
However, every service ex­
hibits different aspects based 
on its functionality, and thus 
cannot be classified into one 
category or another.
Aside from being scalable 
and dynamic, cloud comput­
ing services are often cost- 
efficient due to an individual 
service’s ability to maintain its 
technological infrastructure 
on its own, in addition to the 
utility-based pricing often im­
plemented with its use- Since 
services are accessible online, 
information resources can be 
accessed on any machine with 
Internet access. Given the 
centralized structure of these
services, security becomes 
more efficient while main­
taining reliability provided 
by redundant sites in terms 
of disaster recovery and busi­
ness continuity. Switching 
costs associated with cloud 
computing are often very low. 
A business looking to transfer 
their system “to the cloud” 
can do so with minimal bar­
riers to entry, according to 
www.howstuffworks. com.
Several cloud computing 
applications are Software as a 
Service, Platform as a Service, 
Managed Service Providers, 
Service Commerce, and Inter­
net Integration. Services in­
clude Salesforce CRM, which 
is used to automate and orga­
nize sales-related activities; 
Amazon Web Services, which 
is a group of software services 
developers can use to build 
cloud-based systems; and 
Google App Engine, which is 
a platform for hosting and de­
veloping web applications.
Cloud computing, though 
relatively new, is slowly start­
ing to have a crucial impact 
on the way we handle infor­
mation and Internet resourc­
es. It is possible that we may 
soon see cloud computing 
implemented as a standard in 
the near future. What is now 
known as just another buzz­
word could become a gateway 
to a new age of information 
technology.

One of t he goals of LEMUR

that 99 percent of the music

Schools responsible for education, not surveillance
Miscarriages should not 
be equated with murder
Last month, Blake Robbins, a 
high-school sophomore in the Lower 
Merion School District near Philadel­
phia, accused an administrator of us­
ing a webcam on a school-provided 
laptop to spy on him in his home. 
Such an act, if true, would violate 
the trust of the school’s community, 
not to mention laws concerning legal 
methods of surveillance.
We condemn this gross abuse 
of power and betrayal of trust, one 
which shows a school administra­
tion losing sight of its goal of teach­
ing students and instead focusing on 
policing them.
Educators have a responsibility to 
teach, and that includes holding stu-
With the conclusion of this year’s 
Lunar Gala came the release of 
dArte, a new online magazine. dArte 
is managed by Carnegie Mellon stu­
dents and dedicated to fashion, de­
sign, and culture.
The Tartan is excited to welcome 
a new, student publication to cam­
pus. We believe increasing the pub­
lished student voice on campus is 
always valuable. Carnegie Mellon 
prides itself on diversity, and a di­
versity of media is essential to this 
goal. dArte will fill a void in terms of 
opinion geared towards fashion and
Last month, The Daily Princeto- 
nian ran a column written by first- 
year Iulia Neagu arguing that sex 
after 'an evening of drinking doesn’t 
mean a girl was raped, provided she 
decided willingly to consume alcohol. 
The opinion piece has garnered some 
national attention and has remained 
the most-viewed Princetonian piece 
for days, accumulating over 300 
comments.
However, we aren’t going to en­
ter the debate as to whether or not 
the piece is sexist or embark upon 
an explanation to define sexual con­
sent. Instead, we are going to briefly 
reflect on the position a university 
newspaper should take in publish-
dents responsible for their academic 
actions. But this responsibility does 
not justify or excuse an invasion of 
privacy. In an age of increasing sur­
veillance, the home remains a sanc­
tuary.
Not even national security agen­
cies can spy in a home without a 
warrant. That school officials are al­
legedly abusing these powers makes 
the accusations in the Lower Merion 
case profoundly disturbing. With its 
irresponsible conduct, the school dis­
trict has betrayed the trust placed in 
it by its students and its community.
Even if Blake Robbins invented 
his accusations and the defendants 
are innocent, the case still speaks to
design at the university, and it will 
hopefully flourish in this environ­
ment. Carnegie Mellon has an out­
standing arts program, and dArte 
will be able to mobilize this base for 
both content and readers.
We are happy to see that dArte 
has been updating its blog through 
the launch process. The magazine’s 
editors and designers have done a 
good job utilizing new media to gain 
readers, something that is becom­
ing increasingly important in today’s 
publishing climate.
Moreover, The Tartan is excited
ing a knowingly controversial op-ed. 
Specifically, we believe that contro­
versy can benefit a university com­
munity by creating discussion and 
productive debate about important, 
relevant issues.
College journalism is, in many 
ways, hyper-local. The audience of 
The Tartan is almost entirely com­
posed of the Carnegie Mellon com­
munity, a group of about 15,000 peo­
ple that it aims to support and report 
to. But even in our small community 
(by publishing standards), the diver­
sity of opinions is huge.
We believe it is our responsibility 
to attempt to canvass and understand 
the needs of people across the univer-
an underlying concern of our society. 
Schools across the country are pro­
viding computers with webcams and 
remote desktop software to their stu­
dents and faculty. It is likely that this 
technology is being abused right now
— and even if it is not, the fear it in­
stills in students is harmful enough.
With the opportunity for unsuper­
vised surveillance readily available, 
we must decide as a society where 
our priorities lie. The response to this 
webcam scandal shows that Ameri­
cans still care about their privacy, 
and The Tartan agrees. Privacy is a 
fundamental right and should not be 
invaded, least of all by those we trust 
to teach future generations.
design, culture
to see the sustainable business ap­
proach dArte has adopted. By going 
online first, not only have the editors 
of dArte enabled themselves to cre­
ate a brand before going to paper, 
but they will also be able to receive 
valuable feedback to decide if print 
is the right choice for the publica­
tion.
We encourage students and the 
campus community to check out

sity, realizing that many individuals 
hold views that may not be accepted 
by the community. The difficulty 
lies in helping to present these opin­
ions in a way where they will not be 
scorned, but published thoughtfully 
as a beginning of a larger discussion.
The good that has come out of 
this is reflected in the current “Most 
Viewed” list on the PrincetoniarCs 
website. While Neagu’s piece main­
tains a solid first place, two of the 
other top five articles are well-rea- 
soned responses. The Princetonian 
has created an environment for pub­
lic debate, an elusive thing that is 
often difficult to cultivate, even on a 
college campus.
A bill that passed Utah’s state 
legislature on Thursday, Feb. 18 
would charge a woman with mur­
der following a miscarriage. As the 
bill waits to be finally approved by 
the governor, there are several im­
portant arguments that must be ac­
knowledged so that this legislative 
motion never becomes a reality.
There is an outstanding question 
of agency here that is being ignored 
by the most poignant language of 
the bill: that women would be pun­
ished with up to a life sentence in 
prison for murder following an “in­
tentional, knowing, or reckless act” 
without a doctor’s supervision that 
would lead to the termination of a 
pregnancy.
Regardless of how responsible a 
woman is, a murder charge is hardly 
the answer.
Yes — if you consider an un­
born child to be the same as a liv­
ing, breathing human being, then 
you might equate actively causing 
the death of the unborn child to ac­
tively causing the death of any other 
person. But this is not an argument 
about when life begins. This is a 
question of agency, and even more 
an issue of privacy.
Somehow, the issue of an indi­
vidual woman’s health has been 
broadcast on the public political 
stage.
Unless a person has a uterus and 
has been faced with either an un­
planned, ill-timed, or failed preg­
nancy, it is impossible to judge what 
a person finding themselves in any 
of those three situations should or 
can do.
Even the term “reckless’' is ques­
tionable. It is not the same as inten­
tional. It is only the same in that the 
pregnant woman in question might 
not have intentionally or actively 
been protecting her unborn child
— not that this is right, but it does 
not merit life in prison.
Supporters of the bill argue that 
it will only target women who pur­
sue illegal means of terminating 
their pregnancies. Abstaining from 
an argument of whether or not even 
that would be right, I have to ques­
tion: If that were true, then why can
* the bill lead to the prosecution of 
women who miscarry following a 
car accident or a beating by an abu­
sive partner?
The sentiments supporting this 
bill are, then, “part of the cycle of 
domestic violence,” said Senator 
Luz Robles, a Democrat from Salt 
Lake City.
It is true that some women might 
actively seek a miscarriage rather 
than consult a doctor for a planned 
abortion. Some women might not 
always go about every situation in 
the most responsible or safest way, 
especially with an issue as multi-di­
mensional as a pregnancy, and espe­
cially with an unplanned one. But as 
long as a culture pervades in which 
no one can talk about unplanned 
pregnancies, and in which no one 
can easily come out and admit to 
an abortion, it is possible that some 
women might induce a miscarriage 
of their own means.
I challenge anybody that is anti­
choice to find a significant popula­
tion of women that have pursued a 
miscarriage and were at any point 
satisfied by doing so. Without an 
open dialogue, these women are 
alone. They are not malicious; they 
are simply trapped in incredibly dif­
ficult circumstances.
Miscarriages are not something 
women should ever have to de­
fend themselves for. They’re going 
through enough — and being put 
on trial for a terminated pregnancy 
is barbaric.
A woman dealing with a miscar­
riage is experiencing enough emo­
tional and physical pain without 
dealing with a restrictive and ill-in- 
formed legislative body threatening 
to punish her even more.
This pain is not to be disregarded, 
and should not be reduced to simple 
hormonal reactions or dramatic 
emotional responses. Her feelings 
are real. Regardless of a woman’s 
agency — or lack thereof — in caus­
ing her miscarriage, the scar is last­
ing. Squandering the rights and 
feelings of women who are trapped 
in such painful situations by ar­
resting them would most certainly 
be an irresponsible and backward 
measure.
What the Utah legislature must 
take away from the rightful back­
lash against this proposed law is 
the indisputable fact that any preg­
nancy — especially one that ends in 
an abortion or a miscarriage — is 
incredibly complicated. It is neyer a 
black-and-white issue, and actions 
leading up to the termination of a 
pregnancy cannot be easily catego­
rized into actions that should land 
a woman in jail. As much as Utah’s 
government wants to see pregnancy 
as a process with a clear, recogniz­
able, and consistent set of steps, this 
is simply not reality.
Many advocates of women’s 
health rights argue that this law 
would be even less about protect­
ing those who cannot speak for 
themselves and more about simply 
punishing women — and I have to 
agree.
Until legislation is passed and a 
general social sentiment is accepted 
that is primarily shaped by the opin­
ions of women who have faced un­
planned pregnancies, abortions, or 
miscarriages, any negative legisla­
tion is and will be indisputably in­
humane and malicious.
Women who have faced, are fac­
ing, or will face an unplanned preg­
nancy, a miscarriage, or an abor­
tion, are regular people.
They have voices, and they 
have the right to have their opin­
ions heard. Unless their opinions 
are going to be respected and fully 
represented in the public sector, 
legislation ignoring them cannot be 
justified.
Right now, too many women feel 
shameful following their experience 
of any of the above life-changing 
events — chosen or not — and are 
silenced, if not by an abusive part­
ner or a horrendously anti-choice 
state government, then by the un­
spoken pulses of a society in which 
issues of morality and mortality are 
still far too complicated by an overly 
conservative culture.
I want those women to be able 
to speak out. I want them to be 
free to discuss what they have been 
through. Never should a woman sit 
in prison, punished by other human 
beings for something that only she 
can understand.
Actively chosen or not, miscar­
riages are a personal matter, and 
the Utah legislative body is acting 
inhumanely by making them — and 
the women that have gone through 
them — a public spectacle.

State System’s strategy of eliminating majors 
reduces overall quality of public education
Ciu
In high school, when trying to de­
cide which college to attend, I looked 
at a lot of information about each 
school I was applying to — the size 
of the classes, the student-to-faculty 
ratio, the area around the school, 
and the majors that the school of­
fered. For me, a school needed to of­
fer a wide variety of majors because I 
wasn’t altogether sure what I wanted 
to study, and I wanted to keep my op­
tions open.
Colleges and universities that of­
fer a diverse array of majors usually 
seem more appealing to students, 
regardless of how large or small each 
department might be. The state of 
Pennsylvania, though, seems to think 
that only some majors are worth 
having.
A recent Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
article states that the Pennsylvania 
State System of Higher Education is 
considering eliminating many majors 
at state-owned universities such as 
Indiana University of Pennsylvania 
and Lock Haven University. Majors 
with fewer than 30 graduates over 
five years will be reviewed.
This means that over 200 majors 
are currently being examined for po­
tential elimination. The majors be­
ing examined at each of the state’s 
14 universities vary, but they include 
majors in departments like chemis­
try, French, math, German, econom­
ics, philosophy, and mass communi­
cations, just to name a few.
This change is being proposed in 
order to save money and cut costs in 
anticipation of reduced federal and 
state funding for the universities. 
Cutting costs may be necessary, but 
cutting majors is not.
For students who can only af­
ford to attend state-owned schools, 
this decision will likely provide huge 
disadvantages. Students may be 
forced to study things that don’t in­
terest them; they might be forced to 
attend a school with fewer advan-
FROM ALL AROUND KiCm-Q
tages for them, or one that isn’t such 
a good fit.
Universities are centers for educa­
tion. Students should graduate hav­
ing had a well-rounded education 
with courses in both the sciences and 
the humanities. This will provide a 
better perspective for them — but 
only if the courses they take are of 
high quality.
If universities are forced to elimi­
nate certain majors, faculty members 
from those departments are likely 
to leave the university. Students 
will be left without qualified teach­
ers or will be unable to take classes 
in certain fields, possibly blocking 
them from finding out what really 
interests them.
In addition, public universities 
will lose their competitive advantage 
over private ones. While state-owned 
schools are less expensive than pri­
vate schools, part of their appeal de­
pends upon the diversity they offer, 
and not just in terms of students.
By taking classes in areas that may 
be less popular, students broaden 
their horizons and gain the oppor­
tunity to share views with more di­
verse groups of people. A diversity of 
classes and ideas is just as important 
as a diversity of students, and cutting 
majors that don’t have huge numbers 
of people in them jeopardizes this di­
versity.
In the Post-Gazette article, Kenn 
Marshall, the State System spokes­
man, said that they were trying to 
help, students where they needed 
help most, meaning financially. By 
cutting majors, the universities could 
avoid raising tuition.
Marshall assumes incorrectly that 
the state’s priority should be to help 
students financially at the expense 
of their educational opportunities. 
While it is important to keep costs for 
students as low as possible, sacrific­
ing the quality of the students’ educa­
tion is not the best way to do this.
Moreover, the state should not be 
making decisions that are better left 
to university officials. The state is re­
sponsible for the financial aspects of 
these universities, but the education­
al side of the university — including 
decisions about which majors to offer 
to draw more students to the institu­
tion — should be made by school ad­
ministrators.
With the elimination of so many 
majors across the board at Pennsylva­
nia-owned universities, it will become 
more difficult to attract students from 
out of state or from other countries, 
decreasing diversity at the schools.
Putting finances ahead of educa­
tional quality and diversity may also 
affect universities’ rankings, which 
are often important for students and 
employers, not to mention the uni­
versities themselves.
Students who would have other­
wise chosen to attend a university in 
Pennsylvania might decide to attend 
a school in another state or a private 
institution, decreasing the amount 
of money schools get from tuition 
and fees.
While there may be fewer students 
to educate, many of the costs at uni­
versities are fixed. For example, the
salaries of professors and staff mem­
bers are unlikely to decrease with a 
decrease in the number of students, 
and campus maintenance costs will 
remain roughly the same as well. This 
puts the universities in an even worse 
position financially.
Even putting this aside, though, it 
is unclear why the state is willing to 
make sacrifices in higher education 
even as the federal government is try­
ing to improve primary and second­
ary education to better prepare stu­
dents for college.
The federal government has made 
education a priority, and the state of 
Pennsylvania should, too. The State 
System of Higher Education should 
look elsewhere for places to cut bud­
gets without sacrificing the quality 
and diversity of education in state- 
owned universities.
Amanda Cole (aco\e@) is a senior 
English major and isn’t sure whether 
her major would survive the State 
System’s cuts.

Job searching in Qatar challenged by discrimination
MARYAM YOUSUF
Special to The Tartan
Despite the revolutionary devel­
opment in Qatar and the diversity of 
nationalities there, the fact that there 
is a bias toward a certain nationality 
or stereotype cannot be overlooked, 
especially when this bias conflicts 
with job and internship opportuni­
ties.
Summer break is near, and appli­
cations for internships are flooding 
into huge companies all around the 
state of Qatar, such as Qatar Petro­
leum, RasGas, and many more. It 
is hard not to question how equally 
each application will be treated and 
how many exceptions and overlooks 
will be taken on certain applicants.
It is natural to be attracted toward 
people with the same nationality, re­
ligion, or a certain social stereotype. 
This bias is ruining the reputation of 
many well-known companies, which 
reflects their unacceptable level of
unprofessionalism. This issue should 
be a matter of concern to both stu­
dents (of all nationalities) and com­
panies who are missing out on a lot of 
neglected, skillful candidates.
Where does this bias in attitude 
come from? Sine« the majority of 
people in Qatar are expatriates and 
residents of the country, a policy was 
put forward to assure future jobs for 
Qatari youth: “Qatarization.” It is a 
concept, very well known nowadays, 
that builds up both a threat and an 
opportunity for people of different 
nationalities in Qatar. The certain 
number of job opportunities in each 
firm or company reserved for Qa­
taris encourages the companies to 
lay out a corresponding number of 
internship opportunities as well. The 
strategy was feared for the reactions 
of residents in Qatar and underedu­
cated Qataris as well, but explains 
an idea toward a better future within 
the hands of the nation itself.
Questions here are raised: Is this
concept of tending to a specific na­
tionality actually a “bias in disguise” 
under the name of a new future 
policy? Or is it a plan to assure a fu­
ture for Qataris who were threatened 
by being the minority in their own 
country?
The official Qatarization website 
states in its mission statement: “The 
development of the Qatari work­
force, through proper education and 
training, is now a primary national 
objective designed to enhance the 
development of the country.”
The workplace, the educational 
institute, or any other institution 
must give both the Qatari and inter­
national student the same opportu­
nity and experience. But the fact that 
social factors are put into the equa­
tion of success in the fields of work or 
study is destined and inevitable. It is 
no myth that people take advantage 
and “use” their names, their titles, 
or their nationalities to bring them­
selves forward to win an exception
or simply to be noticed. To what ex­
tent should this subjective attitude be 
considered unjust or offensive? Isn’t 
equality what we look for in a devel­
oped country such as Qatar? Or is the 
country simply assuring the future of 
its nation?
The injustice is debatable when it 
comes to non-Qataris who are work­
ing or students who have the intern­
ship slot in hand, but it has never 
been or will be that Qatar would 
“kick out” someone off their status to 
give it to another with a more appeal­
ing nationality. It is only a matter of 
concern toward those qualifications 
that might be misplaced or offended. 
Of course, it is also unquestionable 
that Qatar’s market will always need 
professionals from other nationalities 
to fill the fields of work that Qatar’s 
work force is lacking. Yet, students 
who are on the hunt for internship 
opportunities will find it difficult to 
do so if they have a subjective atti­
tude at every path they turn to.
LEADERSHIP PERSPECTIVES..-.Students 
serve world 
over break
COURTNEY SUTTER
I just wanted to go to South 
America. Pure, childlike, wide- 
eyed wonderment: That’s how I 
got roped into this.
As a sophomore, I was just 
emerging from the titanium shell I 
had been constructing since birth 
and was beginning to develop and 
discover my passions. I heard a ru­
mor about a group called Alterna­
tive Break going on a service trip to 
South America, and I wanted in.
After showing up late to the info 
session in Doherty Hall on a rainy 
autumn afternoon (I fell asleep), 
I caught the end of a Q & A and 
learned that the group was going 
to work on a bio-marine reserve in 
Ecuador over spring break. Wow
— would there be sloths, I won­
dered. Would we take pond scum 
samples?
Regardless, this sounded just 
up my alley — helping the world in 
a part of it I’d never seen.
When the meeting ended, I ap­
proached one of the leaders, try­
ing to suppress my excitement. 
The only thing I could think to say 
was, “Uh, sorry I was late.” I don’t 
remember who I was talking to, 
but he smiled warmly and said, 
“Here’s the sign-in sheet! Did you 
get an application?”
I applied, was selected, 
squealed excitedly, hoped there 
would be sloths, and then told my 
mother I wouldn’t be home for 
spring break.
Today, after returning from Ec­
uador and leading a trip to Peru, 
I’m co-president of this organiza­
tion — an organization that strives 
to provide students at Carnegie 
Mellon with the opportunity to 
serve the world community over 
break.
Since Alternative Break first 
appeared at Carnegie Mellon in 
2005, students have spent their 
breaks scattered across the West­
ern Hemisphere. This year, 15 
students will be spending spring 
break at an orphanage in the Do­
minican Republic.
The service we do is by no 
means as simple as gathering a 
group of friends, booking plane 
tickets, and jetting away. The plan­
ning for these trips usually begins 
in August, though some have been 
planned as early as 11 months 
before. Even with all that time, 
we still manage to run into snags 
along the way.
As a leader of the organization, 
I’ve learned volumes about myself 
(good, bad, and neutral) since that 
rainy day. One thing I’ve gleaned 
from the experience is that evo­
lution is essential — we’re still a 
fairly young organization, growing 
out of our shoes and trying to find 
the perfect fit. But isn’t a perfect fit 
what we’re all striving for in life?

native Break, visit www.andrew.

Sophomore Paul Haberman competes in the Conference Finals slalom 
race at Tussey Ski Area near State College, Pa.
ALPINE, from A10
race involving quick turning 
and precision, whereas GS 
features wider radius turns 
at higher speeds.
During conference com­
petition in the ACSC, Car­
negie Mellon recorded its 
best ski season to date with 
third-place finishes from 
both the women’s and men’s 
team. The ACSC’s top teams 
include Penn State, Buck- 
nell, Villanova, and the Na­
val Academy. The women’s 
team’s high point of the sea­
son came during the fourth 
weekend of competition, 
when the team placed sec­
ond.
The team was also well 
represented on the individ­
ual level. Sophomore Nicola 
Carey, a civil engineering 
major, placed ninth in the 
season out of 70 women in 
the conference. Carey fin­
ished every race during the 
season, and had a season- 
best finish of eighth dur­
ing the first race at Wisp in 
Maryland.
Junior Ben Streeter, a me­
chanical engineering major,
finished ninth out of 70 men 
in the conference. Streeter’s 
best finish of the season, 
sixth, came at Elk Moun­
tain’s GS race. Rounding 
out the Tartans was junior 
Jeff Bizzak, also a mechani­
cal engineering major, who 
finished the season in 11th 
place and landed in the top 
10 in three different rates. 
These individual results are 
a great accomplishment: 
Historically, no Tartan racer 
had ever finished a season in 
the top 10.
Streeter shared his 
thoughts about Carnegie 
Mellon’s best season yet. “I 
am thankful that our team 
was able to put together a 
great season start to finish. 
This was due to many contri­
butions from every individ­
ual on the team. The team’s 
enthusiasm about skiing, in 
addition to the thrill of com­
petition and the challenge 
of skiing, makes ski racing a 
great sport,” he said.
Although the race season 
is now over for the Tartans, 
the team looks forward to 
another season of competi­
tion beginning next January.

Tartans were defeated in their last game of the season.

those points en route to an 
eight-point first half.
Shortly thereafter, the 
Spartans took off with the 
scoring with a 23-8 run that 
buried the Tartans in a 52-34 
hole at the half.
Despite the deficit, the Tar­
tans had scored a season high
for first-half points in confer­
ence play.
The Spartans picked up 
right where they left off as 
they began the second half 
with a 12-2 run, putting the 
Tartans’ deficit at 64^-36. Case 
never looked back, and the 
closest Carnegie Mellon got 
to their opponents was when 
they trailed 76-62, with 2:03
to go in the game.
Roll was one of the bright 
spots for the Tartans on Satur­
day as she shot eight-for-eight 
from the line in the first half, 
along with her eight rebounds. 
Roll ended her final collegiate 
game with a career-best 22 
points and 15 rebounds.
Other strong perform­
ers for the Tartans included
Peel, who had a career-best 17 
points and 10 rebounds, and 
sophomore Jennifer Larsen, 
who scored 13.
Despite their losing record, 
the Tartans’ season was an im­
provement over their 2008-09 
performance. They will look 
for better luck and further 
improvement when their next 
season begins in the fall.

Sophomore Laura Chen 
shared her teammate’s senti­
ments. “I think we all need to 
straighten out our priorities 
and work together as a team
to make these losses a distant 
past. We have our spring break 
trip next week and another 
round of matches — a chance 
for redemption. ”
“We completely forgot the 
significance of‘national’ when 
we went to this national team
championship,” Tapak said. 
“These teams were very tough 
and we just got outplayed. But 
it’s still early in the season, so 
we can move forward from 
this point. We know what our 
weaknesses are and we can fo­
cus on getting better.”
The Tartans will travel to 
Claremont, Calif, over spring 
break to take on a series of 
tough opponents and hope to 
prove themselves once again.

Swim and dive ends season with ECAC Championships at U. Pitt
DEVIN BEAHM
Staffwriter
This past weekend, the 
Carnegie Mellon men’s and 
women’s swimming and div­
ing team competed at the 
University of Pittsburgh in the 
East Coast Athletic Conference 
(ECAC) Championships.
The Tartans kicked off 
their meet on the second day 
of competition. The first* event, 
the women’s 200-yard medley 
relay, with the team of first- 
year Dorothy Yu, first-year 
Breanna Stillo, junior Molly 
Evans, and junior Brianne 
Burton, were disqualified. The 
next event Carnegie Mellon 
competed in was the women’s 
200-yard freestyle, with first- 
year Sarah Musial placing 
47th with a time of 2:02.56 in 
the preliminaries. In the men’s 
200-yard freestyle, junior Josh
Mathews placed eighth in the 
preliminaries with a time of 
1:42.24, a time fast enough to 
qualify for the ‘A’ finals, where 
he placed seventh with a time 
of 1:41.86, a season best. First- 
year Breanna Stillo placed 
13th in the preliminaries of 
the women’s 100-yard breast­
stroke with a time of 1:06.97, 
along with senior Sara An­
drews swimming in a time of 
1:07.55 and placing 17th.
Mathews started off the 
meet for Carnegie Mellon on 
Sunday, swimming the men’s 
100-yard freestyle and plac­
ing 16th in the preliminaries, 
with a time of 47.08, assuring 
him a spot in the ‘B’ final. In 
the women’s 200-yard breast­
stroke, Yu hit a time of 2:28.15, 
finishing 19th, and first-year 
Price Kinney placed 26th in 
the same event, touching in 
just two seconds later.
In the women’s 200-yard 
butterfly, junior Rebecca Ussai 
swam a time of 2:11.12, finish­
ing 23rd. On the men’s side, 
junior Justin Whaley placed 
16th with a time of 1:54.63, 
earning him a spot in the ‘B’ fi­
nals, while first-year Brandon 
Yee placed 20th, finishing in 
1:56.42.
“I didn’t do as well as I 
wanted to, but it felt good to 
get another race in before the 
season ended,” Yu said, re­
flecting on her season. “Even 
though only about 10 of us 
swam this weekend, the rest 
of the team came and cheered 
us on.”
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
and women’s swimming and 
diving teams will next be in 
action at the NCAA Champi­
onships March 20-23 at the 
University of Minnesota in 
Minneapolis.
U.S. hockey misses gold by a goal
COMMENTARY, from A10
what actually happened drew 
those who had never watched 
a game of hockey to their tele­
visions sets. When the United 
States defeated top-seeded 
Canada in preliminary play, it 
was the largest upset in hock­
ey history, surpassed only by 
the Miracle on Ice 30 years 
ago. In one game, the entire 
landscape of the tournament, 
along with perception towards 
U.S. hockey, shifted.
Olympic hockey is recog­
nized as being faster-paced 
and more skill-heavy than 
what fans are used to in the 
NHL. There is a higher premi­
um on puck movement with 
rules put in place to reduce 
checking and eliminate fight­
ing. Watching the best players 
in the world play under these 
conditions is something to 
behold, something first-time 
watchers have been realizing 
as they have tuned in to watch 
America’s unexpected Olym­
pic run.
The U.S. team surprised 
Canada in its first outing 
with its aggressive play, fit­
ted to the narrower North 
American rink being used in 
Vancouver. They made up for 
the talent gap that existed be­
tween them and team Canada 
by being grittier — fighting 
harder for pucks along the 
boards and constantly forcing 
the puck toward the net, ulti­
mately muscling a win from 
Canada. This, coupled with 
great goalkeeping by Ryan 
Miller, allowed them to come 
out of the round robin prelim­
inary round undefeated and
seeded first. Suddenly, Russia 
and Canada were no longer 
on track to meet in the finals 
but much earlier in the quar­
terfinals. And suddenly, Cana­
da’s chief rival was no longer 
the equally talented Russia, 
who they eventually disposed 
of easily, but the hard-playing 
United States.
What all of us were wit­
nessing was the mark of team 
competition in its purest form. 
It is impossible for one player 
to carry a team in Olympic- 
style hockey, as is the case 
at times in the NHL. With all 
participating players already 
at the highest skill level, what 
separates each team from 
the others-is their chemistry 
and ability to stick to a sound 
strategy. Team USA was able 
to play to its strengths. There 
was nothing flashy about any 
of the goals that they scored
— the hallmark of Team USA 
in these Olympics was heavy 
pressure along the boards of 
the offensive zone and crash­
ing the net. Early on, Canada 
and Russia seemed content 
with allowing their most tal­
ented players to create their 
own offense, which led to 
breathtaking goals, but both 
teams ran into trouble early 
on when they met more physi­
cal and cross-checking teams 
like the United States, Slova­
kia, and Switzerland.
The result was one of the 
most physical and close pre­
liminary roun4s in Olympic 
hockey history, setting the 
stage for one of the greatest 
hockey games ever played.
For the Americans, it was 
a story about their David to
Canada’s Goliath. And for the 
Canadians, it was a story of 
redemption. It was fitting that 
the United States and Canada 
met again in the gold medal 
game. Canada had gone on to 
score a combined 15 goals in 
the two games following their 
loss to the United States, and 
seemed to have adopted the 
aggressive play the Ameri­
cans had incorporated dur­
ing their upset. Both teams 
seemed unstoppable leading 
up to the final game, and that 
the United States was able to 
score a tying goal with 24 sec­
onds left in the final by franti­
cally crashing the net was as 
much a shock as it was, well, 
completely appropriate.
Canada, in the end, got its 
redemption, finally winning a 
hockey gold medal on home 
soil. Canada’s sudden-death 
goal was not the prettiest 
Sidney Crosby ever scored — 
fighting the puck away from 
the board and forcing a shot 
on goal — but in the end, 
results counted more than 
style.
Canadians undoubtedly 
will have been celebrating this 
victory as a nation in a way 
the United States could not 
have done. But Americans are 
surely mourning this hockey 
loss unlike any they have be­
fore. Hopefully, this gives 
Americans around the nation 
reason to start attending local 
NHL games or to pick up the 
hockey stick that is gathering 
dust in their basement. One 
would hope that this was sim­
ply the start of a cross-border 
rivalry that has up until today 
been purely one-sided.
Men’s basketball closes season

CASEY GARTH

The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
basketball team played its fi­
nal match of the season on 
Saturday, falling to the Spar­
tans of Case Western Reserve 
University 51-71.
The Tartans struggled 
through most of the season 
winning just one of their last 
18 games. The Carnegie Mel­
lon team ended the season
5-20 overall and just 1-13 in 
University Athletic Associa­
tion (UAA) play.
With the stands packed
with men’s basketball alum-' --....ni and parents, five seniors 
stepped on the court with 
high energy for their final 
game. The game was close 
early in the half, with each
team going bucket-for-bucket. 
A jumper by junior Shane Rife 
put the Tartans within one of 
the Spartans with 13:48 re­
maining in the half. However, 
over the next eight minutes 
the Tartans were held to just 
one field goal as Case Western 
Reserve improved their lead 
to 30-14. As the teams head­
ed into their locker rooms for 
the break the scoreboard read 
37-19 in favor of the visitors.
Coach Anthony Wingen 
must have sparked a fire in 
the locker room, as the Tar­
tans went on a 12-4 run to 
start the second half, pulling 
within 10 points of Case West­
ern Reserve. The 10-point 
deficit was as close as the Tar­
tans would come to taking the 
lead, as the Spartans pulled 
away for the rest of the game.
The Tartans shot just 31.1 
percent from the floor com­
pared to the Spartans’ 45 per­
cent. The Tartans, were also 
out -rebounded by the visiting 
team 45-34.
Senior Jack Anderson once 
again led the Tartans with 14 
points, followed by sopho­
more John Duhring with 13 
and Rife with 10.
While the Tartans strug­
gled this season, it was not 
all bad for Anderson, who led 
the Tartans overall in three 
categories. Anderson posted 
401 points for the season, 64 
assists, and 24 steals.
“I had a great career at Car­
negie Mellon,” Anderson said. 
“We had a lot of success over 
the years and there have been 
a lot of great players to come 
through this program.”

This past weekend, the 
Carnegie Mellon women’s 
tennis team, ranked sixth in 
Division III, traveled to DeP- 
auw University to compete in 
the ITA National Team Indoor 
Championships. Going into 
the tournament looking to 
defend their title, the Tartans 
came home with a disappoint­
ing seventh-place finish after 
defeating Johns Hopkins Uni­
versity in their final match. 
The Tartans now have a blem­
ish on their otherwise spotless 
record, and move to 5-2.
On Friday, the Tartans, 
seeded fourth in the tourna­
ment, squared off against 
number-eight Denison Uni­
versity, regarded by many to 
be one of the best teams in 
the country. The Tartans dug 
themselves; an early hole, as 
they got swept in doubles to 
immediately go down 3-0. 
With their title hopes looking 
bleaker by the second, the Tar­
tans went down without much 
fight, losing the match by an 
overall score of 8-1.
¦ First-year Alex Tapak re­
corded the lone Tartan win 
at third singles in a grueling 
three set match.
The Tartans woke up the 
next, day for an 8:30 a.m. 
match looking to bounce back 
from their disappointing loss, 
and faced Gustavus Adolphus 
College in the first round of 
the consolation bracket. The 
doubles team of junior Ashley 
Herrick and sophomore Laura 
Chen staked Carnegie Mellon 
to an early 1-0 lead by win­
ning at first doubles by a score 
of 8-3. Unfortunately for the
Tartans, they dropped the re­
maining two doubles matches 
and went into singles down 
2-1.
Chen again started off the 
scoring at first singles, cruis­
ing to a 6-0, 6-0 win. With 
a win at second singles by 
sophomore Courtney Chin,
6-2, 6-4, the Tartans were in 
pretty good shape going into 
the remaining matches. How­
ever, losses at third and fourth 
singles tightened the match 
and put Gustavus ahead. Soon 
enough, Gustavus rallied from 
deficits at fifth and sixth sin­
gles to snatch victory from the 
reeling Tartan tennis team.
After the two disappoint­
ing losses to Denison and 
Gustavus, the Tartans went 
into their seventh-place match 
against Johns Hopkins with 
a feeling of failure. However, 
this did not stop them from 
taking care of business, as the 
Tartans swept doubles behind 
a strong victory from the. new­
ly formed first doubles team of 
Chen and Chin.
Going into the singles 
matches up 3-0, the Tartans 
finished off Hopkins with a
flurry of wins by sophomore 
Cze-Ja Tam 6-2, 6-2, and ju­
nior Kelly Hart, 5-7, 6-3, 1-0 
(12-10), The Tartans forceful­
ly -ulled themselves together 
and took their only win by the 
score of 7-2.
“A lot of things went wrong 
this weekend,” Tam stated. 
“We didn’t have the right 
winning attitude the whole 
tournament, which brought 
us down. What we do from 
this point will determine our 
strength and character, not

The Tartan women’s 
basketball team has had a 
roller coaster season, start­
ing strong and hitting a few 
rough patches due to injuries 
and close-fought contests. 
One of the peaks of this ac­
tive season occurred on Feb.
12 in Skibo Gymnasium, as 
the Lady Tartans took on 
Emory University in a Uni­
versity Athletic Association 
(UAA) competition. First- 
year Brit Phillips sunk a 
buzzer-beater jump shot to 
send the game into over­
time, where Carnegie Mel­
lon clinched the victory.
Phillips’ strong presence 
on the court has fortunately 
carried over from a success­
ful high school career at Nor­
mandy High School in Parma, 
Ohio. While there, Phillips 
was a four-year varsity starter 
and a three-year captain, as 
well as the conferences Most 
Valuable Player and an All- 
Academic Athlete. Phillips 
cites her father as her most 
influential inspiration in pur­
suing her basketball passion
after she took up the sport in 
first grade. While part of the 
off-season has to be devoted 
to maintaining her fitness 
and drive to improve, Phillips 
also enjoys catching up on the 
latest television shows and 
books. She enjoys snowboard­
ing, but the lengthy basketball 
season has left it to be a hobby 
that Phillips can pursue after 
her college career.
While currently seeking 
a major in mathematical sci­
ences, Phillips is also interest­
ed in computational finance. 
Having a busy schedule has 
helped with time manage­
ment, but Phillips is defi­
nitely looking forward to the 
upcoming break: “I plan to 
sleep in as much as possible, 
and maybe earn some money 
if 1 can. But mostly just relax. 
The Cavaliers are playing the 
Celtics on March 14 [and] I’ll 
be there.”
Whether it’s leading on 
the basketball court, being 
a conscientious student or 
enjoying free time, Phillips 
seems to be fitting right in at 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
and will be taking on her next 
three years.

First-time composers showcase talent
Student compositions delight audiences at Carnegie Music Hall
This past Wednesday, listeners gathered at Carnegie 
Music Hall in Oakland to celebrate the work of 
Carnegie Mellon’s most talented composers. Senior 
undergraduates and second-year master’s students 
studying composition unveiled, through music 
performed by the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic, 
their original full-orchestra pieces.
The show opened with a piece written by senior 
composition major Michael Claypool titled “So It 
Goes." The piece appropriately alluded to the late 
Kurt Vonnegut’s 1969 classic Slaughterhouse-Five, 
in which the novel’s protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, 
uses the axiom "So it goes” in several distinctive 
circumstances. The phrase, which appears 116 
times within Vonnegut’s book, is one of the author’s 
most popular lines.
In the concert’s printed program, Claypool wrote, 
“The piece is meant to be a celebration of life, 
beginning, appropriately, at death.” He explained 
how his music not only explores Pilgrim’s 
understanding of death, but also the different 
aspects of life that all of us have come to both enjoy 
and endure.
The piece itself was. fast-paced, full of syncopated 
rhythms and relentless beats. Listeners were able 
to identify Claypool’s wit within the music, but 
still distinguish the various imperative messages it 
contained.
“I enjoyed Claypool’s piece the most,” first-year 
biology major Shruti Valjee said. "I myself am a huge 
fan of Vonnegut, and I found the overall eccentricity 
of the piece to be the most compelling."
Next, sophomore music major Emma Steele took ' 
the stage to perform Russian composer Sergei 
Prokofiev’s masterpiece Violin Concerto No. 2 in 
G minor, Op. 63. Although not a composer, Steele, 
who won the concerto competition as a first-year 
last year, easily wowed the audience with her 
performance.
“I especially liked the third movement because it 
was exciting and had a lot of rhythm changes,” 
first-year violin major Clara Treadway said. 'Tm 
sure Emma could have performed ‘Old McDonald' 
and I would have loved it. She is such an incredible 
performer.”
The concert continued with a composition, left 
unnamed in the concert’s program, put together 
by second-year graduate student Chad Robinson. 
Robinson, who received his undergraduate degree in 
music composition from the University of Houston, 
created a relatively contemporary piece for his 
audience that contrasted well with the otherwise
more conventional performances of the night.
Senior music major Scott Wasserman’s piece Aoede 
was the last to be performed. The piece, named 
after the Greek Muse of song, was inspired by Greek 
mythology and Wasserman’s own understanding of 
what it feels like to dream. These influences were 
most certainly apparent as Wasserman’s music was 
both whimsical and dreamlike, and the reverie that 
Wasserman created proved to be the perfect tranquil 
ending to an otherwise brisk evening.
"This concert was a great opportunity for the 
composers to have the pieces premiered,” Treadway 
said. "This was the first time that some of these 
students got to showcase their self-written pieces."
Those members of the Carnegie Mellon community 
who attended this concert were given the 
opportunity to see the efforts of their fellow 
students recognized. All in all, the pieces written 
and performed by these students were not only 
beautiful, but also extremely inspiring. Surely, when 
a student body may be motivated by the success of 
their colleagues, a campus can be expected to feel a 
sense of triumph.

Everything you need to know
On Facebook and female finding

Students displayed a wide range of talents at last 
Wednesday's concert at Carnegie Music Hall.
I’ve been Facebook- 
stalking this cute girl in 
one of my classes — I 
know it sounds creepy 
but, come on, everyone 
does it. Turns out we have 
a lot in common. How do 
I move off Facebook and 
into real life?
—You have one new friend 
request
Dear Friend Request,
First, you need to ask yourself 
one thing: Are you hot? If you 
are, don’t worry — you’re not 
a stalker. All you have to do is 
walk up to her and introduce 
yourself. Of course, since 
you’re a guy at Carnegie 
Mellon, the answer to the 
previous question is probably 
no. Don’t try to argue — you 
know it’s true. Just keep one 
rule in mind when talking to 
girls: Don’t be creepy. Just 
repeat that over and over in 
your head and maybe take 
deep slow breaths while you 
do it.
Here’s the deal — never use 
some information you found 
out about her on Facebook. 
Facebook-stalking is creepy. 
When you do choose to 
approach your girl, act as 
if you’ve never stalked her. 
Start sitting near her in class 
and strike up a conversation 
one day, maybe make a joke 
about your teacher. Just be 
yourself — you know you 
have something in common, 
and she’ll figure that out too.
Or you could always start 
actually stalking her. That’s 
always fun.

bird watchers,

I recently went to a 
party at the University of

—In the Pitts
Dear Pitts,
Your first problem is that 
you’re a Carnegie Mellon 
student, and thus, Pitt girls 
are instantly repulsed by you. 
The solution: Pretend you’re 
a Pitt student. Start by taking 
off your cape and maybe 
hopping in the shower. 
If anyone asks, you’re a 
“communications” major. If 
you want to pass yourself off 
as a Pitt kid, you’re gonna 
have to learn about sports.
Keep in mind, though, 
you’re still a Carnegie Mellon 
student, so you’re still ugly. 
Don’t try to fly too close to 
the sun — those Pitt girls 
will bum you, and I don’t 
just mean that burning when 
you pee. Despite all the talk 
about how hot Pitt girls are, 
you might find you’ll have 
more fun and enjoy yourself 
more with a nice Carnegie 
Mellon girl. I mean, do you 
really want a girl whose head 
is like the Hindenburg — full 
of hot air?
Or, as suggested before, you 
could just take up stalking. 
I hear Point Park has some 
cuties.
Put a new swing in your 
step, 
—Brian Hoskins

Tales from abroad: Padua
Follow this student as she works with victims of human trafficking in Italy
"Aurelia, how would you say 'Stefano has a fever and 
a stomach ache’?” inquired my Italian professor Janice 
Vairo during class as we discussed the proper ways 
to ask for medical care in a foreign land. Nine in the 
morning always made me sad and flustered.
Why does she always use that name for her examples?
So what if I can’t express Stefano’s diagnosis? I had 
already learned a lot more on my own trip to Italy than 
the formalities of the language.
I spent three weeks in Padua, just outside of Venice, 
during the summer of 2008. Despite its distance in my 
memory, it is still my most leaned-on topic of discussion. 
Some say that everyone has a moment in life that defines 
time for them: before 9/11, after the JFK assassination, 
before their children were born, and so on. For me, I say 
it was when I went to Italy and lived with nuns and sex 
slaves.
My high school offered many opportunities for adding to 
one’s college resume. One opportunity was the Parkin 
Fellowship, a selective grant for students who desired to 
carry out environmental or service projects around the 
globe. This truly is a wonderful program; it brought me 
to the most life-changing and mind-altering place I have 
ever known. Until you live in hiding, until you see hope 
among the most tormented souls, you can never truly 
know yourself.
My Parkin Fellowship was a rather unique project. I 
desired more than anything to work with victims of 
human trafficking. Having done extensive research on 
this industry that earns $9 billion annually, an economy 
overlooked and unnoticed by the American populace, I 
felt compelled to have my hand in seeing an end to this 
injustice, or at least bring some happiness to the lives of 
these tortured young women.
I was scared, petrified even, when I was informed by 
the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor, who were graciously 
hosting me, that I would be living in a safe house 
patrolled on the hour by police officers guaranteeing that
the women living there would not be abducted again.
All I kept thinking was that Liam Neeson would not be 
coming to rescue me, that I would be lost in this web 
of red lights for the rest of my bound-to-be-brief life, if 
anything were to happen.
But my fear subsided as I entered the tram at the 
Pittsburgh airport, no longer able to see my mother. I 
imagined her, Au Bon Pain in hand, frightened, watching 
her 17-year-old daughter prepare to traverse an ocean to 
live the life of a foreign prostitute. If a mother can trust 
her daughter, I should trust myself, I thought.
I had huge plans to change the world. I wanted to patrol 
the streets at two in the morning, handing out condoms 
and brochures on STD and AIDS testing. I wanted to 
counsel the women in the safe house on self-esteem and 
post-traumatic stress. I wanted to babysit their children 
and teach them English. I wanted to see every aspect 
of the legal system that oppressed them and inform the 
masses of these injustices. I wanted to feed the people 
who were homeless as a result of this industry. Most of 
all, I wanted to put faces to the issue and humanize them 
in my mind. But while I was able to achieve almost all of 
these — the nuns actually helped me pass out condoms 
to the street hookers, which was especially incredible 
considering that strict Catholics object to birth control
— I was unable to bring them joy. They had found it 
themselves.
My education in human trafficking started the instant I 
exited the plane. Sister Wilma, in her habit so I could find 
her easily, stood waiting for me in the airport in Venice. 
She took my luggage, led me to a Volvo, and drove down 
the highway at hair-raising speeds. The women I would 
be living with were mostly Nigerian, Wilma told me, 
taken from their tribes and homes after pimps came into 
their villages disguised as foreign travelers. These pimps 
would build trust and offer jobs to the oldest daughters in 
each home. Nigeria, being a poor nation, is a very easy 
target for this form of attack, seeing as the families are 
willing to give up one child in an effort to build financial 
stability for the rest. Once smuggled into Italy, these
supposedly trustworthy men sell the girls to madams for 
staggering profits, leaving their promises for brighter 
futures and busying finance in the dust.
It was hard for me not to cry when I met these girls. 
Knowing the torment they have been through — being 
beaten by captors, forced to have sex with endless 
numbers of patrons while starved and sedated — I could 
not help but feel their happiness was a cover. But they 
truly were happy people. The more I talked to them, the 
more I saw that all the hope they needed was in the 
escape. Even just hearing the girls describe what they 
had been through brought me to tears. I soon understood 
that life was only bound to get better for them, that 
the future was blindingly brighter than their pasts and 
therefore they rejoiced in the most mundane things.
They bought me a soccer ball, calling me a stupid 
American for not having brought one with me, and we 
played in the vineyard for hours. I quickly realized that 
the maturity I expected from these girls was not there. 
They longed for the time they missed, clung to me like 
flies to honey for my youthful exuberance and “normal" 
childhood. My friendship was all they wanted, not my 
help or my pity. Through that bond of mutual respect 
and love, we found a common ground, an under standing, 
unlike any I have ever known. I saw the other side, and I 
loved myself more because of it.
I served in a way that is beautiful in its rawest form. I 
served myself by finding out who I am, by learning the 
true meaning of hope, by experiencing self-sacrificing 
love, by putting my life on the line for a cause worth 
fighting for. I am a new woman, and always will be. And 
that is one thing that no Italian class can give me. So I 
may not know how to say Stefano has a headache and 
needs to see a doctor, but I know a lot more. That has 
changed my life.

Album explores facets of love
Mystery, excitement, and agitation: Joanna Newsom’s latest has it all
"Easy.”
The first word that pushed through her lips is not 
an accurate description of Joanna Newsom’s latest 
album. The project includes three discs clocking 
in at over two full hours of music, with many songs 
over seven minutes long, from a songwriter who 
eschews the concept of the refrain like the plague.
So let me take you on a voyage. Four years after 
Newsom’s Ys, we have abandoned that mythical 
city consumed by the sea, the doves stuffed with 
sawdust and diamonds, the exploited dancing bear, 
and have been given an album focused on love.
From start to finish Newsom has created an 18-song 
tribute to love — expectant or unrequited, magical 
or pragmatic, just on the verge of beginning or 
already-ended love.
As an aside, I can’t discuss the emotional 
consternation I have with trying to accept that much 
of the beauty and raw love in this album may have 
been somehow provoked by Saturday Night Live 
digital-short star Andy Samberg. To me this will 
likely always remain the greatest mystery of this 
album.
You should open the package and place the first disc 
in your music player. If you have a digital edition, 
start with the first six songs. From the opener 
through much of the first disc (ignoring the slow 
and folky “No Provenance”) we are seeing a new 
Newsom, slightly peppy, often straightforward, with 
catchy quirky lines (I was repeating “like a bump 
on a bump on a log, baby” for hours). Both “’81” and 
“Good Intentions Paving Company” are transformed 
pop songs passed through a filter of Newsom’s voice 
and harp. The first disc alone, for many artists, would 
be an accomplished album. Actually, given the 
standards of today’s recording industry, the disc’s 
final track — “Baby Birch” — is more than most 
artists ever even aim for: a nine-and-a-half-minute 
song that is truly art. And that is just the first disc.
But here you might need a break. Newsom said this 
was easy, but you need to give it time, take a nap, 
wait a day. Have a drink on her. Listen to the first CD 
a few times, learn the rhythm and patterns in those 
first six stories before pushing on.
The second disc is more of a mystery to me. It 
pulls you'in fast but really expresses itself on “In 
California," where Newsom, in the darkness of the 
night, turns herself into a cuckoo clock. Everyone 
has a method for dealing with the uncertainty of 
love; don’t knock hers. Then you just have three 
more tracks to pretend to understand before you can 
move on to the third disc.
The final six songs are risky but rewarding. The
start is filled with lawlessness (you will know what 
I mean); "Esme” and "Autumn" are seductive and 
caring, and “Kingfisher” is Newsom’s storytelling 
at its peak. But it is the end that makes this 
whole thing worth it. The final track, “Does Not 
Suffice," is a tear-jerking yet subdued story of the 
now-ex-girlfriend packing up and moving out. 
Newsom’s mix of lavishly described clothing being 
packed compared to the starkness of the empty 
apartment: “The tap of hangers swaying in the 
closet / Unburdened hooks and empty drawers /
And everywhere I tried to love you / Is yours again 
and only yours.” This accepted loss followed by an 
agitated musical outro that is really the best possible 
ending for this journey. One that pushes you right 
back in.
The difficulty in enduring a three-disc album 
is lightened partially by Newsom sticking to 
somewhat simpler lyrics, though her eccentric 
touch still lingers: the storytelling in “Baby Birch”
("A tarantula's mounting Countess Lansfeld’s 
handsome brassiere, while they all cheer”), the title 
track explorations (“I roam around the tidy grounds 
of my dappled sanatorium"), or the obviousness of 
“her faultlessly etiolated fishbelly-face.” But even 
with these examples (and trust me, there are more) 
withstanding, this is Newsom’s most inviting effort 
yet. Each of these songs has a story, has lyrical and 
musical constructions that won’t be exposed on the 
first listen. I have no doubt that this album will in 
time earn its highly regarded and deserved place in 
Newsom’s growing canon, but to believe that, you 
may have to give it days of your time. I can only try 
to make you believe that it is worth it.
I won’t end with some sort of meta-lecture 
on how it is possible to transcend the cliche 
that is the concept album, bucking traditional 
three-and-a-half-minute songs, and producing 
something that is musically and artistically 
rewarding. I won’t do that; I will just mention it so 
you know it is true and that it is your responsibility 
as an indie connoisseur, a university hipster, or a 
harpist to listen to this album (all of it), and when 
you find it grating, to listen to it again for me. And 
then one more time — the last one is on her.

On music and art
Music and visual art have always shared a connection, but in 
this modern age, art and music are meeting on different terms. 
In the past, it has often been the prerogative of the visual 
artist to interpret the musician, but today, more musicians are 
realizing their own visual interpretations.
Radiohead's 2009 single “These Are My Twisted Words” 
was released with a series of images that could be overlaid 
to produce a variety of different album covers. The Arcade 
Fire’s music video for their single “Neon Bible” was made 
completely interactive on the band’s website. Depending on 
where a person clicked on the page, he or she could interact 
with the music video character in different ways.
These combinations of art and music have expanded to 
large-scale art performances and installations as well. Last 
year, the BAM Next Wave Festival commissioned Bryce 
Dessner, Aaron Dessner, and Matthew Ritchie to produce a 
musical about the dawn of time that would go hand in hand 
with their gallery of sculptures and images. The performance 
was radical and the art exploratory. To date, I cannot imagine 
a more inspiring collaboration of music and art.
On March 4, the realms of music and art will once again 
blend when Animal Collective opens their new installation and 
musical performance at Manhattan’s Guggenheim Museum. 
The project, entitled Transverse Temporal Gyrus, will feature 
the works of artist Danny Perez and promises to be a stunning 
blend of sounds and art as well as a truly psychedelic 
experience. It is one of the most anticipated collaborations 
between art and music, and with the success of Animal 
Collective’s recent album, Merriweather Post Pavilion, the 
show is guaranteed to be spectacular.
These advances in the combination of visual art and music 
are allowing artists to truly explore the boundaries of their 
medium. We look forward to seeing future collaborations in 
this arena.

Moakler returns to his hometown for a final show
The Three Amigos finish their tour with an interactive show at Diesel Club Lounge
Last Thursday, Diesel Club Lounge in the South Side 
hosted a spectacular display of talent. The Three Amigos 
Tour, which consists of three young, soulful singer- 
songwriters, has been traveling throughout the eastern 
states, and this performance marked its Pittsburgh 
debut. The three performers, along with another talented 
opening act, provided over two hours of quality music 
for the 100 or so spectators. Club Diesel itself puts its 
audience 50 feet from the performers, giving the show an 
intimate appeal.
The first opening act of Thursday’s concert was 
Plane Pilot, a keyboard-drum-bass-guitar quartet of 
20-somethings. The band’s vocalist and style are 
reminiscent of Better Than Ezra, with an infusion of 
blues. "The Sun” was romantic with a strong box guitar 
sound, while "The After Affair” relied on a piano-driven 
beat. Their song “Kaleidoscope” could best be described 
as ’70s piano funk, with the last two minutes of the song 
devoted to pure guitar and drum solos.
After Plane Pilot came the first of the Three Amigos: Ben 
Rector. Easily comparable to Jamie Lidell and at times 
sounding like Caleb Followill, lead singer of the Kings of 
Leon, Rector is incredibly bluesy. His opening number 
was "The Feeling,” in which he asked the audience 
for some help. He explained that the chorus involved 
repeating the words "the feeling" a few times, and soon 
enough, he had dozens of singers helping him out. Next 
up was “Your Heart is a Lonely One," which placed 
beautiful words on top of incredibly catchy guitar riffs. 
The infectious beat kept the crowd moving.
Another of Rector’s songs was “Loving You is Easy,” 
which had a tropical feel due to the Caribbean-fusion 
percussion instruments. Rector once again asked for

states with a lively performance in the South Side.
the help of the audience, this time inviting a request for 
something for him to sing about in his next song. As a 
result, he ended up singing about Steve Moakler's hair. 
Rector closed his set with “Hank,” a beautiful piano 
ballad written for his young nephew.
Next, Chicago native Andrew Ripp took the stage.
Ripp began his set by singing “Peace Like a River,” 
a charming piano ballad written about his wife. His 
next song, "Savior,” was written after he performed 
for soldiers overseas and met with a soldier in Norway 
named Marty. He humorously explained that the song 
wasn’t “about them,” but he feels that Marty "might 
like it.” Another song, titled “The Privileged Life,” was 
extremely eclectic, evolving from heavy electric guitar 
riffs and requiring that the audience shout "Hey!” in 
unison. In a climactic and unexpected ending, Ripp 
broke out a kazoo.
Ripp incorporated the “Pants on the Ground” song from 
American Idol into his own set, creating an unforgettable 
moment. He also chose to end his set with a beautiful 
piano ballad, this one written for his mother. The song, 
“Dresden Wine,” was played masterfully; his vocals were 
flawless and emotional, while his piano was haunting.
Last but most certainly not least was the headlining act, 
Steve Moakler. Returning to his hometown, Moakler was 
greeted with enthusiastic fans who sang along to each 
of his song selections. After arriving on stage eating a 
banana, he quickly began with the energetic “True Like 
Your Name,” while singing engaging lyrics like "Love is 
the worst, you can't explain / But once you feel it inside, 
you’re not the same.” Next on the set list was "Where 
You Belong," followed by “Stay Sound.”
Moakler explained that the next song, “Boy That You 
Drew," was written about a girl that he never met. The 
lyrics to this song are clever, while Moakler confesses 
that he’s not like the ideal guy his special someone 
has been dreaming about. He sings, "There’s no one to 
blame / Please place the fault on the game / Your heart's 
bound to wear different names.”
The next tune, "18," started out soft, gradually building 
up to a vivacious ending. Rector, on keyboard, 
accidentally started the song off on the wrong note.
After Moakler restarted the song, Rector smiled and 
apologized, as they went on to deliver another great 
performance.
After singing “Happy Birthday” to two members of the 
audience, Moakler proceeded into a strictly acoustic 
version of the fan favorite "Run." Dozens sang along with 
Moakler, crooning “How many times do you set love free 
/ Before you know it’s supposed to be? / And how long 
do you wait and see / Before you know to run to me?”

Steve Moakler performed at Diesel Club Lounge last 
Thursday.
Next on the set list was "Hesitate,” which was actually 
featured on an episode of Private Practice. One of the 
song’s verses compares taking a chance to a game of 
cards: "And I've never been a gambling man / But if 
you want to see my hand / Ask me now and I won’t 
hesitate.” Following it was “False Alarms” and then “All 
the Faint Lights," which was accompanied by vivid blue, 
green, and red lights flashing on the stage backdrop.
The closing song was “Slo-Mo,” to which the audience 
sang along for the song’s entirety. Toward the end of the 
tune, the music stopped and Moakler looked to his other 
Amigos, asking if they had fun on their tour. After he got 
satisfying answers from both guys, the music started 
back up for an exciting and lively finish.
When Moaker left the stage, the crowd almost 
immediately began chanting for an encore. He promptly 
and delightfully returned to the stage to deliver two more 
songs before checking out for the night.
All the artists who played at Diesel weren’t afraid to let 
loose and have a good time with the crowd. Every one 
of these men are young, talented, passionate, and will 
without a doubt see success on the road ahead of them.

Loose story lines, shabby costuming, and mediocre acting
TV movies represent the ways low budgets can ruin filmmaking
On specialized channels like Oxygen, ABC Family, 
and BET, the made-for-TV movie makes its 
comfortable home. Pop culture often mocks the 
“Lifetime movie” — rife with the same stories about 
abused women who fight back at the men who are 
oppressing, suppressing, and repressing them.
Made-for-TV movies are easy targets for criticism; after 
all, these films are typically low-budget, often starring 
B-list (or worse) actors who used to sell tabloids but now 
are lucky if they get any mention at all.
Take I Do... I Did as an example. This movie, released in 
August 2009 and aired on BET, is so undervalued that it 
doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page.
The cast of I Do... I Did includes Cherie Johnson, known 
primarily as Laura’s best friend on ABC’s Family Matters, 
and Shar Jackson, who played Neicy on UPN’s Moesha. 
The storyline was quick and the costumes shabby; 
it seemed as if the actresses and actors had chosen 
clothing from their own wardrobes.
The story follows the relationship between Marcus, 
played by Marcus Patrick, and Vivian, played by 
Johnson, who also wrote and produced the film. On 
the way to their honeymoon, the couple gets into a 
serious car accident. Vivian slips into a coma and is 
incapacitated for two years. Vivian’s best friend Candy, 
played by Jackson, comes to visit Vivian in the hospital 
every day, even after Vivian’s own husband stops 
visiting a year later.
When Vivian finally wakes up, Marcus has gotten
remarried. Since Vivian’s family died while she was 
in the coma, Candy is now all she has. When Vivian 
finally leaves the hospital, she is forced to wear the 
wedding dress she was admitted to the ER wearing.
The costuming is so bad that the blood on the dress still 
appears fresh.
Vivian is now forced to move into Marcus’ house with 
him and his new pregnant wife, Jenny, played by April 
Scott. At first, Jenny doesn’t seem to care that Vivian is 
there, but the tension starts to grow as Vivian attempts 
to show Marcus that this should be her life, not Jenny’s. 
Marcus now has to try to manage two wives under one 
roof.
This plot leaves serious issues for nearly any viewer, 
of course. Marcus was able to remarry without having 
to produce Vivian’s death certificate and, in the end, 
Marcus realized he is still in love with Vivian just in time, 
as luck would have it, for Jenny to fall into a coma.
But TV movies do more than just throw together poorly 
thought-out plots with barely remembered actors.
In 2004, The Prince and Me premiered in theaters 
to mediocre reviews, although avid Julia Stiles and/ 
or romantic comedy fans will likely list it among their 
favorites. In 2006, ABC Family took this relatively 
adorable movie and ran it through the sequel machinery 
to produce The Prince and Me U: The Royal Wedding. 
Luke Mably, as Prince Edvard, is the only cast member 
to return to this low-budget sequel.
In this second installment, moments before Edvard is to 
marry Paige and take up the throne as king, the Danish
Parliament finds an old law requiring that the prince 
marry a woman of noble blood. As if on cue, Kirsten, a 
princess who was friends with Edvard when the two 
were little, comes to visit, and it just so happens that she 
wants to marry Edvard. He is only too happy to follow 
through with this plan, until Paige finds a loophole that 
lets her marry Edvard after all.
Even after the easily forgettable actors and barely 
memorable scenes were through, there came a third 
version (cleverly subtitled A Royal Honeymoon), this 
time shucking Mably in favor of unknown Chris Geere
— an only slightly more unimpressive lookalike of Mably, 
who has yet to find another film to renew his relevance. 
Even IMDb cannot come up with a better plot synopsis 
than "King Edvard and Queen Paige set out on their 
honeymoon."
What’s even more shocking is that a fourth one is on its 
way, titled The Prince & Me: The Elephant Adventure. 
Leave it to made-for-TV movies to wring out every cent 
of profit from an initially promising concept.

Body art culture redefines free expression
Tattoos, piercings, and hair styles allow people to use their bodies creatively and express themselves

Jason Lambert, a tattoo artist, inks body art at Black Cat Tattoos on Craig Street.
events, and they have appeared in numerous societies 
all around the world.
Today in America, people seem to get tattoos for a 
variety of reasons, sometimes to mark a meaningful 
occasion or even simply as a way to acquire a new, 
distinct accessory. So even though they might not be 
used for magical purposes today, people still use them to 
express themselves. And though amulets and talismans 
aren’t often seen on forearms and necks, the occasional 
wizard makes an appearance. “I’ve done, like, 20 wizards 
a few years ago." McQuade said, shaking his head. This 
influx of sorcerers probably coincided with the release of 
the Harry Potter movies.
Pop culture influences tattoo choices today as well.
Many people use their bodies to show their interests, 
choosing designs ranging from wizards to band names 
to profiles of Michael Jackson and Bugs Bunny. Pop 
culture, religion, and loved and lost ones all inspire 
tattoos. Of course, people get tattoos for more serious 
and personal reasons as well. First-year music'major

The definition of art has been an area of contention 
possibly from the very first time someone hung a portrait 
on a wall. Over the years, countless talented artists 
and art appreciators have struggled to come up with 
a universally accepted answer, arguing for broader or 
narrower definitions of art according to their own beliefs 
about creativity and expression.
One definition that may be a little easier to pin down is 
that of body art. “That’s basically anything you can do to 
express yourself, using your own body,” tattoo artist Josh 
McQuade said as he bent intently over the calligraphic 
axe design he was drawing. “Anything body, hair, 
piercings — any way you can express yourself by using 
yourself."
McQuade has been a tattoo artist for 18 years and 
currently works at Jester's Court on Oakland Avenue. As 
he sketched at the front desk, a man entered the shop, 
bringing a gust of snow and a piece of paper clutched 
in his hand. He greeted McQuade and showed him the 
paper — it was an ornate dragonfly. An appointment 
was made and the man left, leaving the design for 
McQuade to study. “Everyone is different. You can never
guess what anyone’s going to get when they first walk 
in,” he remarked.
The new customer seemed like the type to want a 
skull emblazoned on his bicep, rather than a dragonfly. 
This method of stereotyping that comes with society’s 
perspective on body art and tattoos often masks the 
meaning behind this art.
“This one probably has a story behind it,” McQuade 
announced. “It looks like a Maori style. Most of them 
have stories, but sometimes you get a kid who comes 
in and asks me to put whatever I want on him. I usually 
gave those people chicken wings.”
Jack London once said, “Show me a man with a tattoo, 
and I’ll show you a man with an interesting past." 
People throughout history have used tattoos as a way 
of communicating something about themselves. Maori 
tattoos signified a person’s status and rank, marking 
rites of passage and significant events. Yantra tattooing 
in Thailand supposedly gives protection and magical 
powers to the wearer.
Over the years, tattoos have served as talismans, status 
symbols, family associations, and markers of significant

People tend to have varied interests when it comes to choosing designs for tattoos. A number of factors, including pop culture,
tend to influence the decisions behind choosing these designs.
on her wrists. “They are for no particular reason, but I 
had been thinking about it for a while before I decided 
to get them,” she said. “I knew I wanted something 
religious, and I thought through several different ideas 
before finally ending up with the one I have.”
Roberts confidently acknowledged that she thinks 
her body art accurately portrays who she is. On the 
definition of body art, Roberts’ response was similar to 
McQuade's: “I think body art is simply decorating your 
body to express yourself. I don’t think it necessarily 
refers to tattoos.”
Piercings also have a long and extensive history and 
symbology, and people today have adapted this form 
of body art to include gauges, bars, and other types 
of metalwork, fylost people today, especially women, 
subscribe to this type of body art in the form of ear 
piercing, although many others have piercings on other 
body parts as well — nose and navel piercings are also 
fairly common, and eyebrows, lips, or any other body 
part that can be subject to piercing can be spotted. 
Although not as expressive as a picture on a forearm, 
many claim that piercing is a form of body art as well.
Following this broad definition of body art, body art 
can also include procedures much less permanent than 
tattoos and piercings. Hair dyeing is a fairly common, 
inexpensive, and temporary form of body art. Many 
people dye their hair typical colors like auburn or blond, 
but atypical colors like pink and blue can also be a form 
of self-expression.
Recently, crazy hair colors have been appearing in high 
fashion and blogger circles. Proenza Schouler, Comme 
des Garçons, and Chanel have all featured models with 
pastel and neon hair in their 2010 spring or summer- 
collections. Icy blues and cotton-candy pinks seem 
to be inspiring designers and fashion followers alike.
But whether you follow fashion, are taking a tip from 
Clementine from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, 
or have always secretly had a desire for unique and 
imaginative hair, dyeing is a fun way to experiment with
your style and way of expressing yourself.
In spite of its relative popularity, body art is still a subject 
of contention in society. It is true that piercings and 
tattoos are very permanent procedures.
While some people take the use of art on their bodies 
seriously and plan the meaning behind each procedure, 
to some it isn’t extremely meaningful at all, and only a 
new way to add some excitement to their daily look, akiA 
to a bold new haircut.
It has also been argued that unlike a canvas, your body is 
not a disposable medium, and it should not be treated as 
such. Many think that art should be saved for paper and 
pencils, not skin and needles.
A bad drawing on a piece of paper can be thrown away 
and a new one can be used in its place — what happens 
if a tattoo turns out badly, or if your feelings about it 
change in the next few years, or if you get it for the 
entirely wrong reasons?
Though this is an argument against permanent body art, 
it could also be used to support the opposite position. 
Doesn’t the permanence of the message, whatever it 
is, heighten the meaning and the experience of it as a 
whole? Whether a biblical quote or a smiley face, it’s an 
experience that can’t be erased or thrown away as easily 
as a piece of paper.
Whether you support the idea of body art or think that 
art should be reserved for the canvas, at least appreciate 
people who truly take the time and effort to try to 
understand who they are and portray it to the world.
Whether it'be neon green hair or a dragonfly on a bicep, 
understand that someone is purposefully trying to 
convey something about themselves, and while Daffy 
Duck may not be the interesting past that Jack London 
had in mind, it’s definitely a conversation starter.

Designers revolutionize runway for Fashion Week 2010
For those of us who follow fashion, February is a 
big month. New lines are released, stores stock for 
the new season, and shoppers begin adjusting their 
wardrobes for the spring. For fashion enthusiasts 
in New York City and several other cities, February 
translates to one thing: fashion week. Fashion week 
is when fashion designers and brands display their 
latest seasonal collections in various runway shows 
throughout the city. Many shows are invite-only 
and are often flooded by journalists, editors, buyers, 
stylists, and celebrities alike.
Historically, New York City, London, Milan, and 
Paris have often been regarded as the major fashion 
week cities. There are two fashion week seasons 
that are intended to anticipate trends in advance: 
From February to March designers showcase 
their autumn and winter collections, and from 
September to November their spring and summer 
collections. These early shows allow buyers and 
media representatives to preview the looks for 
the upcoming season and prepare appropriately. 
Retailers and publications can incorporate the trends 
into the upcoming months of preparation.
New York Fashion Week
So far, one of the most notable shows has been Marc 
Jacobs’. Jacobs is the creative director at Louis 
Vuitton, but he also designs and manages his own 
line. Throughout the years, Jacobs has consistently 
presented impressive lines for New York Fashion 
Week, and this year was no exception. However, 
peculiarly enough, Jacobs decided to ban celebrities 
from sitting in the front row of his runway show 
this year. Considering his past collaborations with 
Victoria Beckham and Sofia Coppola, this was quite 
surprising.
Jacobs’ most recent collection can be summarized 
in two words: pure and simple. He opened his 
show by tearing down a brown construction paper 
curtain to reveal his models, who then walked down 
the runway one by one to a Juliette Greco cover 
of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow." His collection 
consisted of a neutral palette — including shades of 
gray, beige, and cream with flashes of sweet yellows. 
Fur was a key material in Jacobs’ collection, along 
with tipped Mary Jane shoes and knee-length skirts. 
Jacobs created pieces for the everyday woman. Joe 
Zee, creative director of Elle magazine, said in an 
interview with the Associated Press that Jacobs’ 
line was made of “gorgeous, real clothes that were 
beautifully done.”
On another note, it looks like New York Fashion 
Week will be subject to some change next year. 
Since 1993 the events have been held at Bryant 
Park. However, starting next year, New York Fashion
Week will be in Damrosch Park at the Lincoln Center 
Complex.
London Fashion Week
The fashion industry lost a celebrated English 
designer with the recent death of Alexander 
McQueen. The death of McQueen, who committed 
suicide at his London home, seemed to take a toll on 
the hype and excitement of London's fashion week. 
The week’s events opened with a tribute address 
to McQueen by Sarah Brown, the wife of Prime 
Minister Gordon Brown. Despite the death of the 
designer, the label announced that his line will be 
continued.
One of London’s most impressive runway shows was 
that of luxury British line Burberry. Burberry’s show 
featured new technology that allowed people in 
London to watch the show from the Chelsea College 
of Art. The live show was simultaneously being, 
streamed around the world, with 3-D showings 
being played to audiences in New York, Paris, and 
Los Angeles. The collection is extremely sexy, 
featuring skin-tight lace and satin body-conscious 
dresses. Thigh-high leather and snakeskin boots 
were notable accessories. Burberry’s coats and 
jackets were eye catching, curling at the collar and 
reflecting a military influence. This year, London 
Fashion Week also featured many fresh designers 
such as Christopher Cane, Marios Schwab, and 
Louise Goldin. Stella McCartney also debuted her 
much anticipated collection.
Stay tuned, fashion enthusiasts. There is yet more 
fashion to come as both Milan Fashion Week and 
Paris Fashion Week are to debut in March.

Take this next week and visit the underprivileged populations

As awesome as Liberty City might seem, with its lax law 
enforcement and burgeoning black market, vacationing there 
will end with a missing kidney and an empty wallet.
This year, spend your break in London with the NHS 
collecting donor organs. It is sort of like donating your time 
to charity, and you get-to do it in London.
Use www.chatroulette.com to determine where you spend
