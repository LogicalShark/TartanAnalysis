A. J. Wurts
Professor Alexander Jay Wurts, 
first member of the faculty to be 
appointed at the Carnegie Tech- 
•nical Schools, .now Carnegie Insti­
tute of Technology, and associated 
since its inception with the Elec­
trical Engineering Department, 
passed away Thursday morning, 
January 21 at his home in the
Schenley Apartments after a two 
weeks' illness of typhoid fever.
niDuring his early 
«connection with I the Institute lie 
I was particularly 
| active i n the 
| tasks confronting 
I the .expansion of 
small school;
recent years
.r, gjhe was instru-t' ' ftPT' Hi mental in the es"**ltablishment and
¦ administration of 
fla student welfare j fund.
Professor Wurts 
| was born at Car- 
I bondalc, Pa. He 
1 was a direct de- 
] scendent, on, his 
¡'mother’s side, of 
j the first Chief 
Justice John Hay 
He received h i s 
Ph.D. degree at Yale University in 
1882, and. two year's later his ME. 
degree from the Stevens Institute 
of Technology at' Iioboken.
For twenty years he was an elec­
trical engineer with the Westing- 
house Electric and Manufacturing 
Company, and worked with the 
'late George Westinghouse on the 
development of the Nernst lamp. 
Subsequent to this research he 
was selected to head the Nernst 
Lamp Company when it was 
launched as a Westinghouse sub­
sidiary. During this period the 
Franklin Institute of Philadelphia 
awarded him the John Scott Medal 
for his inventions in lightning ar- 
rcStors and the discovery of non­
arcing metals.
Through his association with Mr. 
Westinghouse, Professor Wurts 
had become' acquainted with the 
Founder, and in 1904 was the first 
faculty member appointed here. He 
served as the head of the Depart­
ment of Electrical Engineering

A COLTL.IN OF CURIOUS COMMENT 
BY NATHAN MILLER
Words, Words, Words...
This caption does not directly 
refer to the weekly outpourings of 
this irrepressible column, although 
you can (and probably already 
have) drawn your own judgment 
on the matter.
We have in mind particularly 
the common tendency of people to 
attach themselves to certain words 
as symbols of all that is fine and 
commendable and ideal, and to 
other words as the epitome, of all 
. that is hateful, dreadful and insidi­
ous! We thus become emotionally 
bound to these slogans of good or 
ill and refuse to view them in any 
rational or , sensible .light. Thus, 
temperatures mount when we speak 
of “liberty,” the “constitution," 
“law and order,” “democracy,” 
"atheist,” “communism,” socialism,” 
"freedom of speech,” “school spir­
it,” etc. There are few who can 
remain unruffled to these expres­
sions of national or popular fervor 
(that is, few except college sopho­
mores).
Perhaps some day one of hu­
manity’s greatest benefactors and 
philanthropists will arise to endow 
institutions for the purpose of de­
bunking or at least bringing down 
to a scientifically ordered basis 
these terrible portents of popular 
feeling. Then demagogues will 
have to look elsewhere for fuel 
with which to feel the flames, and 
f/ditorial writers will not be able to 
«;p their pens into vitriol and 
spleen so often, and preachers will 
nc longer inveigh so concernedly 
OZ profane matters. This condi-

Student Directories Again 
On Sale At Y.M.C.A. Office
A limited number of student 
directories are now available for 
sale at the “Y” office. 'Because 
of the unprecedented demand for 
the directories this year, more 
copies have been obtained. The 
books will be on sale at the reg­
ular price, 50 cents.
All student, salesmen who have 
not yet made their final returns 
are requested to do so at once 
in order that the directories may 
be available for sale.
This year’s directory is the 
largest that has ever been issued 
at Carnegie. The student direc­
tory contains the names of every 
student registered at Carnegie, 
together with his school and 
home addresses, his year, and his 
college and course.
DR. HEINROTH TO 
LEAVE INSTITUTE
Famed Organist Will Assume 
New Duties in New 
York City
Dr. Charles Heinroth, Lecturer in 
Musical Aesthetics at Carnegie since 
1928, and for the past 25 years 
Organist and Director of Music at 
the Carnegie Institute, will leave this 
week for New York where he will 
assume his new duties as professor 
and head of the department of Music 
at the College of the City of New York.
In addition to his organ recitals 
and lectures at the Institute, Dr. 
Heinroth has lectured to three classes 
a week since coming to Carnegie.
His recitals and lectures number 
over eighteen hundred and have been 
attended by more than -two • million persons.
At the age- of 18’ Dr. Heinroth 
held the position of organist and 
choirmaster at the St. Paul's Epis­
copal Church iit Brooklyn. He later 
studied in Europe and on his return 
rose quickly to the position of promi­
nence in musical circles which he new holds.
He . came to' Pittsburgh, in 1907 and 
his popularity may be attributed to 
the fact that while his programs have 
always embraced some of the standard 
classics of organ music he has not 
hesitated to adapt good music from 
other fields when it was worthy of 
the interest of the musician.
MEDAL AWARDED 
TO PROF. GARNET
"In recognition of his career of 
usefulness in the Graphic Arts,” 
Professor Porter Garnet, Master of 
the Laboratory Press was awarded 
the Gold Medal- of the American 
Institute of Graphic Arts on De­
cember .16, 1931. The award is a 
measure of appreciation of his in­
terested efforts1 in this line “with 
particular emphasis on . the work he 
has done in the teaching of the art 
of printing and the stimulus he has 
provided for young men going out 
into this work.” The presentation of 
the medal will take place sometime 
during the current month, at which 
time an exhibition of the work of 
the Laboratory Press will be held in New York.
Professor Garnet has been invited 
by the “Verein Deutcher Buchkuen- 
stelor” with one hundred book print­
ers of the world, to participate, by 
printing an extract from the works 
of Goethe, in an aninversary cele­
bration in honor of Goethe to be 
held at Leipzig in April.

The Carriegie Men’s Junior Prom, 
the first important all-college formal 
of the year, will be held on Febru­
ary 12, Lincoln’s »Birthday, as a fit­
ting climax to the first semester 
social season. The English Room of
CHAIRMAN 1 h c F 0 r , P|lt Hotel will be
transformed by the 
committee into a 
setting that befits 
this major formal 
of the year.
According to the 
Prom Committee 
their choice of,
Husk O’Hare

for the revelry
J. Kronenberg has received a 
great ovation from the Carnegie stu­
dent body. Husk’s-orchcstra topped 
the list of the Junior Prom Orches­
tra Tea Dance Vote previous to the 
announcement of the Prom com­
mittee’s choice.
Early ticket sales are urged by 
the committee to facilitate the ar­
rangements for the Prom. The tick­
ets are now on sale for $6, payable 
in one installment. They may be se­
cured at the Y. M. C. A. office or
from the following junior men, all
members .of Delta Skull: John
Kroiienbcrg, chairman‘•of the Prom;

Robert A. Hutchison, Frederick
Flaherty and Louis J. Manesiotis.
The sale of tickets is not limited to 
the junior class, for all Carnegie 
students and alumni and their guests 
may attend.
According to the Prom Commit­
tee‘the English Room is as large, if 
not larger, than the settings for pre­
vious Junior Proms, so a capacity 
crowd can be handled.
Husk O’Hare and his orchestra 
furnishing the music, together with 
the lowest Junior Prom ticket price, 
in the history of the school, and the 
English Room of the Fort Pitt Hotel 
as the setting for the affair, are all 
factors that lead the Prom Commit­
tee to prepare for a record attend­
ance.The hours of the Prom are from
9 p. m. to 2 a. m. A buffet luncheon 
will be served at 11:30 and follow­
ing the Prom several social fraterni­
ties have arranged for breakfast par­
ties. Dormitory girls attending break­
fast parties are granted 4:30 permis­
sion.
In accordance with Carnegie’s cus­
tom that decrees that floral decora­
tions are to be omitted from school 
functions, corsages will be out of 
order at the Men’s Junior Prom.
The Prom Committee is trying to 
make arrangements with the Yellow 
and Green Cab Company for special 
transportation rates between the cam­
pus and the Fort Pitt for students 
attending the Prom.

Gentleman of the Air*’... born more 
than twenty years ago (don’t ask 
how much more) in Maysville,

he was fourteen years old ... comes 
from a non-musical family... but 
always wanted to be an actor or 
an orchestra leader... he is.
Lives on Chicago's West Side 
with his parents ... graduated with 
honors from Austin High School

Statistician Estimates Pecuniary
Value of College Education At $65,000
William Atherton Du Puy Cites Results of Study of 
Earning Power of Education 
in Report
Although the average college gradu­
ate is supposedly- too idealistic to 
consider the financial benefit of an
education when lie is answering that 
old question, “Why I Came to Col­
lege,” there will probably be. quite
a few who will be interested to
know that William Atherton Du Puy, 
the eminent statistician, has estimated 
that the pecuniary value of a college 
education amounts to $65,000.
While the high school graduate 
may expect to earn only $110,000 dur­
ing his life span, the college graduate 
will earn $175,000 according to the 
report of Mr. Du Puy, executive as­
sistant at the Department of the In­
terior, who has just completed a
statistical study of the earning power of education.
At 18 the high school graduate 
earns $S00 in contrast to , the boy 
with only grade school training. lie 
will not net an annual income of
$1,500 at 22 which represents the 
maximum of the average incomc of 
a man with grammar school educa­
tion. The college graduate begins to 
earn at the age of 22, reports Mr. 
Du Puy, without taking into account 
the , abnormal conditions due to the 
depression. He starts off at about 
$1,400, which is less than the high 
school graduate makes at the same 
age, because the latter has been 
working for years. The collcgc 
graduate’s incomc rises rapidly by 
the time he reaches 26 years of age, 
but that of the high school graduate 
mounts more slowly. When the two 
are between the ages of ‘13 and 48, 
the college man’s earnings' usually 
conic to a point of rapid increase and 
tjic high school trained man’s income 
is stationary arid his momentum is 
slackened. When th<v collcgc man 
reaches' 60, he is earning $4,000 a 
year, and at 70 his incomc drops to 
$3,500.
M. M. Senate Will Vote On 
New Constitution Monday
The Margaret Morrison Sen­
ate will hold a meeting Monday, 
at which Dr. Watkins will be 
present, for the purpose of vot-“ 
-ing on the. new constitution.
The constitution which had 
been used up to this time was 
adapted'to the, former method of 
.student government by which the 
entire student body of Margaret 
Morrison met to decide on im­
portant issues. As this type of 
government becainc impossible, 
because of the increasing size of 
the classes, the Senate was be­
gun. .
In the Senate, representatives 
or -the classes decide the ques­
tions which formerly the entire 
student body settled. Because of 
this change the old constitution 
had to be revised.
Phi Mu Alpha Tea 
Dance Tomorrow
WWSW Will Broadcast Part 
of Program
Phi Mu Alpha, men’s national 
honorary fraternity; will sponsor a 
tea dance in Thistle Hall tomor­
row, from 4 to 6 o’clock. This 
will be the second tea dance to be 
held in Thistle Hall.
The committee, headed by Ted 
Estabrookc, a member of Pi Kappa 
Alpha, social fraternity, has secur­
ed special permission from the 
Faculty Radio Committee to have 
a part of the musical program 
broadcast over station WWSW 
from 5:30 to 6 o’clock. This will 
be the first time music from a 
Carnegie tea dance has ever been 
broadcast.
' The music will be furnished by 
Will Ryshanck and his orchestra. 
According to the committee chair­
man, this orchestra acclaimed pop­
ular favor at the last night school 
dance. His orchestra also played 
at the Cwen tea dance, which was 
held January 13.
The proceeds of the dance will 
be used to pay the unpaid prize 
awards of last year’s Carnegie 
song contest.

TAU BETA PI AND 
FACULTY TO MEET
Plans for a forum to discuss' the 
Engineering Curriculum at Carnegie 
were formulated, at-^the regular Tau 
Beta Pi meeting in the Commercial 
clubroom last Thursday evening.
The forum is to meet Thursday, 
February 25, at 7 p. m. in the 
smoking room of Thistle Hall. In 
addition to the Tau Beta Pi mem­
bers, two representatives from the 
faculty of each department of the 
Engineering College will be invited 
to attend, as well as representatives 
from the History, Economics, : Lan­
guage, Psychology and English De­
partments. Invitations will also be 
sent to Dr. Baker, Dr. Ihrig and Di­
rector Mott.
At this ¦ forjun it is planned to 
have an informal discussion of the 
Engineering Curriculum, the grading 
system at Carnegie, the feasibility of 
a five or six-year course in engineer­
ing.
At the same meeting last Thursday 
papers were read by Julius Ilalpern 
and William Burns. The subject of 
Halpcrn’s paper \Vas “Miissolini as a 
Journalist.” In his paper, Iialpern 
brought out many humorous incidents 
of Mussolini’s life before Mussolini 
became dictator. Burns’ paper was 
entitled “Wagner’s Operas.” In it 
Wagner’s works, with respect to style, 
purpose, etc., were discussed.
Ten Fraternities 
Pledge 26 New 
Men Since Dec. 15
Since the last compilation of so­
cial fraternity pledges, which was 
published in the December 15 issue 
of the Tartan, twenty-six .more men 
have been pledged to the various 
fraternities. The original- compila­
tion contained 175 names. ' This 
year -the number of post-season 
pledges is higher than, it has been 
for . several years, since' many of 
the rushecs waited until after the 
Christmas holidays to make their 
decision.
Kappa Delta Rho failed to re­
port a list of pledges to the Tar­
tan in time for publication with 
the first list in December. The- 
complete list for this fraternity is 
therefore included in the list below.
Despite this additional list of 
fraternity pledges, this year’s total 
number is somewhat below that of 
last year. The chief reason,. ac­
cording, to various fraternity mem­
bers, is the lack of financial means 
by many freshmen.
The following is a list of those 
men who have pledged to a social 
fraternity since December 13, 1931:

STUDENTS NEED 
FINANCIAL STUDY
W. Burke Harmon, president of 
the Harmon Foundation, an organ­
ization that advances loans to col­
lege students, declares that students 
need a knowledge of finance. The 
number of students who fail, after 
graduation, to repay college' loans 
indicates a lack of training in the 
financial situations of business or professional affairs.
About 17 per cent of the loans 
advanced by the corporation have 
never been repaid in accordance 
with the contract. Mr. Harmon at­
tributes these failures of prompt 
repayment to "the lack of training 
in personal finance” and “the lack 
of aggressive counselling on the 
part of the collcgc in personality 
matters and employment contact­ing.”
The results of the experimental 
work'in student loans points to the 
desirability of placing the student 
counselling department in the major

COMMITTEES APPOINTED
Benefit Performance to Be 
Given At Carnegie 
Music Hall
Angna Enters, a famous dancer 
and mimist, will appear for the 
first time in Pittsburgh at the an­
nual benefit of the Women’s' Schol­
arship Organization to be held at 
the Carnegie Music Hall on Mon­
day evening, February 29.
Because of her unusual and very 
fascinating compositions, Miss En­
ters has been very, successfully re­
ceived in Paris and London. In 
these compositions, she grasps a 
certain motive or mood and por­
trays it with exceptional sugges- 
tivcness and unity of design.” 
Louis Untcrmcycr, a modern critic, 
says, “She is an arresting and 
astonishing phenomenon—she fur­
nishes one of the most imaginative 
experiences in the theater today.”
Angna Enters not only orig­
inates her own dances but also 
designs and executes her costumes, 
which add greatly to the effective­
ness of her presentations. The 
New York Sun says “Her enter­
tainment is something which can­
not be described; it should be 
seen.” Miss Enters is better known 
on the European stage and on the 
Eastern coast than in Pittsburgh, 
but her first visit to this city 
should be very much anticipated by all thcatcr-goers.-'
Although definite dates' for the 
sale of tickets have not been an­
nounced the Campus sale will be­
gin shortly after the opening of 
the second semester. The pric&of 
the tickets will range from $2.50 
for orchestra scats to 50 cents for balcony seats.
The Women's Scholarship Or­
ganization is composed of one rep­
resentative from every activity oil 
the campus in which women par­
ticipate. Through its efforts, 
scholarships are awarded every 
year to deserving candidates in 
Margaret Morrison and Arts school 
In order to make this possible, the 
organization gives a theatrical 
benefit, every year, the proceeds 
of which arc used for this benefit.
Ruth Brooks, president of the 
Women’s Scholarishp Organization, 
has appointed the following com­
mittees to take charge: Advcrtis-

CHARTER OF OPEN 
FORUM IS LIFTED
At their meeting of January 19 
Student Council revoked the consti­
tution of the Carnegie Tech Open 
Fortim Club. The reason for ’this 
action was that the club had violated 
their constitution by holding a debate 
off-campus at which admission fees 
were paid. According to their agree­
ment with Student Council they were 
neither permitted to sponsor an off- 
campus meeting no to charge admis­
sion for it without first getting per­
mission from the Executive Board 
and Student Council. The club did 
not seek permission either for hold­
ing the debate or for posting placards 
on the official bulletin boards adver­tising it.
The council approved the petition 
of Phi Mu Alpha, men’s musical 
honorary, to use Thistle Hall for a 
tea dancc on Wednesday, January 27, 
from 4 to 6 o’clock.
ISSUE REPORT ON 
COAL ASSEMBLY
About February 1, the proceed­
ings of the Third International 
Bituminous Coal Conference will 
be published for general ,distribu- 
tion. They will be in two vol­
umes of 1,000 pages each and illus­
trated by diagrams and half-tones. 
They will include all the papers 
presented and a complete record 
of the discussions had at the Con­
ference.
In the January Review of Re­
views arc two articles dealing with 
coal and the Coal Conference. Is 
it true that machines throw men 
out of work? In “Man and the 
Machine,” Mr. Myron C. Taylor, 
head of the Financc Committee of 
the United States Steel Corpora­
tion, contends that they do not. 
lie first presented his argument 
at the Coal Conference.
“The Public Stake in Coal,” by 
Edward M. Barrow sums up the 
work done by the Coal Conference 
this year and shows the present 
position of the coal industry.

HIS MEETING WITH DUQUESNE next 
Saturday evening has every promise of being 
the high spot of intercollegiate basketball in 
Pittsburgh for this year. The Bluffers will en­
ter thie fray with some justified favoritism for 
placing the clinching touches to the city cham­
pionship. Their desire to win will be further 
magnified with the thought of gaining the initial 
decision over Carnegie in basketball.
With Jagnow and Smith back in running

the soup which must be re-strained anyhow in the return games 
between the three schools.* * * *
- THE CLOSING QUOTATIONS on Carnegie’s preferred
basketball stock of last week were given on a fifty-fifty basis, 
making a total margin of eight victories out of thirteen starts.
With a large side of a 33 to 22 score, the Panthers climbed 
from the depths of despair to the capable defenders of the city 
basketball championship. Louis Jagnow's absence from the line­
up was quite evident, and it is a wonder that a greater differ­
ence of score did not result.* * * *
IN THEIR RETURN MATCH AT WEST VIRGINIA
the Tartan boxers vindicated their reputation of a mediocre team 
which is rapidly advancing to that point where their opponents 
must consider them as a serious threat. The results were the 
same as of the previous match except in the 115-pound class 
where “Giant Killer” Wertz drew a bye, due to the inability of 
his opponent to reduce to the required weight limit. This al­
leged 115-pound Mountaineer must have gained about eight 
pounds during the week or else weighed in with a flock of bal­
loons prior to his bout in the Skibo gym two weeks ago.
The honors of the evening easily went to-Jeff Burke, sopho­
more satellite, for outboxing his golden-glovc opponent, Bob 
Latham. This bout possessed everything in the way of clever­
ness, class, and fine sportmanship. Each boxer, respecting his 
mate’s ability with the gloves, weaved about in a cautious man­
ner for the first two rounds. In the third frame leather began 
to fly, and before the final gong Burke was awarded a technical 
knockout. In his collegiate career Latham has been defeated in 
only two fights, the Tartan 155-pounder being the winner of 
both.Johnny Carr repeated his win over Hamilton, the southern 
southpaw, with a larger margin. Carr’s, manipulation of the 
gloves is improving with each appearance, and his remaining 
bouts should bring some more worthwhile scalps under his belt.
Jack Croissant, boxing for Waldron, who was slightly under 
the weather, met his weight in boxing-gloves from Hawkins, 
West Virginia captain. The Mountaineer won an uphill battle 
in the third round, after having ,spcnt a hectic few minutes in 
the first frarrje that did him no good.>|< * * 1

from 19^1 t6 192<l, when increasing 
deafness compelled him to give up 
teaching. He then became head 
of the Student Welfare Committee,
ThdV fund of which this commit­
tee has charge, established- in De­
cember, 1925,. by the gift of Pro­
fessor Wurts, provides help 
emergencies for needy students 
who may oy may not return the 
money when they are able. This 
committee also took charge of the 
Parents’ Day,' which is held ir 
connection with the annual, exhibi­
tion, had drinking fountains install­
ed on the campus and had Car­
negie Inn equipped with hat racks.
Professor Wurts for several 
years sponsored Thanksgiving and 
Christmas dinners for those stu­
dent who were unable to return to 
their homes for these occasions. In 
1927 he established a fund for this 
purpose which has been used regu 
larly since.
He was a member of the Ameri­

Society, and the Church of the 
Ascension.
In 1890 he mhrricd Miss’ Jeanie 
L. Childs, who died in 1924. In 1927 
he married Miss Elizabeth Reed 
Wurts, of East Orange; N. J., who 
survives him. He is also survived 
by two children, Thomas Childs 
Wurts of Pittsburgh, and Mrs. 
Douglas Chandler of France.
The funeral was held Saturday,

DUKES CONTINUE 
FIGHT FOR CITY 
TITLE SATURDAY
Pitt Wins First Contest,
Western Reserve 
Defeated
That hard working Tartan basket­
ball team gets a much needed, rest 
this week in'preparation for the Du­
qucsnc game in the-" Tech gym 011 
Saturday night. After the game last 
night with the strong Geneva five 
the squad appeared to be quite tired 
and arc thankful for the four days 
rest before their next encounter.
In order to remain in the running 
for the city championship, the Skibos 
must "take" this fast going Du- 
quesne team. The Dukes have a re­
markable record this year, having 
sustained only one defeat and that 
was the last of a four game series 
in four ' days. Duqucsnc has defeat­
ed two teams which have succeeded 
conquering Carnegie, namely; 
Grove City and Pitt. In' defeating 
Grove City in the first game they 
showed that the pre-season dope 
about the "Bluffitcs” was correct, 
but in trouncing Pitt they showed 
tile experts that they had a smooth 
working combination which is as 
strong as any in this district. Their 
margin of victory over Grove City 
was one point and over Pitt seven 
points. The Dukes have also de­
feated Bucknell, Georgetown, Cath­
olic U, and several teams in this 
district.
Because of Carnegie’s defeat at the 
hands of Pitt, the Tartans will be. 
the underdog in this game. It is 
from this position that we like to 
see the Plaid outfit enter the con­
test. We know how in the past, 
Carnegie, as the underdog, has come 
out and surprised its opponents, and 
we have the feeling that that is just 
what is going to happen Saturday. 
Jimmy Leonard and his teammates 
have played some fine basketball this 
winter and one poor game -does not 
break a team. On the contrary we 
arc glad that it is out of their 
system.
Pitt Pulls Surprise
Last Wednesday night the, Tartans 
lonce more' succumcd to the attack 
of the Pitt Panther. The jinx which 
Pitt has held over Carnegie did not 
desert them this year, 011 the con-' 
trary it seemed stronger than ever. 
Carnegie , entered ¦ the . game as thp 
favorite, blit-the game had not pro­
gressed far until it was evident that 
the Skibos were off, and that the 
Panthers were on.- Doc Carlson who 
before the game bemoaned the fact 
that lie did not have any center to 
use, pulled a„Rocknc trick by,send­
ing, into the game an unheard • of, 
center who far surpassed the playing 
of his varsity men.
This center seemed to be just what 
Pitt needed. The Panthers without 
a doubt played their best/game. of 
the year. Certainly they were al­
most unbeatable. So close was their 
guarding that the Tartan players 
found it difficult to even get a shot 
at the basket. At the end of the 
half the Panthers had rolled tip' a 
load of 26-6, The second half was 
not as bad ¿is the first but tlie 
Skibos could not begin to cut down 
the advantage. In the second, half 
Carnegie held Pitt to seven points 
while they were scoring sixteen bring­
ing the final score at 32-22 in favor 
of the Panther.
Subs Lead Red Cats
The Tartans showed that one de­
feat was not enough to break their 
morale by, trimming the Western Re­
serve basketball team by the score 
of 33-22 011 Friday night. Coach 
Iiogan decided to try out his second 
team against the visitors. He started 
them, and so well did they go that 
they, played .all but a minute of. the 
first half. At half tiimc the score 
was 12-9 in favor of Carnegie. In 
the second half the first team > ran 
up a commanding lead and then were 
content to take it easy for the re­
mainder of the half.
Boxers Lose Close 
Match To W. Va. 
Carr, Burke Star
Improved Carnegie Team 
Looses Thriller By 
3-4 Score
Freshmen T ankers 
Lose to High 
Schools
The freshman swimming team lost 
their first meet of the season last 
Wednesday, by the score of 36 to 
32; A stroi]g Taylor Allderdice High 
School team was the victor and the 
thrilling meet was not decided until 
the last event was over. Both teams 
were evenly matched, Tech taking 
three first and Allderdice four.
The plcbcs took the lead by win­
ning the relay, but Alldcrdicc came 
right back and held Tech to a third 
in t|ie diving. King and Kelly placed 
first and second for Tech in the 
50-yard free style, but again the 
high schoolers offset this lead by 
taking the first two places in the 
breaststroke. The meet scc-sawcd
back and forth till Alldcrdicc won the 
last event, the medley relay, and 
thereby won the meet. The remaining 
Plaid points came largely through
James’ first in the 220 and Bray’s 
victory in the backstroke,
Saturday the Plcbcs lost another 
thriller, this time to South Hills
High School, by the score of 38-30. 
Again the freshmen took the lead by 
winning the 200-yard relay, only to 
{'clinquish it after the breaststroke
event. Kelly easily won the 50, be­
ing followed .by King, also of Car­
negie. The backstroke went to Bray, 
though he was closely pressed by two
A greatly improved Tartan box­
ing team fought the powerful West 
Virginia aggregation almost to a 
standstill last Saturday, finally los­
ing by a. 3 t,o 4 scorc. The match 
was easily the most furious and 
exciting staged in Morgantown for 
some time, and goes far toward 
establishing' Coach Ernie Sesto and 
his gloved athletes as a permanent 
Carnegie fixture.
Jeff Burke and Bob Latham 
staged a bout that was much above 
the average type of intercollegiate 
boxing, the Skibo star, Burke, win­
ning by a technical knockout in 
the third round. Latham is a box­
er of no mean ability, and so far 
lie has accepted defeat from no 
one but Coach Sesto’s right hand 
man. The two fighters used the 
first two rounds in cautiously test­
ing each other, and looking for 
openings that did not occur. How­
ever, the final frame quickly devel­
oped into a whirlwind of action 
until a staggering right to Lath­
am’s mid-section ended the bout.
The first bout went to Wertz 
on a forfeit, as Morrison, West 
Virginia flyweight, could not get 
down to the desired 119 pounds. 
Last week Morrison took a terrific 
beating from Tech’s mighty atom, 
although the former -won, and 
when Saturday’s bout was called' 
off, the crowd was robbed of a 
great exhibition.
The next two bout's (went to 
West Virginia, Fisher gaining a 
technical knockout over Atlas, 
while Neely 'had too much stuff for 
Hcllegers and this fight was also 
stopped at the end of two rounds.
Carnegie came right' back and 
tied the. score at 2-all, this time 
as a result of Carr’s victory over 
Hamilton. Carr is one of the fast­
est-improving men on the Skibo 
squad.and his defeat of Hamilton, 
Saturday, was ‘‘concrete" proof of 
his newly acquired ability. The 
fight itself was one of those fast- 
moving, 1 slam-bang affairs with Carr 
leading for the whole three rounds 
and holding a wide advantage at 
the finish.
As Carnegie has no middleweight 
they were forced to forfeit this 
¡division to West Virginia. This 
brought the match up to the last 
boiit with the score at 3-3. The 
gladiators, for this, fight were Haw-; 
klflsj Mounta.inccr captain and star, 
and ... Croissant, reformed Tartan 
heavj'. The fight started off with 
a fury that eclipsed all previous 
ones, the participants being more 
eager to give than to receive. s
In': tho terrific pace that was set 
in that first round, each man floor-1 
cd his, opponent and often the 
lighters stood toe to toe and ex­
changed heavy blows. As the sec­
ond''round opened, Hawkins, beat 
Jack to a punch over the heart and 
frbrii then 011 until the fight was 
stopped, the West Vi,rginian , had 
the edge. This last, bout was so 
exciting'and important to the final 
outcomc, that the wild-eyed crowd 
payed little attention to those rules 
concerning silence during the fight­
ing.

Firsts
Hooks A n d J a b s
Last Saturday, the highly touted 
Carnegie swimming team opened its 
season with an' easy 54-10 victory 
over Wobstcr College. The Tartans 
have a strong, well-balanced tcaiA and 
did not allow their opponents a 
single first place. Wooster’s scoring 
was confined mostly to third placcs 
and they found it hard to. take even 
a sccond.
'Pal” Miller was the high scorer 
of the meet, taking first in the 50 
and 100 yard free styles, and swim­
ming anchor man. on the victorious 
200 yard relay team. La Chance fol­
lowed Miller in the 100 for Tech, 
while Frankc was the sccond Car-' 
negic man in the 50.
Ranny Boyer, swimming in his 
first meet of varsity competition, set 
a new pool record of 1:08 for the 
100 yard backstroke. Cadmus swam 
very nicely into second place 'for 
Tech.
Ted Eastabrookc executed some 
beautiful dives in winning the fancy 
diving event while Wally Deredync 
and Capt. Bill Edwards walked, or 
rather, swam off with the first two 
places in the 220.
The varsity is idle until after 
exams,, there next meet coming “011

SERIOUSLY SPEAKING
(Continupd from Page One) 
tion may be millcnial, for all we 
know.
After all, all of these .words, 
phrases and watchwords have a 
definite historical and cultural back­
ground which is ours for the 
knowing. They also have an 
etymology which it would be well 
for u$ to become acquainted with 
at once. What a feeling of relief 
and pleasure will come to him who 
gets to know just how these fear­
some words came into popular 
speech! Enlightenment would bring 
surcease of care and worry to 
many who witness the ‘‘decline of 
morals," who notice with concern 
the antics and foibles "of our 
times." Nor is all this meant to 
be merely cynical or disparaging. 
TliC'Contention is simply that when 
we become familiar with the facts 
behind these words \vc may be 
able to reincorporate them with 
new meaning and spirit to serve 
our own needs rather than those 
of an ancicht past.
We can dust off these old saws 
and become idealists again.
South Hills men. The school boys 
won both the 100 and 220 but Tech 
managed to get a sccond in both 
events. The medley relay went to 
South Hills, although they' had al­
ready cinched the meet and did, not 
need these points.
Freshmen Basketball 
Team Preps For 
Duquesne
Following last night’s scrimmage, 
the Tartan yearlings went intc) se­
clusion for, the rest of the week to 
get set for Saturday’s game with the 
Duke freshmen. It will be about the 
longest rest period the boj's have had 
between two games, for they arc 
playing a heavy schedule. The Du- 
qucsne lads, have played through 
twenty-seven games in the last two 
years without a defeat. It would be 
a pretty feather in the Skibo’s hat 
to set tlie Dukes, on their twenty- 
eighth attempt. The latest victory 
for the Duke five was against the 
Pitt freshmen.
These Pitt boys, by the way, were 
just a quantum too" much for i the 
•Plaid yearlings, for they were able 
to give the Plebes their first defeat 
of the season. The game was a 
good one and belonged to either side 
until the last gun. If it had not been 
for a fair-haired boy by the name 
of Wilson, who dropped in three 
buckcts in a row for the little 
Panthers, the game might Have end­
ed more favorabfy. In the last two 
minutes the score was run up from a 
22 tie to a 28-22 victory for the 
Cubs.
Coach N.ease gave his first string­
ers a real Avorjtout. There wasn’t a 
single substitution in the whole game. 
Carlson and Beres played forwards, 
Mihm and Riggs guards, and Ewalt 
center. Carlson and Ewalt led the 
scorers with six points each.

On Wednesday afternoon at 4:30 
in the Trophy Room, there will be 
a meeting , for all those interested in 
playing ice hockey. During the past 
several years a number of meetings 
of this sort have been held, but no 
definite decision has been reached
due to the inability to make satis­
factory arrangements for practice
sessions.
Anyone, who is an experienced 
skater is urged io report, for a good 
skater can easily develop into a
player. Should enough candidates 
report to make it possible to form 
a team, then serious thought will be 
given to next year's plans.
It is possible tliat satisfactory ar­
rangements might be made with the 
new management of Duqucsnc Gar­
dens so that, should "enough inter­
est be shown, this sport could. be
developed into recognition. The popu­
larity of amateur hockey in Pitts­
burgh has already been shown, a 
successful league having operated 
here in 1929.
Carnegie's entry in this league was 
forced to withdraw before the sea­
son started due to the severe in­
fluenza epidemic which caused school 
to be suspended for several weeks.
In the early days of Carnegie, 
hockey was one of the school’s big­
gest sports. The first team was cap­
tained by “Buddy’’ Overcnd who 
coached the team several years later.
A hockey team consists of six 
players, but a squad of fifteen cap­
able performers is necessary because 
the extremely fast -pace at which the 
game is .played necessitates many 
substitutions.. The; season,', runs from 
October to March. Many of the 
Eastern, colleges support hockey. 
There are good teams at Yale, Cor­
nell, Syracuse, Michigan, Harvard, 
Army, PQiin and Dartmouth.

slowlj' revoke back to their original 
owners, and that a larger quantity 
never do, the total number of pos­
sessions that are lost in a year on 
the campus is tremendous. Whether 
the cause of this collegiate forgetful­
ness is an inefficient psychology 
course, too intimate association on 
the part of students with their absent- 
minded professors, or heads too thor­
oughly saturated with math formulae 
to remember anything1 else, it is dif­
ficult to saj\
Even with the staggering quantities 
of personal effects that must be lost 
within a year, no case has been re­
ported quite as prickling to the imagi­
nation as that of a downtown theater 
(Charles A. Danver for verification) 
where a janitor, after the final show 
had ended, found under the seats a 
lonely pair of trousers. Nevertheless, 
after' glancing at the above" list, can 
it not be conjectured that the 
converse of this incident might occur 
at Carnegie? At almost any time a 
student could walk into the cafeterias 
and the claiming office of the cam­
pus garbed in only a barrel, and by 
proper selection from misplaced be­
longings be able to salvage a com­
plete set- of clothing, gloves, hat, scarf, 
coat, and all!. .'

TUESDAY, JANUARY 26, 1932.THE CARNEGIE TARTANPAGE THREE.
A SECTION OF THE TARTAN DEVOTED TO THE NIGHT STUDENTS.Uhc Carnegie flMaiò
NIGHT ART’S DANCE THISTLE HAUL FEBRUARY 6, 1932
The Scotch instinct is showing 
itself in a very marked degree if 
we can take the . -writing of the 
athletic department seriously, and 
I suppose we can, in this instance. 
It is remarkable how young one 
can be when it comes to getting 
reduced admittance rates to the 
athletic contests on the campus. 
Some people seem to take delight 
in passing as college students, even 
misrepresenting themselves as night 
students, and try to sally past the 
“gate” in order to save a few 
cents. Student athletic books arc 
intended for the students only .and 
the transferring of these books 
certainly :is a breach of agreement. 
The athletic department seems to 
be all up in arms over the situa­
tion . and the alumni come in for 
some of the blame.
* * * * *
Tradition—well, I suppose tradi­
tion should appeal to the alumni 
to support the various teams and 
attend the contests, but while they 
are doing so, they should pay 
their way and help along. It can 
be seen plainly that some of the 
alumni are seeking to get into the 
games at a rebate—by use of the 
student athletic books—but there is 
no sportsmanship in this practice. 
It’s an injustice to everyone con­
cerned. So let’s see if we can’t 
get rid of this unpleasant situation 
by everyone doing his bit, that is, 
paying his way in his respective 
group.*****
Parking—parking—parking—no end 
of parking. Where is it going to 
stop? We arc certainly getting 
some prominence when they go as 
far away as that suburbanite inti­
mated in the complaint aired a few 
weeks ago. I am glad to note that 
someone took up all the points and 
¡gave such a complete explanation 
on the various phases of the park­
ing situation at Carnegie Tech. 
Some of the points brought out 
."by the disgruntled individual were 
¦ad riddled that they would hardly 
¡hold water let alone hold air. It 
would be a nice state of affairs 
Si all the night students would 
pass out of the picture so that the 
patrons of the Little Theater could 
park their cars when and where 
they plchiscd. Perhaps there would 
be no ' night performances if we 
did go. , You sec, they run the 
lights for the night students, and 
if they didn’t have the power on, 
well, there would be no lights for 
the *shows. We’re not selfish, but 
we surely arc entitled to a little 
spot in the sun even if it is arti­
ficial,*****
Yes,' they’re here — EXAMS — 
and how. It surely is a hot time 
in old Tech’ this week. All set 
againEt you and nowhere to go. 
Every night this week will find us 
trying to put down on paper all 
that we know and some. If I had 
my way, but I don’t, I'd try to 
find out how little the Prof. knew 
and then quiz him along these 
lines. Of course, I would be pre­
pared to show my superiority by 
knowing every phase of the ques­
tion, and when it came to a place 
where the examiner failed, I’d put 
down two “R’s" just by way of 
emphasis. It’s a great world if 
3rou don’t weaken, but many a night 
student has weakened under the 
strains of the exam period. We 
should have a moratorium or some 
such thing like they passed out to 
Europe and this period should last indefinitely.
Thursday Last Day 
of Marathon Contest
Committee Hard At Work 
Tabulating Great Number 
of Entries
With just two more days left be­
fore the closing date, January 2S, 
interest in the marathon champion­
ship mounts higher and higher. Al­
though the response to this unique 
contest has been greater than the 
committee had anticipated they hasten 
to add that the contest is still very 
much of a race and a dark horse 
may yet upset the dope.
One of the entries received is so 
interesting -that we are publishing 
it here. Although we suspect that 
the writer deliberately choose this 
method of presenting his entry the 
letter is so humorous that we pass 
it on to you.
Grccnsburg, Pa. 
Dear Mr. Nuse Editor:
I heer yousc guys wicli ar runnin 
things at Carnegie Tech ar startin a 
contest to see wich one of the stu­
dents is the most ambishus, or comes 
the most miles, or has the most
monic, or somthin like that.
Wei I talked to some of the fcl- 
los in there one nitc an told them 
that I come frum away out behind 
Red onion, wcl some budy musta 
gota holda that becus I seen that 
they hav me spoted in the Plaid
(you no the page that has all about 
the nitc studens) as comin frum Red 
onion an 1 jus wanta tell you I 
dont liy in Red onion.
Now that they hav me spoted I 
gcss 111 belong to there old con­
test, becus I always wanted to hav 
my name in the paper. You no wat 
I think wood be nisc, to hav the 
pichcr of the winner in the paper.
Wcl here’s wishin I win the contest.
Yours truley,
Ambishus.
P.S.—I travlc abot 200 miles a 
weak and think that takes a lot of
ambishun.
The committee is now hard at 
work tabulating the many entries 
received and next week will publish 
a list of the longest distance travelers 
as well as declare the winners of 
the contest. In this conncction the 
committee wishes to point out that 
two winners will be chosen, a cham­
pion long distance traveler having the 
greatest weekly milage and one hav­
ing the greatest total milage per 
evening.
If you have not already gent in 
your entry do so at once. Just ad­
dress your letter to the News Editor 
of the Plaid stating the number of 
miles traveled each evening and the 
total traveled per week together with 
the number of evenings spent on the 
Campus.

Art Comment
Recently we have read in the read­
ers column of a local newspaper, a 
letter by one who belittles the art 
of the Old Masters, dismissing them 
as merely recorders of life and not 
interpreters. He claims that our 
modern artists such as Picasso, 
Matisse, and Dufy have developed a 
form of art far superior to that 
of the old masters, bccause through 
the enjoyment of their art one can 
derive csthctical pleasure, and that 
if we wish to make progress in art, 
then we must depart from reality and traditional forms.
Incidently, with the publication of 
this letter . the Byers Collection of 
Old Masters was placed 011 exhibi­
tion at the Carnegie 'Galleries, there 
to thrill and fascinate those of us 
art lovers who have become dis­
gusted with the highly "superior” 
materialistic forms of modern ex­pression in painting.
After viewing this fascinating col­
lection you will probably lament the 
fact, that we have so few such recorders of life today.
Would you rather derive csthcti­
cal pleasure through the medium of 
Picassos "1 he Window" which was 
on exhibition at the recent Art In­
ternational, or breathe the fragrant 
air and feel the mystic charm of a 
Corot landscape that 110 camera can record ?
Our critic claims that the greater 
the artistic interpretations the less 
realistic the object becomes. If he 
will study the works of Corot, 
Daubigny, and Bonheur, he will not 
find anything realistic in them, be­
cause by a few magic strokes of 
the brush that feeling of realism is 
changed and one is carricd off into 
a world not. of fact but fancy, and, 
realism does not cxirt in fancy.
One marvels at the rich, expres­
sive colors, exquisite detail, and pig­
mentation, qualities that our modern­
ists consider meaningless and em­
bryonic. Consider the fine portraits 
by Rdmney, Gainsborough and 
Rubens, in which one can feel • the 
very soul of the subject, and then 
compare with Picasso's prize-winning 
portrait of his wife in which he 
strove only for mathematical pre­cision.
Having viewed this exhibition, one 
vill unconsciously take a last sweep­
ing glance at them before leaving the 
galleries, satisfied that lie has found 
the utmost in artistic diversion. E.
Hark ye night students of Car­
negie, do ye possess bulging mus­
cles, barrel chests and athletes’feet? 
No? Then ye may as well quit 
school and dig sewers in Siberia, 
because ye have no brains. Yes my 
fellow night students, that is the 
latest cdict of scicncc. The dcstitn 
of this world is in the hands of 
athletes.
A learned professor of neurology 
(whatever that is) has just con­
cluded, after twenty years of pains­
taking experimenting with rats, that 
football players, prizefighters and 
wrestlers have the most brains. What 
a blow to we humble night students 
who arc forccd to ncglcct our muscu­
lar development by day to eke out 
an existence with the sweat of our 
brow, and attempt to develop our 
intellectual faculties by night, 'only 
to have our ambitions blasted by the 
treacherous cdict that one must be 
a football player to have brains.
Oh to. be a football player; we 
could show them ,how to run seventy 
yards for a touchdown—just give us 
a chance. This is a crucl and heart­
less world; first we arc denounced 
as morons for whistling to keep up 
courage, and now we arc called itn- 
bccilcs.
The life of a night student is 
filled with remorse and hopeless 
effort. He attends school under the 
veil of darkness, learns his lessons 
by artificial light, and returns home 
to the hoot of an owl. Then he 
stays up till 3 a. m. preparing his 
next night's assignment, only to be 
denounced as a bookworm with a 
low intellect.
But wait, can you milk a cow? 
Then wipe away that tear of de­
spair for there is hope. Milk a 
cow once ‘every day and you will 
develop a brain capable of extracting 
the cube root ' of a nineteen digit 
figure. And who can tell you may 
even become one of the seven people 
who understand Einstein. Part of 
the above statement was made by 
no less an authority than the cube 
root king of Iowa.
The current rumor that "Suicide 
in Costume” is really a desperate 
night student who did the fatal thing 
when informed of this newest scien­
tific discovery is all rot. Surely no 
one would take it so seriously; just 
remember that Tesla, the great elec­
trical wizard, was. a hopeless de­
formed little man, and even Ein­
stein, the great promulgator of 
theories has long been suffering from 
physical weakness. Examples of 
brainy men in history who were 
physically inert arc as numerous as 
the sands of the desert.
The good professor of neurology 
will undoubtedly receive a niche in 
the hall of fame for his self-sacrifice 
and near martyrdom with rats, and 
his deductions may be preserved for­
ever in the arc archives of scicncc, 
but wc have a sneaking suspicion 
that night students, whose chances 
of becoming football players are re­
mote, will not be discouraged.

Professors arc made distinctive 
because of the codcs of ethics which 
they adhere to. A professional man 
usually stands out in a crowd be- 
fcause, if he has really taken the 
code of his profession seriously, lie 
has in a measure assimilated its 
principles to such an extent that lie 
thinks, acts and talks for the good 
of his profession and, of course,— 
for himself.
Since the rise of professions the 
idea'of professionalism has been at­
tacked from many sides. While many 
of its foes have been in some degree 
in the right in attacking it, yet there 
is little-doubt left that as a policy it 
has its advantages.
The disadvantages caused by the 
lack of professionalism is evident in 
engineering. No one today will deny 
that engineering is a profession. Few 
can hold that professionalism has 
more than touched it. Certain groups 
of engineers who have formed so­
cieties have formulated a code of 
ethics which seem to be entirely in­
adequate.
Can one say that the engineers 
have a strong, co-operative associa­
tion as say the doctors and lawyers? 
Can any otic look into the engineer­
ing profession and see an attitude 
not which attempts to lower the 
status of other professions or lines 
of endeavor, but rather to raise their 
own standards, to cause the public to 
look upon them as a group of men 
of intelligence, character and ability 
who arc trying to obtain the 
recognition which they so justly de­
serve?
The engineer of today must show 
the world that he too has a right to 
recognition and high standing. In­
dustry thinks little of the engineer 
bccause of his past standing. An 
engineer has a right to demand that 
his work rcccivc the proper reward. 
Industry must be taught that with­
out the engineer no further progress 
can be made. The prevalent practice 
of discharging engineers as soon as 
business falls off slightly is a -poor 
one. The only reason that this prac­
tice has continued is because the pro­
fession has been so slow to assert 
itself.
Now is the time for the profession
Pro fessionalism ¦THE COMING NIGHT 
ART'S COLLEGE DANCE
Unusual interest in the coming 
Arts Dance to be held at Thistle 
Hall, is becoming more apparent as 
time draws near for the affair and 
night arts students are impatiently 
awaiting the evening of February 6, 
when one of the most popular social 
affairs on the night campus is to 
be held.
Arts danccs of the.past have been 
very succcssful, so succcssful in fact, 
that it was at times necessary to 
guard against crashcrs, and the fact 
that Thistle Hall is to be used for 
all future Arts affairs, is enough 
assurance of their continued popular­
ity Thistle Hall is considered to be 
one of the finest halls in the city, 
and one that any school can well be 
proud of. It was built during the 
summer, but only recently opened 
to student activities.
All night students who- arc regis­
tered in the Night C-Mcge of Fine 
Arts, and who have paid their activi­
ties fee, with which these danccs arc 
financed, arc entitled to attend these 
affairs.
The social committee is now en­
gaged in «taking plans that will in­
clude the finest entertainment.
E.
to show that it too can stand 011. a 
par with other professions and that 
it expects the reward which has 
been so long withheld from it. The 
men who have elected engineering 
as a profession will, find more and 
more in this day of keen competition 
that not only must an engineer have 
command of his technical knowledge 
but that he must be able to cope 
with problems which arc not dircctly 
related to technical matters.
When lie is able to show that he 
has some backbone and is supported 
by an organization as solid as the 
steel which goes into the structures 
which lie designs and builds, then 
and then only will he be anything 
more than a mere servant to in­
dustry.
Ritzy Boxing?
In the last issue of the Tartan 
your correspondent noticed that the 
opening of the boxing season at Car- 
ncgiic would take place with the 
audience attired in formal dress, pro­
vided they followed the wishes of the 
athletic committee. As I am not a 
pacifist, and always ready for a g<4od 
fight, I hastened to the scene of 
this mixing of soup and fish with 
blood • and perspiration. Not wishing 
to disturb the moths that , were liv­
ing so happily in my dress suit, now 
you tell one, I attended, as did 
many others, in everyday working 
clothes and seated myself at a point 
of vantage to watch this outpour­
ing of the elite.
Well sir, they catnc, I was, and 
then went home greatly puzzled. 
After the bouts started and one of 
the gladiators showed decided 
splotches of red, what did the elite 
do—well they did just what the 
blcachcritcs did, yelled for more 
gore, for murder, and for com­
plete annihilation of the common 
enemy.
Previous to the match I had been 
wondering if a stiff front and a 
wing collar would make a difference 
in man’s inbred liking for a good 
scrap. Would the gorgeously gowned 
girls shudder and faint? No, posi­
tively 110, thc3r were just as blood­
thirsty as their brothers and sisters 
perched up on the bleachers. But 
bravo my hearties, more power to 
you, we arc glad that, at least 
sartorialy, a brutal sport is being 
educated and raised to a higher plane, 
and if ever those moths decide to 
leave their present habitation you 
will have another addition to your 
ranks.

NIGHT DRAMA STUDENTS 
TO PRESENT PLAYS
On the nights of February 2, 3 
and 4 the students of the night 
drama department will present four 
one-act plays in the Little Theater. 
Once each semester the night drama 
department give these plays as a 
regular part of their studies. The 
plays to be given arc “The Dear. 
Departed,” “Woman’s Honor," “An 
Escape” and "Fritzchcn.” “An Escape” 
was written by otic of the students. 
These productions arc under the 
direction of Professor Hickman and 
bccause of the limited amount of 
time available, only a few perform­
ances can be given each year. Al­
most all of the night drama stu­
dents will take part in these pro­
ductions. In past years attendance at 
these plays has been small but a 
marked interest has been shown that 
speaks well for these productions. 
Tickets will be available at the 
Registrar’s office for those desiring 
to attend these performances.

Professor Wurts
The death of Professor A. J. Wurts has terminated a career 
which for a quarter of a century has aided in developing our 
school. Engaged as the first instructor at the opening of the 
original Carnegie Technical Schools, he served the institution in 
many ways. Advance to the position of head of a department, 
followed recently by retirement in order to prepare a history of 
the school and to continue the student welfare work, he organ­
ized, were high spots of the later years of his association here.
In the development of student welfare work, Professor 
Wurts rendered fine service, and his personal interest made for 
him many friends among the students and faculty. His death is 
a very definite loss to the school,1 and to his friends and all who 
knew him.
Are Our Rushing Rules Satisfactory?
The Interfraternity Council has appointed a group to in­
vestigate the rushing’rules at Carnegie and to decide whether 
a change is necessary or even desirable. ' • .
This action is no surprise,, nor is the present committee 
greeted with any more than the mild interest which preceding 
groups, originating put of the same past season murmerings of 
discontent, achieved when they undertook to reorganize our 
rushing.
This year t|ie shortened period for entertaining freshmen 
was a success only as a financial emergency. The faults of inten­
sified rushing were brought out most clearly in the season just 
passed. The time is now ripe for some change, and let it be 
really an all inclusive move this time, not merely another tem­
porary amendment. ,
As an aid to the committee chosen by the Council, the 
Tartan has undertaken a survey of rushing programs in effect at 
all the leading colleges in the country. It is hoped that by 
presenting these results soon some suggestions f<pr our own 
problem will be found. In addition an attempt is being made 
to solicit opinions and suggestions from within our fraternities.
Perhaps if the inherent complacency of the presiding groups 
be disturbed into action some solution will be forthcoming.* * * *
Recent development of microphotography have come to 
the aid of historians in devising a means of preserving a 
permanent record of newspapers and periodicals, these pub­
lications being classed as the, most important sources of 
historical material. A means' has been devised whereby
each page is photographed on a roll of film, and tl?e roll
filed till used for reference.* * * *
Dr. L. A. Pechstein, dean of the Teachers’ College at 
the University of Cincinnati, recently issued a statement 
calling for a means of protecting public school pupils from 
the uncurbed depredations of inexperienced instructors. He 
suggests precluding graduation from a teachers’ college until 
the candidate had served a year’s interneship in trying his 
skill, as is done in the medical schools.
C O N T R ï B S
-An Idea on Fraternity Rushing-
By a Carnegie Tech Graduate 
and Fraternity Man
A recent issue of thç^Tartan stated 
that the Interfraternity Council, in 
its search for the right answer to 
the present rushing problem, was 
open to suggestion and comment on 
the subject. The writer would like 
to present for consideration a plan 
which, though not generally discussed 
because of a lack of urgency at the 
time, a few years ago was .brought 
forth as a possible answer to the 
problem of fraternity rushing and 
pledging as it exists at Carnegie 
Tech. It might be added that at 
the time this proposal received the 
unqualified approval of the Admin­
istration.
Deferred Rushing Approved 
Briefly,v the problem appears to re­
solve itself into two parts. The Ad­
ministration disapproves of freshmen 
becoming affiliated with fraternities 
before they have had the opportunity 
to find themselves and to prove 
themselves in as Carnegie students. 
Oh the other hand, the fraternities 
are faced with the problem of select­
ing and pledging a new group of 
men with as much wisdom and as 
little delay as possible after the lift­
ing of the restrictions desired by the 
Administration.
Substitute Deferred Pledging
The suggested answer is this: 
Eliminate the present intensive rush­
ing season entirely, and substitute a 
deferred pledging date. This can 
readily be accomplished by permitting 
unrestricted social intercourse from 
the opening of school until the time 
for the pledging, which may be at 
any time agreed upon.
Someone immediately raises the 
question. “But we’ve just cut down 
our rushing period from two weeks 
to one, in > an attempt to curtail ex­
penses. You want to extend it to 
several, months. You would have 
every House on the oampus 'bank­
rupt.” I hardly think so! There isn’t 
a fraternity in existence that could 
carry on a high-priced two-month 
rushing program, and. tliprc would 
be nothing to gain by anything but a 
normal social program such as would 
be representative of each fraternity’s 
social inclinations. Instead of high- 
priced novelties attended by large 
groups of rushees, in which there is 
little enough opportunity for either 
party to present their propositions, 
occasional smokers, dinners, lunches, 
house dances, etc. would offer an 
ideal time to entertain a few new 
men at a time.
No Need For Hurry
Why oil this excitement over a
FROM THE FENCE
A. Friend Passes On—
With the passing of Prof. Wurts goes the first appointed faculty member of Carnegie Tech and one of the finest of men. Unfortunately students in Carnegie for the last ten years have had little opportunity to know Prof.. Wurts because he -wprked in an unasuming manner, but nevertheless doing fine things. He obtained his scientific train­ing at Yale where he was a varsity football man. His electrical training was acquired at Stevens In­stitute of Technology. In connection with his elec­trical res earch 
work Prof. Wurts develop­ed the first prac­tical 1 i g h tning arrestor and did considerable to­ward develop­ing a non arc­ing metal. Inhis early daysat Carnegie he rode one of the first motorized vehicles in the vicinity, a motorcycle. Every­thing that Prof. Wurts did was methodically planned beforehand so that there would be a mini­mum waste of time and effort. After his death it was learned that he had even prepared an obit­uary notice for the newspapers. A more uniformly courteous and kindly gentleman would be hard to 
find. He was always tremendously interested in the students and their welfare. A number of anonymous gifts to needy students were from Prof.Wurts. There was a life anyone can do well toremember. . . .* * * *
Ray, Co-Eds!—
After the usual feminine tardiness the Co-ed' Puppet came forth displaying material of a quality somewhat above Puppet average. The girls ex­plain their tardiness with the excuse that they were ready 'way before tiipe but Collins, desiring to stay in school another semester, censored most of their' material and the poor girls had to go to work again and think up some tame'Stuff. They should publish the suppressed material under the name of Ballj'whooy and make millions . . . Edna Pearson’s “Obey That Impulse” sketch takes the cake . . . The "fond mother—sandman—modern child” gag gets the 'Bronx hurrah for its age, and put in as original to boot. .When is the Horning Memorial to be presented? . . . After glancing thru the Puppet we learn that there are sororities in the Art Sclidol. Who would have -thot it? . . . Why not some more cartoons from Betty Phillips? * * * *
Scraps—
We hear that the Night Student Council threw a very nice dance in the Gym Saturday nite. Far too big a crowd for Thistle Hall. The chief dif­ficulty was the none too smooth floor. A handful of day students there. Mary McKeon and Helen Willetts, with their partners sought diversionment in a game of bridge on the bleachers. .. . .' The . tall handsome instructor that causes frequent fluttering in the Laurel girls’ hearts is Mr. Kohl. Sorry, but there isn’t a chance girls. . . . One of the instruc­tors very seriously warned the Freshwomen never to sing "All of Me” because it is an immoral song. . . . Last Saturday a tall- Nawth Car’lina boy, working his way thru college selling maga­zines, called on the inmates of the girls’ dorms. He . was entertained with bridge at Birch and radio, mu­sic at Mellon. . Have you heard the “bootleg” radio, station wheezing on a wave a little below that of KDKA’s? And the Western Penitentiary Dance Band over the radio? . . . The little presi­dent of Beta Tau Lambda wishes to announce that unfortunately the rumor published in the Pup­pet is not correct. . . . A certain senior manager has been boasting that he elected the frosh basket­ball captain in the recent election. His indiscretion belies his senior ranking. . . .* * * *
Black Cats—
“Buzz” Kountz can add another feather to his
cap after Friday nite’s affair. Though the .crowd was one of the smallest of the year the music was' equal to the best. These basketball dances arc quite all right. One of the most notable features of the evening was the great number' of well known couples who. were there, but with different partners —leap year must have brought about quite a few splits. It certainly is nice , to see that so many more of the faculty are joining in the dancing. Among those we noticed were Messrs. Daniels, Pugh, Fryer and as usual Mr. Davis with his big smile. We certainly do like to see Coach Rise- dorpli around again as we surely did miss him. One other, Doc Neelley, sort of fell, down on Us though. Perhaps Doc didn’t show up ’cause be knew those naughty Sigma Nu’s would start that awful stomp again. Wish they would keep it on the other side of Forbes street. (Editor’s note— We’ve got the Birch Hall Hop on this side of Forbes street. That’s enough! . . .)* * * *
To the Dorm Men—
In reply to Contrib letter. We tried to point out that the poor reputation that the dorms occasion­ally get is due to an irresponsible few but reflects on the group. Admitted that the majority of the dorm men are NOT morons as we heard quoted but suffer under the pranks of a few very thought­less men. In every previous instance nve have heartily backed the dorm men but felt it only fair to attempt to show another side for a change. In , several instances trouble, came from no fault of the dorm men but we believe that a reasonable tightening of the discipline there would prevent trouble in the future. No doubt, this tightening, would be difficult to accomplish because the’ offi­cers lack sufficient authority, power and BACK­ING to accomplish much in that way.-;. . Sorry that there was any trouble caused because we have far from any hard, feelings toward "The Dormitory •Men.”* * * *
This and That—
We hear that after the Soph Hop there were, about six scarfs, two women’s coats and a dozen or more.-.sundry artcilcs found in and around This­tle Iiall.. Judging from this the check room con­cession should be quite desirable. . Maybe you don’t know why those notices have been posted in^’the Electrical clubroom,. but we Hive , a pretty fair idea. . . . We might also imagine that new grounds are being sought for the occupations - or activities formerly carried on in the above men­tioned “P and D” lab, isn’t that its name? Per- , haps Manno, junior mechanical could help out irk regards to new places. At any rate-he had better 
not let Joe Pock in on them, as Joe might want to study there, too. Incidentally, if many more no­tices are posted the pictures 'will-iiaye' io be taken 
down from the walls to make room. Even ’so,'1 with all these notices asking cdur'tesy'to !b‘e shown one can't_^do any real studying there for all' the noise made by most of the students present. . . . Might rename Skibo Inn as Lenz or Culbertson Hall, what with .the art students ^ ^ ^
we w i t n c ssed V |§ zx**//playing there. «R ¿¿Dr,Ii o w e vcr, we assure you there was nothin g s e n s a t i o nal about their playing, indeed, nothing. Did you know that-our own Howard Sprenkle was-the first to be publicly awakened jm “King George’s lecture? We also heard that- Mary Potts, the Beta’s pride has played only one game at intra­mural basketball. Speaking of Marvin, we also undestand the Tnter-fraternity dance will be cheaper this year and with a chance of having the most unique favors' 'ever given at a Tech affair, provid­ing they give favoYs. If it all works out the credit will be due most to “Rege” Binder, nice work, fellow.’ •'
Newman Club
The Newman Club has secured 
Jimmy Allen’s Virginians to play for 
their mid-winter formal dance to be 
held in the Knights of Columbus 
Ball Room on Friday, January 29, 
from 9 until 2 o’clock.
Jimmy Allen’s Virginians will be 
remembered by Tech students as 
having played at the Newman Club's 
Jinx dance which was held in No­
vember. Jerry Doran, president of the 
club and a stage craft student at 
Tech night school, is planning a 
modernistic black and gold setting 
for the affair. Alma Bradley, heads 
the decorations committee, and Helen 
Comstock, Mary Mulvihill, and the 
club’s executive committee arc. ar­
ranging for the other details.
Tickets may be obtained from 
Gertrude Novak at $3.00 apiece. At­
tendance is limited to the members 
of the 'Newman Club and their 
friends.
qe snUiv riteDt 
It was at the opening ,of the 
theatrical season at the famous 
Empire Theater in New York in 
1897 that playgoers had their at­
tention called to a suddenly ele­
vated “star,” a shy young woman 
of' twenty-five, Avhose endearing 
personality was destined to entwine 
itself about the hearts of a genera­
tion and live in our day as almost 
a legend. The bill-board read: 
“Charles Frolifrian Presents Maude 
Adams in ‘The Little Minister,’ by 
J. M. Barrie.”
With her beautiful performance 
as Lady Babbie in that delightful 
play began her felicitous creations 
of a series of Barrie heroines. It 
almost seemed as if the Scotch 
playwright drew his portraits 
from the lineaments of the spir­
itual pr9file of the young'American 
actress. Until “The Little Minis­
ter” had captivated by its inex­
plicable charm, Barrie had been 
known here only as novelist and 
as author of a sentimental comedy, 
“The Professor’s Love Story.” In­
deed, this latter play had lain in 
the trunk of an English actor, E. 
S. Willard, who often used to 
visit Pittsburgh, and only at the 
end of an' engagement in New 
York in the winter of 1892 was it 
with some qualms taken out and 
performed. Not the least thrilled 
of the spectators at the successful 
run was the manager, Charles 
Frohman, who conceived the aii-
thor to be the very man to supply 
the plays needed to reveal the 
peculiar’gift's of a new Frohman
Carnegie Kate Says:
"Isn’t college inefficient? While the costume and home economics girls are darning and sewing all kinds of miniature rugs and articles that will never be used, the boys over in the dorms are compelled to mend and darn their own socks and sew buttons on their own shirts.”
"find.” Forthwith, a photograph of 
a wistful and very feminine face 
was sent to Barrie with a.note of 
hope that a play for the young ac­
tress might be forthcoming. That 
picture of Maude Adams is still 
over the mantel in ‘ the hohie of 
the creator of Peter Pah.
But there are . cpuntless ~ intan­
gible facsimiles of. that likeness 
in the, memories of men and wom­
en who recall with a sentimental 
glow the magic spell -wrought by 
the loveliness of‘manner, sweetness 
of spirit, touches of pa'thos'. tender­
ness of a loving' heart, indescrib­
able nuances, in voice and gesture— 
all and more that compose Maude 
Adams.
Now, at the age of fifty-nine, 
Miss Adams has returned to ihe 
stage after a retirement of over 
fifteen years. Will her admirers 
fear to ' run the risk , of dispelling: 
a cherished memory?- Will her 
name convey any sense of glamor 
to the younger generation? Always: 
an actress resolute in clinging to 
her independently formed decisions, 
Miss Adams is answering those 
two questions by proceeding on 
what so far.has been a surprisingly 
successful tour in “The Merchant 
of Venice.” Her Portia • is bound 
to be inevitably personal and prob­
ably as interesting as the Shylock 
of Otis Skinner^ though greatness 
in either is not reasonably to be 
expected.
bunch of freshmen anyway? Take it 
easy. Get to know them over a 
longer period of time, and give them 
the time and opportunity to look over 
all _ the fraternities. The result will 
be more satisfied pledges, and they 
will have no false ideas about the 
crowd they have thrown in with. An 
appeal to reason rather than arti­
ficially created emotion is always 
more satisfactory in the end.
As to "sand-bagging” a rushee for 
any prolonged length of time, show 
me any lead-pipc artist on any cam­
pus that can keep a new man sold on 
his House without proper justification 
and in the face of open competition. 
Don't forget that a clandestine pledge 
is not honored by competing fra­
ternities.
Contact is What is Needed 
A fraternity conducting its normal 
program open to tlie view of fresh­
men. will .naturally attract men who 
are interested in just that sort of pro­
gram, and thejr will incline toward 
the group to which they are best 
suited. There is nothing gained and 
much is lost in preventing fresh­
men and fraternity men from min­
gling socially in the early part of the 
school j'ear. The Administration does 
not wish to curtail normal social 
experiences by the deferred pledg­
ing, rule. The only object is to pre­
vent new students from becoming in­
volved in too many extra-curricular 
activities during the period upon 
which may depend the success or' 
failure of their college careers from 
an academic viewpoint.
A Change is Necessary 
The author of this plan believes 
that any questions and objects can 
be successfully answered if they are 
but thoroughly considered from all 
sides. In any case, the matter is 
thrown on the table for the con-, 
sideration of the Interfraternity 
Council with the thought in mind 
that something should certainty be 
done to bring order out of the pres­
ent state of chaos. One thing is 
fairly certain, Carnegie will con­
tinue to have deferred pledging. The 
problem is what to do about rush­
ing. Why not simplify the ordeal as 
much as possible by complete^ 
eliminating it? S.R.—’29.

CLUB NOTES
Seniors, take notice! How's this' 
for a letter of application? It was 
written by.a Chinese student educated 
at PEKING UNIVERSITY.
“I am Wang. This is for my 
personal benefit that I write to ask 
you for a position in your honorable 
firm. I have'¿'flexible-brain"that will 
adopt itself to your business, and in 
consequence bring' good ' efforts to 
your honorable selves.
“My education was impressed upon 
me in the Peking University in which 
place I graduated No. T-(first).
"I caii drive a typewriter with good 
noise, and my English is great. My 
references are of the good; and 
should you hope to see hie they will 
be read by you with great pleasure.
My last job has left itself from 
me, for the good reason that the 
large man (employer) has dead. It 
was on account of no fault of 
mine.
"So, honorable'sirs, what about it?
"If I can be of big use to you I 
will arrive on some date, you guess 
when.”
Sigma Alpha Iota
As a result of the first call this 
3<car of Sigma Alpha Iota, national 
musical honorary for women, eight

Eta Kappa Nu
- The first semester initiation of 
Eta Kappa Nu, profcssiorial electri­
cal engineering fraternity, is Sched­
uled for Saturday, January 30. 
Those who will receive their keys 
at this time are Richard S. Smith- 
ley, senior ; Walter E. Osborn,, .sen­
ior; John E. Hardy, senior; Wil­
liam H. Nichols, junior, and Wil­
fred Uffelman, junior.
After the formal initiation in the 
afternoon, the meeting will adjourn 
for the initiation banquet which will 
be held at six o’clock at a place 
undetermined as yet. Although the 
speaker for the occasion has not 
been definitely determined, the Sigma 
chapter fèels honored with thé pres­
ence of the founder of the fraternity, 
Maurice L. Carr; who will say a few 
words. While Mr. Carr was a stu­
dent at the University of Illinois in 
1904, he conceived the idea and need 
for such an organization as Eta 
Kappa. Nu. He founded the first' 
chapter “for closer co-operation 
amoug, and mutual benefit to, stu­
dents and others in the profession, 
who by their attainments in-.college 
or in practice manifest exceptional 
interest and marked ability in- Elec­
trical Engineering.” The organiza­
tion has grown. until at the present 
time there are twenty-three chapters 
in the principal Engineering schools 
and Alumni organizations in the 
principal citics.
. Because of the large number of 
alumni members in the Pittsburgh 
district; several representatives are 
expected at the dinner.
Contribs
To the Author of “From the Fence.”
We wish to take exception to 
several statements and inferences con­
cerning dormitory men, which ap­
peared in last week’s “From the 
•Fence.” We refer to the article “Let’s 
Play Cops and Burglars!”
The editor is guilty of “digging 
up old dirt,” as the saying goes, in 
the matter of the recent fracas with 
the police. The matter is best for­
gotten. However, in, justice to the 
dormitory men, Tartan Reader, you 
must admit that in this article, which 
is obviously meant for dormitory 
men, it is decidedly unfair to infer 
that they are responsible for ; the 
tampering with the Westinghouse 
Memorial pointer at the corner, of the 
Library; that it. is unwise to print 
the remarks of the1 ” policemen con­
cerning “the men of the ‘ College,” 
thus keeping hot a resentment which 
has been, reduced, by this time, to 
a few smoldering ashes; that it is 
an extremely tactless act to print 
as a statement, the quotation of 
someone, “the majority of Dorm 
men are morons.”
The word “majority means more 
than half; the word "moron” a per­
son who is mentally deficient.
Between 400 and 500 men reside 
in the Dormitories and rank rather 
well with approximately an equal 
group in the Fraternities.
Facts speak for themselves vide 
an analysis of the Honor List and 
Scholarship rating as given in the 
Tartan about this time last year. Is 
there mental deficiency evidenced in 
this majority representation of “Tech” 
men?
Acts . speak for themselves and- so 
we would bespeak for the Tartan

freedom from unworthy and un­

characterized the Editorial group

reminder of- the second-^clause of 
the avowed Tartan policy:
. “To inaugurate and uphold Car­
negie traditions.”

"What is this thing called Love?” 
Love is a strong, complex emotion or 
feeling inspired, by something, as a 
person or a quality, causing one to 
appreciate, delight in, and crave the 
presence or possession of the object, 
and to please or promote the welfare 
of that object. If you disagree,

The first. Intcrfratcrnity Ball ever 
held at Carnegie was a social event 
of November 14, 1913. McDougall’s 
Auditorium in East Liberty was. the

there was no such thing as a. break­
fast. af^er the ball, because dancing 
began at 8;?$ and,lasted until 1 p.m.

Another faded tradition is the Fall

themselves in war paint and blankets 
and had a merry old time “whopping

In any review of Electra one must 
steer a hazardous course between 
the Scylla of flippancy and the 
Charybdis of owlish solemnity. Fair 
warning! In attempting to avoid 
cither, we may achieve both. Reports 
are that Blanche. Yurka and Mrs. 
Pat Campbell, in the New York pro­
duction of Sophocles’ Eleclra, snorted 
and boomed their audiience into a 
coma of disinterest. At- the opening 
of Euripedes’ Electra, current Tech 
production' under the direction of 
Prof. Chester M. Wallace, Miss Eliza­
beth Drake, without having recourse 
to booming, played the title role and 
held her listeners in tense con­
sciousness.
Electra is a supreme justification 
for revenge. Into the instrument of 
her vengeance, Orestes, her brother 
(Donn Bonhoff),' she breathes the 
fire of righteous fury. He kills 
Aegisthtis, ' their father’s murderer, 
successor in their mother’s affections. 
She overwhelms his hesitant coward­
ice with her contempt, and drives 
him to the murder of their mother,, 
Clytemnestra, (Janet Feather).
To the human fahlts and super­
human virtues of these Greek 'figures, 
Miss Drake and Mr.1 Bohlidff strove 
to give full force. The latter fell 
short of creating a tragic figure of 
power by the use of restraint Which- 
held too continuously to -the' same 
level. George 'Hildcrbrand, as The 
Peasant, did well enough by a role 
which, even in those days, appears 
to have been a thankless dramatic 
task—that of playing a noblchcarfed 
friend-of-the-family. As the.-Old Man, 
William Beale -achieved a deft, if 
conventional, portrayal. Miss Janet 
Feather intrigued this scribe by her 
incisive interpretation of Clytem­
nestra; she made the wicked mother
regal; and made her shamelessness 
almost sympathetic.
Castor (Regis Joyce), appearing in 
the clouds, pronounced justification 
and penance on the mortals . . . 
'ye walkers on the shores of death, 
a god hath counselled ye . . Of the 
other Hero (Donald Aikenhead)- one 
may say .only that, though decora­
tive, he seemed just a bit tired of 
it all. An afterthough—Robert Gill, 
as a Messenger made much of a hit, 
in a long, swift, speech which he 
kept quite distinct.,.
There is no.. escape . from the 
moroseness of Electra, unless you are 
diverted by the chorus. If you do 
not keep a stiff upper theatrical lip, ' 
you may be perturbed by this vener­
able device, a convention vanished 
from our contemporary stage,. Euri­
pedes holds back little; the char­
acters tell vividly all their inmost 
feelings; Fate holds the whip-hand 
rather than pathology; implication 
has small place in this play. Its 
dramatic height lies in its austerity, 
its relentless inevitability. The glum- 
ncss of the play is reflected in a 
setting—realistic, not stylized — of 
stark simplicity, sombre in color tone. 
This pervading mood of ever-flowing 
sadness might have had a smopthcr 
unity if some of the minor charac­
ters had been less glib and more 
articulate.
So, to this writer, those things 
most worth seeing in Electra arc; 
Elcctra—particularly in her quieter 
moments, as, for example, a splendid 
s^tenc in which she lets fall the 
very dregs of her. bitterness upon her 
dead enemy; occasional flashes by 
Orestes; the role of Clytemnestra, 
and the profound beauty of this 
tragic dramatic poem.
