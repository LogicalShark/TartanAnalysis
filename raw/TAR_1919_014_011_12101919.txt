Four Schools Council Ads on
Many Important Questions
Recognition Buttons for Plebes
and Registration Question Adted On
Labels Procured for Seniors.
The regular meeting of the Student 
Council was held in Margaret Morri­
son Hall on Thursday evening, De­
cember fourth with all members pres­
ent.
The following matters were consid­
ered: The Student Council Insigma
.which was proposed at a previous 
meeting of the Council was discussed 
more in’ detail. A motion was made 
and seconded that the members of the 
Student Council be awarded insigma 
for regular attendance at Council 
Meeting.
The suggestion that recognition 
buttons be given to all Freshmen who 
take part in school activities, other 
than athletic, throughout their Fresh­
man year was further discussed and 
a motion was made and seconded that 
the Student. Activities Board be au­
thorized to award recognition buttons 
to Freshmen such as meet the quali­
fications which shall be designated by 
that board.
The chairman of the Committee on 
investigations of the cost of foodstuffs 
and the price of board at the beanery 
reported that the cost per student av­
eraged about $1.105 per day. The 
price quoted in the catalog is .$6 per 
week and although at this rate the 
board amounts to some over $6 per 
week, it was found that the food pur­
chased for the beanery is of very good 
quality and as the actual cost of food­
stuffs has increased it is necessary to 
charge more than the amount quoted 
in the catalog.
Senior tables are to be reserved 
in the beanery and will be designated 
by printed cards.
Reports from the four schools con­
cerning the payment of council dues 
were called for. It was reported that 
many of the students have not paid 
the annual council dues of ten cents. 
All the students who have not paid are 
urged to be prompt in paying these 
dues into their respective class treas­
urers.
The president of the Council ap­
pointed the following committees: 
Ring Committee—
Miss Agnes Piper, M. M. D.,
Mr. Dreifus, Design,
Mr. Bremmer, Design, chairman. 
Commencement Invitation 
Committee—
Miss Harriet Stone, M. M. D., 
Mr. C. A. Stone, chairman. 
Freshman Regulation 
Committee—
Mr. Green, chairman, Design,
Mr. Grant stone, Science,
Mr. Haddaeus, Industries.
A request from the Student Body 
concerning a change in the time set 
for registration for the winter term 
was presented and discussed. General 
dissatisfaction seems to prevail among 
the students on account of registra­
tion day being set for the last week 
of this quarter.
It was moved and seconded that the 
secretary of the Council send a letter 
to Dean Tarbell giving in detail the 
reasons why the students wish to have 
the registration date postponed and 
requesting that registration for the 
winter quarter be postponed until the 
week following the Christmas vaca­
tion.

SUPREMACY CONTEST IS 
SUGGESTED TO FRATERNITIES
In conjunction with the Fraternity 
Basketball League it is suggested that 
a Fraternity Athletic Supremacy Con­
test be run off while the basketball 
league is in progress. This contest 
would in no way interfere with the 
basketball league, but in addition to 
the cup offered for the league it is 
suggested to give a smaller cup to the 
fraternity winning the supremacy con­
test; also to give medals to the men 
winning any particular event.
Seven events are suggested includ­
ing the basketball league:
First place to count 10 points, 
Second place to count 8 points, 
Third place to count 2 points.
The events are:
1. The basketball League,
2. Dipping,
3. Tug of war,
4. 25-yd. burden relay,
5. Chinning,
6. Dive and roll,
7. Hustle ball.
Each fraternity to be represented 
by ten men.
SENIOR CIVILS ORGANIZE
BASKET BALL TEAM
No kiddin', gentle reader, the Senior 
Civils have organized a basketball 
team. They are showing piles of 
“pep” even though they are weighed 
down with a heavy schedule, and other 
seniorial worries. (Society, we guess.)
On Tuesday mornings about 11:30 
a group of young men—a dozen or 
so—may be seen entering that hollow 
pile of poor-looking concrete—ah—er 
—our “gym”.
Who are they? Why do they ent­
er? What is their purpose? Bolshe- 
viki bomb throwers? Crap game? 
Something to drink? or what. Strange, 
strange.
About an hour later they may be 
seen to leave quietly. Why do they 
leave? Ah. To get away.
This mysterious phenomenen is re­
peated on Friday afternoon. Again, 
what is their fell purpose? Wherefore 
the pilgrimage to the aforementioned 
hollow pile of poor looking concrete? 
Why the inordinate fondness for that 
“joint”?
You may have guessed it, sweet 
reader of the “Tartan”. It’s the Sen­
ior Civils. going to and from basketball 
practice. •
They have whipped into shape a 
first-class basketball team and have 
been practicing consistently, twice a 
week, for nearly two months.
“Johny” Towns is manager. He 
says he does not wish to appear un­
duly confident, but believes that the 
team will beat up anything in sight, 
and many things out of sight. He 
takes this opportunity of challenging 
the basketball teams of the other de­
partments.
“Phil” Marshall was elected captain. 
“Phil” is nearly a team in himself. An 
exciting season is looked forward to.
Manager Towns would like to get 
in touch with the teams of other de­
partments in order to arrange a sched­
ule.

cals. .. .etc., Snap it up!
FOR STUDENT CLASSES
On Friday evening, December 12, 
Dr. F. T. Galpin will entertain the 
Yokefellows Bible Class of the First 
Baptist Church at his home, 4343 
Schenley Farms Terrace. All Tech 
students who attend or expect to at­
tend the class are cordially invited to 
come. The class has been very active 
this year and has made fine plans for 
the future. This party is expected to 
be one of the most successful events 
in which it will participate.
At the same party the Friendly 
Class for young women will be enter­
tained. This class is mostly made up 
of Tech and Pitt girls. The party will 
be one that none can afford to miss, 
as any one who has been to any of 
Dr. Galpin’s entertainments knows 
well.

INTERFRATERNITY DANCE 
LARGEST OF YEAR-NEW 
FEATURES ON PROGRAM
The Interfraternity Dance, held in 
the Duquesne Garden Ball Room, on 
Friday night was a great success in 
every way. It was very well attend­
ed, there being between 250 and three 
hundred couples there. The finest 
kind of dance music was furnished by 
Rhiel’s Orchestra, consisting of ten 
pieces. Incidentally, it may be said 
that the music from “Bohemia Unlim­
ited” is fine to dance to. The spot­
light dances were carried out in a 
novel way. There was one such dance 
for each fraternity, and the light was 
first turned on that fraternity's ban­
ner before being shifted around the 
room.
There were a number of special 
features. One young lady sang popu­
lar songs between dances. Miss Car­
oline Mering, of the Extravaganza 
cast, sang Egyptland. This number 
was received with great applause. 
During the intermission Messrs. Mul­
ler, Ried, Willard, and Hertz gave a 
syncopated exhibition of jazz in its 
jazziest form. They sang a number of 
the popular pieces in a way that kept 
every one laughing.
The committee which arranged the 
dance so well was Max W. Pohlmeyer, 
chairman, Nelson P. Rice and Russell 
M. Russell.
HO-
TECH FLYING CLUB PLANS 
IT’S FUTURE ACTIVITIES
The ex-pilots of the Army and Navy 
Air Services recently organized the 
Tech Flying Club at a dinner held at 
the Schenley Hotel. At this meeting 
they adopted a constitution forming 
a club consisting of qualified pilots at­
tending the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology. The officers elected were 
as follows:
M. E. Green.......................President
A. F. Diamond... .Vice-President 
L. T. Barry .... Sec’y and Treas. 
After the meeting a very delight­
ful dinner was served during which 
many reminiscences of battles above 
the clouds as well as a due proportion 
of “barracks flying” was indulged in.
The members then decided to hold 
an Aviators’ Dance on December 13, 
stepping out in true military style 
with Wings, Chevrons and Full Dress 
Uniforms.
The committee in charge consists 
of:
Guillowe............Science, chairman
Dake ........................................ Design
Hamilton ....................... Industries
Pilots who have not as yet turned 
in their names for this dance should 
do so at once so adequate prepara­
tions can be made.
-----------D-----------Plans are being made at Cornell 
University for a swimming pool and 
the organization of a swimming team. 
The figures on the cost of the new 
tank range from .$50,000 to .$70,000. 
It is not expected that the new pool 
wlil be finished before two years.
DIVISION OF THE ARTS 
HOLDS AN IMPORTANT 
MEETING OF STUDENTS
The student body of the Division of 
the Arts held an important business 
meeting last week. Balloting on the 
future athletic policy of Carnegie 
Tech resulted in a solid vote in favor 
of continuation of inter-collegiate ath­
letics. Discussion as to whether or 
not the student body wanted coach 
Steffen back revealed the fact that 
the general sentiment considered the 
question out of place, and highly in­
sulting to “Wally” in view of his de­
voted services to this institution. A 
unanimous vote in the affirmative was 
recorded on this question.
It was voted to make some minor 
changes in the Arts plebe regulations. 
It was voted to change the name 
School of Applied Design to The Di­
vision of the Arts wherever it occurr­
ed in the constitution.
With the extravaganza out of the 
way, the students are looking forward 
to the costume ball, the great event 
of the social year in that Division. A 
suggestion from the faculty that the 
Pittsburgh Society be allowed to at­
tend was turned down in short order. 
The students expressing the belief 
that if the ball is to enjoy its past 
success it must be confined to students 
and alumni of the Division of the 
Arts.
Mr. Ellington, who with the Patron 
is always a guiding light for the stu­
dents in preparing the decorations for 
the ball gave a very interesting talk 
on the plans for this year’s social clas­
sic. The chair was empowered to se­
lect a committee to begin prepara­
tions. With a record student enroll­
ment, and with inquiries from the 
alumni coming in daily, there is no 
doubt but what this year’s ball will 
surpass all previous ones.
E. A. Earley was unanimously elec­
ted to represent the Division at the 
coming athletic conference with the 
administration.

Attention Turned to Basket Ball 
Interesting Schedule Arranged
Many Old Letter Men Back
in Squad and Hopes are High
Princeton Here January 2, 1920
With games scheduled with Prince­
ton, Colgate, Pitt, Rutgers, and W. & 
J. the basketball team this season 
faces one of the most difficult, yet 
one of the most attractive schedules 
ever arranged for Tech's basketball 
tossers.
The schedule is arranged to contain 
fifteen games with two pending. Two 
trips will be necessary to fill out this 
schedule, one through the East at 
which time Franklin and Marshall 
(pending), Rutgers, and Lehigh will 
be played. A trip will also be taken 
at which time Allegheny and Grove 
City will be played. Two games will 
be played each with W. & J., Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh, and Allegheny.
For the past two weeks, a large 
squad has been practicing under 
Coach Bianchi, who is with us again 
this year. The prospects for a win 
ning combination are very good as 
there are seven letter men back in­
cluding; “Eddie” Green, Capt. of the 
1916 team and Abe Levy who was a 
guard on the same team. Capt. Car­
ey, Foxon, Abrams, Lynn, and Ilam- 
mann of last year’s team and “Red 
Godden of last year’s plebe team are
SENIORS ENTERTAIN
CLUB WILL
OPERATE SET
At a special meeting of the Radio 
Club of C. I. T. on Friday, December 
5 at 4:30 p. m. the constitution was 
read and accepted. This action places 
the club in a position to go ahead with 
its plans for the remainder of the 
year.
It is understood that the large an­
tennae will soon be up again, and the 
large 10 K. W. set will be in opera­
tion. The set will be under the con­
trol of the best operators of the club.
The club is now open for new mem­
bers and any men in the school de­
sirous of becoming a member should 
get into communication with the sec­
retary of the club. He can be found 
any evening after 10:30 in Dormitory 
G, Room 412. If you don't know any­
thing about Radio come into the club 
and learn something of the greatest 
science of the day.
---------V-----------
The honor system is being tried in 
the Chemistry Department at Rut­
gers. It is the first experiment Rut­
gers has had with this system.
Tuesday at lunch hour the Seniors 
entertained the other classos in the 
Recreation Hall. Two Seniors fur­
nished the music for dancing. Quite 
a few of the girls made use of the 
music and danced until time for the 
first afternoon class. It was certain­
ly a very good idea of the Seniors 
and every ono hopes the practice will 
be kept up. With so much musical 
talent in the school, volunteers should 
be found who would be willing to 
play.
The different class stUnts will not 
bo presented until after the Christ­
mas holidays. The Senior stunt is 
already selected and the girls arc 
practicing.
TRACK MEN START 
PRELIMINARY TRAINING
The first call for track men was 
sounded last Monday and a goodly 
crowd of athletics responded. All the 
short-distance men will now com­
mence their preliminary work which 
is so important to the sprinter. Coach 
Hazel and Capt. Schmidt are very 
much enthused over the present avail­
able material and both are confident 
of a banner season next spring. 
Among the old men present arc 
Schmidt, Gare, Hawkins, Nieman, 
Code, Russell. These men will fur­
nish strong compteition for the new 
men and with their experience a win­
ning combination will result. All the 
men have the true Tech spirit and are 
in the fight to the last.
also out for practice. Levy played a 
great deal of basketball while in the 
service and should be ready to step 
right into a position. There are also 
a number of new men out that look 
like real good material including 
Moon, Fletcher, and Dosey. Dosey 
was All-scholastic center of the school 
teams of Pittsburgh.

"THE THREE OF US” 
PRESENTED THIS WEEK
On Thursday and Saturday nights, 
December 11 and 13 the Drama De­
partment will present the first full 
evening show of this term which will 
also be a fitting closing to the first 
term of the year’s work.
The play to be presented is the well 
known play by Rachel Crothers en­
titled ::The Three of Us”. The work 
of Miss Crothers is well known and 
she is looked upon as one of Ameri­
ca’s foremost dramatic writers. Two 
of her latest productions are now be­
ing shown on Broadway.
“The Three of Us” is a four-act 
comedy drama laid in a small mining 
camp in Nevada. The play is full 
of tense moments filled with many 
witty sayings and good laughs. The 
entire production is under the direc­
tion of Mr. Wallace.
The following is the cast except 
that Miss Crowe will play the lead 
Saturday night and Miss Lotz Thurs­
day night.

A splendid program has boon out­
lined for tho annual Christmas Ba­
zaar given by tho M. M. Guild. Scv- 
oral now features are being introduced 
this year which will add greatly to the 
pleasure of all guests. Exhibitions of 
folk and eathotic dancing will bo giv- 
en by various groups of girls drawn 
from the different gym classos. Ono 
dance.in particular, tho Skater’s waltz, 
will certainly ploase ovory one. Ap­
propriate costumes for all tho dances 
are being made. The boar’s head pro­
cession will take place as usual with 
the singing of the customary old ong- 
lisli carols.
Tho first public appearance of the 
rocently organized Margaret Morri­
son Glee Club will bo mado tho night 
of the bazaar. This is a matter of 
great interest to the school as this is 
tho first time a girl's glee club has over 
represented Margaret Morrison. There 
are about forty members of the club. 
They will wear old English costumes.
In tho lino of good things to 
eat nothing need bo said. New 
features in this lino will bo tho alo 
houso, the pie man and the candy 
girl, and the ice cream booth. Every­
thing sold will be made in Margaret 
Morrison so it will be a good oppor­
tunity to sample the work of the far- 
famed "Maggie Murpli Cooks.”
Special attention is being paid to 
decorations. This work is undor the 
direction of the Arts and Crafts De­
partment. Some striking features are 
being planned. All decorations will 
follow as closely as possible the old 
English customs. The decorations 
and costumes will harmonize in this 
respect so that the spectator will be 
liable to think he has been transport­
ed to the old England of the ale house 
and the wayside inn.
Later in the program social dancing 
will take place.
The Guild and indirectly Margaret 
Morrison hopes that the rest of Tech 
will contribute to the success of the 
bazaar by coming and staying. No one 
who comes will regret it so let every 
Tech person and every friend of Tech 
do their share to reward the efforts 
of the workers.
Mary Louise, as president of the 
Guild is in charge of the entire ba­
zaar. The chairman of the different 
committees are Edith Ilobe, Helen 
Durst, Sannie Callan, Mary Danley, 
Eleanor McCarson, Margaret Griffin, 
Gladys Ramsay, and Helen Reid.
AVO CLUB DANCE 
TO BE HELD JAN. 9
The Avo Club of the Division of Ap­
plied Industries will hold the first 
dance of the New Year in the Union 
on Friday, January 9.
The committee in charge: A. W.
Grieb, chairman; G. T. Iladdeus, W. 
Rohrbach, A. Wally, and R. Totum, 
are working on plans to make this 
dance an exceptionally attractive 
gathering. It is assured that good 
music will be furnished and a gener­
ous number of much-appreciated 
“moonlights” and novelties will be of­
fered. As this is the first social func­
tion of the New Year, a good repre­
sentation from the Four Divisions is 
expected.

THE WINTER QUARTER REGISTRATION.
Dissent seems to have come into the student body against the proposed 
plan of the payment of Winter Quarter fees before the regular Christmas 
vacation. Here it is neccesary to represent both sides of the case so as to 
eliminate a misunderstanding.
The Registrar has asked that it be made clear that the plan is not one 
to fleece the students of their Spare finances but to be one of assistance to 
the Recorder’s Office. The latter office has much work at the opening of a 
term making out schedules and otherwise. By registering before vacation 
we would be giving them a two weeks’ advantage and thereby insuring a 
good fresh start on January 6, 1920. Therefore, any action taken by the 
student body in regards to payment of the fees on the specified date should 
not be in any way hasty—none should be taken until an understanding has. 
been reached.
In regards to the students, many have depended upon the vacation to earn 
enough in order to pay the required amount. In this case, which it is rea­
sonable to believe is true in the majority of cases, it is believe that the pro­
posed plan is faulty even if the Registrar has made arrangements to accom­
modate the needy. If all the others wore depending upon the vacation in 
order to create a good impression upon the family thereby increasing chances 
of a substantial allowance there would be no reason of criticizing the au­
thorities’ action. This is not the case, so why tdlk in circles. Simply, the 
plan is not liked.
In another thought, we believe that the Recorder’s office is increasing 
their work rather than decreasing it. Many students are doubtful of their 
return- true in the lower classes. Here the necessity of refunds and cor- 
rctions will more than ofi’set the advantages secured by the early-registratio.i, 
plan. What advantages are then secured by the scheme?
The necessary stop has been takon by the Council which has appointed j 
a committee to talk the plan over with the Dean of Men and the Registrar 
It. is hoped that a compromise will bo reached but let it be known that the 
plan is unfavorable to the majority of students which entirely submerge 
the indiiroront. Are the two offices not increasing their labors, one by th<' 
late registration of needy students, the other by the expected refunds and 
corrections?
APOLOGIES
We are willing to admit that the statements made concerning the Stu 
lent Volunteer Conference Committee last week wore a bit hasty. However, 
before going any farther, wo wish it to be understood that all comments 
were made for a point of information and not for a “rap”.
We extend our sincore apologies to the committee which-evidently felt 
bad about it and really had put quite some hard conscientious work on tin 
matter. We are informed that arrangements have been made so far to send 
sixteen men from Tech with the possibilities of more. The committee does 
not seem strong for publicity and promises to carry on the work to the best 
advantage; if we let them alone; so we will.

MURADS are made of 100% pure Turkish 
tobacco — the world’s most famous tobacco for 
cigarettes—grown about the Black Sea, in the 
Orient.
MURADS are also the world’s largest selling 
high-grade Turkish cigarette—and their greatest 
increase in sales in any year was in 1919.
Now don’t you agree, there is always a

It is true that “ordinary’ cigarettes cost a trifle less.

XÜ BUFFALO !!x
The largest and most elaborate ban­
quet ever held by the Carnegie Clan 
outside of the Pittsburgh district is 
being planned in Buffalo on Monday 
night, December 22 at the Statler 
iiotel. Arrangements are being taken 
care of by Darwin Curtis ’17 who 
during his school carrer, was one of 
Uie most active ever known.
rfonus Wagner is planning on be­
ing there also H. D. (Red) Godden 
.will be there. There is a large alum­
ni in Buffalo and with such a “blow­
out” Tech is going to shine. Invita­
tions have been sent to all the east­
ern colleges to have representatives 
there.
Notices have been sent out to all 
students whose home is within a 
radius of 25 miles of Buaffalo with 
return card enclosed. It is necessary 
that attention is given to them at 
once to plan on a definite number.
All students and alumni who live 
further than 25 miles are invited and 
those who expect to be there on that 
date. Be sure to notify those in 
charge if you decide to go.
For information see Richard Town­
send of the Division of Industries or 
T. R. Hinchley of the Division of 
A rts.
This affair will be felt very keenly 
here at Tech so plan to be there and 
have the time of your life.

PLAID VS. PANTHERS.
The day was one of Pittsburgh’s own 
The morn dawned bright and cold, 
And ev’rywhere about the town,
The tidings had been told.
For on that day the two home teams 
On glory’s field would clash,
While on the sidelines cheering mobs 
Their rivals’ yells abash.
T’was Blue and Gold against the 
Plaid
Whose flag was hung on high 
And which throughout that restless 
day
Was ne’er dragged from the sky.
Nor could the Panthers’ efforts bold 
In field or rooting stand,
Outclass the spirit of the Plaid 
Renowned throughout the land.
And high upon the shoulders strong 
Of students they were borne,
For Tech was more victorious 
Than Pitt of spirit shorn.
For when the Plaid was in the lead 
In gloom the Panthers sat,
But then when tables turn’d to them 
At old Tech’s men they spat.

That Brown is not a provincial col­
lege and is drawing each year more 
and more men from outside the New 
England States is conclusively shown 
by statistics recently prepared at the 
University. Twenty-six States, two 
American insular possessions, and 
four foreign countries are represent­
ed among the men in the undergradu­
ate body at Brown this year. Of the 
total undergraduate enrollment 2G.21 
per cent are from outside New Eng­
land. The Freshmen class is the larg­
est in the history of the University 
with 36.62 per cent of its students 
from outside New England, breaks 
all records for its high percentage of 
non-local men.

And now comes the rumor that the 
athletic department has appointed 
itself official critic of the future dra­
matic offerings. Apropos, we are 
reminded of a sample of dramatic 
criticism which the late Richard 
Harding Davis used to quote from a 
certain review of “Hamlet”:
“ ’In this piece, there is too much 
chinning. The author behind the 
times, and forgets that what the peo­
ple want nowadays is thrilling situa­
tions, brilliant dectective work and 
pretty girls. In the hands of an up- 
to-date playwright a sleuth would 
have been put on the trail of Ham’s 
uncle and the old man would have 
been hunted down in a way to lift 
the gallery gods right out of their 
boots. The moral of the piece is not 
good. The scene where Hamlet sasses 
his old mother sets a very bad ex­
ample to the rising generation. Our 
advice to the author is a little more 
action, a lot more sentiment and a 
spice of variety business in his next 
piece. In the play scene there was 
a chance for a barefoot and art 
dances that was entirely overlooked. 
TVy again, Bill!’ ”* * *

umn for the current scandal. We

Too much Turkish
or
Just enough Turkish?
IN one way, at least, smoking is 
exactly like eating.
The more rich and delicious a 
certain food is, the more care people 
take to avoid eating too much of 
it — for instance, plum pudding or 
candy.
The same rule applies to smoking.
Cigar smokers, for example, are 
today more careful' to avoid too 
many rich, heavy Havanas. (In fact, 
more and more cigar smokers now 
smoke cigarettes too, to help cut 
down the number of cigars.)
In the same way, cigarette smokers 
are learning that Turkish tobacco, 
delicious as it is, is so over-rich or 
heavy that a man can easily smoke 
too much of it.
But they are learning also that, 
instead of cutting down the number 
of cigarettes per day, they can cut 
down on the proportion of Turkish 
in each cigarette.
How to reduce on 
Turkish
^TTEIEY can do this by switching from 
straight Turkish to part Turkish, 
or "Turkish blend,” cigarettes.
The first Turkish blend cigarette 
ever made — and the one which has 
always held first-rank importance— 
is Fatima.
Fatima contains more Turkish 
than does any other Turkish blend 
cigarette.
Perhaps this is the main reason 
why so many smokers of straight 
Turkish cigarettes ke(ep switelling 
to Fatimas.
Less worry about 
"too many7’
ANOTHER reason undoubtedly is 
- the fact that Fatimas treat 
smokers so kindly. The Turkish is 
so perfectly "balanced” by the other 
tobaccos in the blend that Fatima 
smokers never have any worry about 
smoking "too many.”
AT any rate, whatever the reason 
ud¿y may be, Fatima keeps on attract­
ing more and more of those smokers 
who, if they preferred the fancy, 
expensive, straight Turkish ciga­
rettes, could easily afford them.
This is shown, of course, by 
Fatima’s record in having won the 
top notch in sales at so many of the 
fashionable clubs and hotels and 
other prominent places all over the 
country.
How much 
is "just enough”?
DOES not Fatima’s record seem to 
prove that this is the one ciga­
rette containing just enough Turkish? 
Not too much nor too little Turkish, 
but just enough. Make a test for 
yourself.
