Exploring the signi?cance of “dark matter” in theater
Lecture discusses human traf?cking
DANA KIM
Junior Staffwriter
Human traf?cking is a 
global problem, with 20–30 
million slaves being sold 
around the world today. It is 
extremely prevalent in the 
United States alone, with 75 
percent of U.S. traf?cking 
victims being, in fact, U.S. cit-
izens. The United States has 
been labeled as a “destina-
tion country” for internation-
al traf?cking due to the fact 
that we are considered to be 
a wealthy country and have 
expendable money for the 
exploitation of human prod-
ucts. Countries with instabili-
ties and weak infrastructure 
tend to be the “supply coun-
tries,” where large pools of 
vulnerable citizens in search 
of security and hope can be 
found.
This was just a portion of 
what director of programs 
for The Project to End Hu-
man Traf?cking, Lynsie Clott, 
discussed in Tuesday’s pre-
sentation titled “Human Traf-
?cking 101 and Local Cases.” 
Clott delivered a highly in-
formative yet unsettling talk 
on understanding this con-
cept of modern slavery. She 
provided the audience with 
a thorough de?nition of hu-
man traf?cking — whilst 
also clarifying the difference 
between human traf?cking 
and human smuggling — and 
the various ways traf?cking 
conceals itself in society in 
the forms of sexual slavery, 
commercial sexual exploita-
tion, forced labor, or forced 
servitude.
Clott provided hard-hit-
ting examples that illustrated 
the differences between the 
numerous forms traf?cking 
could take.
The ?rst example was of a 
traf?cking victim from China 
who had been given a forged 
passport and was tricked into 
coming to the United States 
with the hopes of “working 
in a nice hotel and making 
good money.” Upon arrival at 
JFK, her traf?ckers discretely 
transported her from the air-
port to a hotel room where 
she was forced into becoming 
a prostitute.
More extreme examples 
include such an incident in-
volving a girl whose earliest 
memories were of her par-
ents using her as the “star” of 
their child pornography ?lm 
to advertise her for commer-
cial sex. Clott connected this 
example to the fact that chil-
dren are frequently targeted 
and kidnapped by traf?ck-
ers, forced to beg for money 
on the streets, and cruelly 
maimed and deformed by 
their kidnappers to entice 
passersby into sympatheti-
cally yielding more money.
In the U.S., regional and 
inter-state movement of 
humans as products (often 
referred to as “running the 
circuit”) is much more preva-
lent than international traf-
?cking. The United States’ 
consumerist culture and 
the need to meet the inces-
santly increasing demand 
for goods are what fuel labor 
traf?cking. January is Hu-
man Traf?cking Awareness 
month, and it is crucial to ac-
knowledge the importance of 
spreading awareness and ed-
ucating ourselves. The gen-
eral population’s ignorance 
of issues regarding human 
rights violations and their 
prevalence in our country is 
what cultivates, if not exacer-
bates, this matter. There are 
countless resources available 
to educate us on the matter of 
human traf?cking. The Not 
For Sale Campaign and the 
United States Department of 
Labor can both be referred to 
as credible sources of infor-
mation on the issue. Slavery 
Footprint is also a very use-
ful tool that serves as a type 
of survey that allows users to 
“input select data about their 
consumer spending habits, 
which then outputs a graphi-
cal ‘footprint’ of the user’s 
participation in modern-day 
slavery (as quanti?ed by their 
consumption of items created 
by forced labor and child 
labor).”
To get involved at the in-
stitutional level, students 
can contact Jess Klein, the 
Coordinator of Gender Pro-
grams & Sexual Violence Pre-
vention, who organized the 
event.
Students receive advice on acquiring internships at Internship Showcase
KRISHNA RAO
Staffwriter
On Thursday, the Career 
and Professional Develop-
ment Center hosted the In-
ternship Showcase event. 
Student presenters, with in-
ternship experiences at com-
panies like Boeing, IBM, and 
AT&T, were able to speak 
with students currently 
searching for summer oppor-
tunities. Other organizations 
represented included govern-
ment agencies, nonpro?ts, 
and hospitals.
Beginning at 4 p.m., 
students were free to walk 
around the tables and 
interact with the presenters, 
who had prepared exhibi-
tions and displays of their 
experiences working with 
the companies. Some of the 
common threads expressed 
throughout the presentations 
included the application pro-
cess, the nature of the work, 
lodging and transportation, 
and words of advice.
The event was open to all 
majors, with various present-
ers representing a diverse ed-
ucational background rang-
ing from the humanities to 
engineering.
The presenters came 
across their internship 
opportunities in a variety of 
methods. Some used school 
networks such as TartanTrak, 
the Business Opportunities 
Conference (BOC), the Tech-
nical Opportunities Confer-
ences (TOC), or even the 
Alumni Directory. They were 
quick to mention that know-
ing people who work at the 
companies and having con-
nections is very helpful not 
only for getting the desired 
position, but also for access 
to information along the way. 
Most of the presenters had 
used an online application 
process for the company they 
interned at.
Others, like senior 
information systems major 
Laura Lodewyk, said that 
professors are a good re-
source for ?nding intern-
ships. Lodewyk interned 
with the Palau Financial 
Intelligence Unit through a 
program called Technical 
Opportunities in the Global 
Community. She found out 
about the internship through 
one of her professors.
“Professors within 
Carnegie Mellon often have 
connections to companies 
JAMES WHEATON
Junior Staffwriter
Last Thursday, the College 
of Engineering hosted a talk 
for its Center for the Arts Lec-
ture Series featuring Andrew 
Sofer, a professor of English 
at Boston College who also 
teaches at Harvard’s Mellon 
School for Theater and Per-
formance Research. The lec-
ture focused on Sofer’s idea of 
“dark matter” in the theater. 
In addition to his experience 
in the theater, Sofer is also the 
author of the book Dark Mat-
ter: Invisibility in Drama, The-
ater, and Performance.
Sofer’s interest in what he 
has christened “dark matter” 
began during his exploration 
of props and their role in the 
production of a play. Upon 
the realization that he “didn’t 
have the vocabulary” to de-
scribe what plays an impor-
tant role in the production but 
is not immediately apparent 
to the naked eye, he sought to 
investigate this concept fur-
ther, labeling this phenomena 
dark matter after the not quite 
understood force of the uni-
verse prized by physicists.
Confessing his nervous-
ness at having to describe a 
concept of physics to such a 
technically competent school, 
Sofer joked that he has it on 
good authority that “scien-
tists don’t know what dark 
matter is either.” Having no 
background in physics, Sofer 
strove to ?nd a de?nition that 
?t his criteria of unseen props 
in theater and found that dark 
matter, as coined by physi-
cists, worked very well.
As many at Carnegie Mel-
lon know, dark matter has 
never been directly observed, 
yet we know of its de?nite ex-
istence due to its effect on the 
matter around it. According 
to Sofer, dramaturgically, his 
dark matter has a de?nite im-
pact on the plot, yet is never 
seen. Some examples of this 
are characters that never ap-
pear onstage, hallucinations, 
or the narrated past.
To give us an intuitive ex-
ample of this concept, Sofer 
brings up two clips of perhaps 
one of the most iconic Shake-
speare scenes — Macbeth’s 
“Dagger of the Mind.” To 
emphasize the importance of 
dark matter, Sofer shares with 
the audience the rendition of 
the scene as acted by Sir Pat-
rick Stewart and directed by 
Rupert Goold as well as an 
interpretation acted by Jon 
Finch and directed by Roman 
Polanski.
In these two scenes, there 
is a crucial difference for the 
audience. In Polanski’s ver-
sion, the iconic dagger is 
portrayed on screen, while in 
Goold’s version, it exists only 
in Macbeth’s head. Having 
watched the two scenes, Sofer 
opened up the discussion to 
the audience, asking for their 
interpretation of the two 
scenes, and the impact that 
showing the physical dagger 
had on the overall tone of the 
play.
Overall, the general con-
sensus was that although they 
were both well-acted, the one 
that displayed the dagger on 
screen lent itself to silliness; 
the dagger, which was made 
using special effects from 
1971, was almost too fake 
for the naked eye to accept, 
even as a hallucination. Fur-
thermore, the visible dagger 
doesn’t allow the audience 
to choose how they view the 
dagger. It forces the watcher 
to accept one version of the 
events, and leaves nothing to 
the mind. As one participant 
of the discussion succinctly 
put, “It murders the imagina-
tion.”
Before transitioning onto 
his next tangential topic, 
Sofer emphasized one thing 
about dark matter: While the 
audience may not be able to 
perceive the prop, to the char-
acter within the play there is 
no difference between that 
which is seen and that which 
is hidden. To the actor they 
are the same, whether it is a 
?oating knife or a character 
we never actually meet or see. 
The key to props being dark 
matter is that we can feel their 
impact on the play by the way 
they affect the plot, the char-
acters, or the dialogue.
Sofer’s description of his 
theory next addressed the dif-
ference between terror and 
horror.
The scenes from Macbeth 
perfectly isolate the difference 
between these two terms, a 
difference that, according to 
Andrew Sofer, is paramount 
in understanding his theory 
of dark matter in the theater. 
According to his de?nition, 
terror is when we are afraid 
of something we cannot see, 
while horror is when we are 
afraid of what we see with our 
eyes. He cites the movie Alien, 
in which a team is hunted by 
a mysterious creature that 
is only revealed at the end. 
Sofer argues that the scarier 
parts of the ?lm are when we 
don’t know what’s going on, 
before the reveal, rather than 
when we see the horrifying 
monster. Much like the alien, 
our imagination is more pow-
erful than any playwright’s 
script or director’s decision, 
and therefore it is often ben-
e?cial to have props be dark 
matter.
Andrew Sofer’s theo-
ry of dark matter, as de-
scribed in his book Dark 
Matter:Invisibility in Drama, 
Theater, and Performance, of-
fers a unique perspective on 
theater. While focusing on an 
area in which many have ex-
pertise, Sofer has delved into 
a smaller realm that has not 
yet been fully explored in or-
der to bring a fresh opinion to 
the world of theater.

Three alumni from 
Carnegie Mellon’s School of 
Art have created a research 
clinic devoted to develop-
ing new ways of feeling and 
ways of feeling new. Alumni 
Scott Andrew, a current ad-
junct instructor in art, Ag-
nes Bolt, and Nina Sarnelle 
have entitled this clinic The 
Institute for New Feeling 
(IFNF). The institution will 
be geared towards work-
ing on treatments, thera-
pies, retreats, and wellness 
products.
In response to the idea 
that corporations in this 
country can be granted per-
sonhood, the Institute stat-
ed, “Anyone can be an Insti-
tute. Anyone can construct 
a belief system; or de?ne a 
new standard of beauty; or 
decide what is ‘good for us.’”
The Institute’s latest 
project, “Furthering Cream,” 
will be on display at the 
Miller gallery until Feb. 28. 
Their work will be one of 
many featured at the ex-
hibit, which is titled Maxi-
mum Minimum in Unum. It 
will feature other art works 
produced by Carnegie Mel-
lon alumni. The Institute’s 
performance showed how 
“Furthering Cream” is pro-
duced. The Institute advises 
guests to return to the ex-
hibit throughout the month 
to witness how the material 
crystallizes and ages, har-
vested and bottled through 
the IFNF cave system.
The Institute is devoted 
to ?nding ways for its found-
ers to connect with people. 
Their ultimate goal is to 
open a spa in Los Angeles to 
further their research in cre-
ating new experiences.

CMU Alumni create Autopod “Micro-taxi” that is turning heads in Shadyside
Carnegie Mellon alumni 
Tanuj Apete and Deepak Vid-
hani have created something 
new that is turning heads in 
Shadyside. The graduates 
have created a “micro-taxi” 
called the Autopod that is 
a three-wheeled, battery-
assisted bicycle surrounded 
by a lime green outer shell 
used to cover passengers and 
the driver. These rides run 
for about two miles or less 
through the Shadyside dis-
trict, although by April they 
will be operating throughout 
South Side, the Strip Dis-
trict, and downtown neigh-
borhoods.
Autopods partnered with 
the Shadyside Chamber of 
Commerce, which sponsored 
the rides. Chamber Director 
Tori Mistick stated “They’re 
fun, the color is great, and 
they’re very practical.” Rides 
are free during the weekends 
but cost $5 during the 
weekdays. Autopods pay the 
drivers $10 per hour on the 
weekends to accommodate 
for the free fares.
Tanuj Apete, co-founder 
of Autopods, thought of the 
idea during the winter of his 
junior year. “It got too cold 
for me to walk to class so I 
thought if only there was 
a way to get a quick short 
distance ride — something 
a taxi wouldn’t do,” Apete 
said.
Apete and Vidhani are 
undergoing plans to modify 
the vehicle with canvas jeep-
like doors that snap onto the 
shell, a lighter outer alumi-
num shell to decrease the 
weight of the vehicle, and 
iPhone mounts created from 
3-D printers.

CMU Celebrates Ninth Annual International Data Privacy Day
DEBORAH CHU
Staffwriter
Last Thursday, Carnegie 
Mellon hosted CMU Privacy 
Day, a six-hour event to cel-
ebrate the Ninth Annual In-
ternational Data Privacy Day. 
The  international holiday’s 
purpose is to “empower and 
educate people to protect 
their privacy and control 
their digital footprint,” ac-
cording to Carnegie Mellon’s 
website. Data Privacy Day has 
occurred annually on Jan. 28 
since 2007, and is observed 
in the United States, Canada, 
and Europe. The event took 
place in the Cohon Center and 
was open to the public. It in-
cluded a privacy clinic; a key-
note by Ed Felten, U.S. Depu-
ty Chief Technology Of?cer; a 
panel discussion with faculty 
members from Heinz School 
of Management and Public 
Policy, the School of Comput-
er Science, and the College of 
Engineering; and a poster ses-
sion detailing the current pri-
vacy research that is ongoing 
around the university.
At the privacy clinic, stu-
dents stopped by to learn 
how to protect their privacy. 
Information privacy and 
student security experts from 
Carnegie Mellon were present 
to educate the public, answer 
questions concerning privacy 
risks, and provide advice on 
topics such as online adver-
tising, social media, private 
browsing, mobile devices, 
and banks. Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Information Security 
Of?ce (ISO) also presented 
Ask the ISO, which provided 
information about what the 
ISO watches on the network 
and what actions are taken 
to protect privacy. The clinic 
was organized by the masters 
program in privacy engineer-
ing at Carnegie Mellon.
The Privacy Day keynote 
address, “Making Privacy 
Work for Everyone,” was de-
livered by Felten, with an in-
troduction by Andrew Moore, 
the dean of Carnegie Mellon’s 
School of Computer Science. 
Felten currently serves at 
the White House as the U.S. 
Deputy Chief Technology Of-
?cer, and is also the Robert E. 
Kahn Professor of Computer 
Science and Public Affairs at 
Princeton University and the 
director of Princeton’s Cen-
ter for Information Technol-
ogy Privacy. The keynote and 
following panel discussion 
were video-streamed live, the 
link to which can be found 
at http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/
privacy-day/2016/.
In his introduction, Moore 
quipped that “One of my pre-
dictions is that 2036 is going 
to be the very last year that 
the President of the United 
States is not a computer sci-
entist.” He praised Felten for 
being an ideal computer sci-
entist, stating that “his career 
has been profoundly techni-
cal and he has now, in many 
roles, taken that out to the 
rest of the world to improve 
the lives of people through 
computer science.”
Felten elaborated on the 
title of his talk, “Making Pri-
vacy Work for Everyone,” by 
posing the question on how 
to make privacy available and 
accessible to more than just 
people with economic and 
social power, or who are ex-
perts. He stated, “It shouldn’t 
require a law degree or an 
advanced degree in computer 
science to understand where 
your data goes when you 
browse the web, but nowa-
days, that can sometimes be 
the case.”
As for how to empower 
users in making important 
privacy decisions for 
themselves, Felten spoke 
about seeking improvement 
through policy and research, 
which could be done by hold-
ing institutions to their prom-
ises and banning deceptive 
practices, creating organiza-
tions to provide advice and 
guidance to users in terms of 
privacy, or developing ways 
to increase transparency to 
users.
A highlight of the talk was 
Felten’s discussion of “the 
importance of who is in the 
room when important deci-
sions are made,” and the ben-
e?ts of having more computer 
scientists involved in public 
service. One of the reasons 
for this is, as Felten stated, “to 
infuse our ideas over time and 
to infuse our mindsets.” Dur-
ing his time in government, 
Felten noticed that “often 
what’s needed from me … is 
some concept that is second 
nature to trained computer 
scientists, but not second na-
ture to other people.”
“There’s a way that com-
puter scientists think about 
these issues, which is kind of 
invisible in the policy world,” 
he said.
To justify bringing 
computer scientists into gov-
ernment, Felten referred to 
the success of economists in 
government. 
He pointed out that econo-
mists have “created career 
tracks for people in the ?eld 
which go into and out of and 
through government…. Econ-
omists think of their interac-
tion with the public and with 
public policy as a core mission 
of their discipline.”
Felton concluded, “We, 
as computer scientists, or 
as experts in any ?eld, have 
something that we bring to 
the table that is very valuable 
for these policy discussions 
and often missing…. It’s our 
responsibility to make sure 
our voice is heard.” He added, 
“Many of the major national 
challenges that we face … 
have computer science as at 
least a component of both the 
problem and the solution.”
Following the keynote was 
a panel discussion featuring 
Felten along with Carnegie 
Mellon professors Alessan-
dro Acquisti, a professor of 
information technology and 
public policy; Lorrie Cranor, 
a professor in the institute for 
software research and profes-
sor of engineering and public 
policy; Anupam Datta, an 
associate professor of electri-
cal and computer engineering 
and computer science, and 
Norman Sadeh-Koniecpol, a 
professor in the institute for 
software research. The panel 
was moderated by Ramayya 
Krishnan, dean of the Heinz 
School of Management and 
Public Policy.
After the panel discussion, 
a reception and poster session 
was held. Privacy research 
from Carnegie Mellon was 
presented, including “Can 
personalized face compos-
ites be used for implicit and 
covert targeted advertising?” 
by Sonam Samat, a doctoral 
student in the Heinz School; 
“Answering Questions about 
Privacy Policies Using Crowd-
sourcing and Automated Text 
Analysis” by Aswarth Dara, a 
masters student in the Lan-
guage Technologies Institute; 
and “Your Location has been

 Ed Felton, White House U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Of?cer, delievered the keynote address at this year’s Data Privacy Day at Carnegie Mellon. Felton’s address was aimed at clarifying the elusive concept of data privacy.  
Students share tips on how to land summer internships
or opportunities in the real 
world. If you have a professor 
who you enjoyed taking a 
class from, or whose research 
you are interested in, talking 
to them about career oppor-
tunities can be very bene?-
cial,” Lodewyk said. Lodewyk 
spent her summer helping to 
create a database for Palau, a 
small island nation in the Pa-
ci?c Ocean and was involved 
in an effort to digitize the 
country’s ?nancial records.
A major lesson to be 
learned for many of the at-
tendees at the conference 
was that ?nding an intern-
ship is not easy. Most of the 
time, there is no straightfor-
ward way of getting an in-
ternship, and often, failures 
are more common than suc-
cesses. Only students who 
are very driven and resolute 
in their search are rewarded.
Ashwini Ganpule, a 
sophomore double major 
in mechanical engineering 
and engineering and public 
policy, worked at the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) in Washington D.C. as 
a Congressional and Inter-
governmental Relations In-
tern. She said that in order to 
get an internship as a college 
student, one must be “really 
persistent about it.” Further-
more, she stated “I applied 
to twenty different places, 
at least, and maybe ?ve or 
six that I even got interviews 
with.” Ashwini put her skills 
towards advising and writing 
letters on policy decisions at 
the EPA as a part of her in-
ternship.
The logistics of intern-
ships was another matter 
addressed by many student-
presenters. Out of those that 
did not work at home, sev-
eral lived with other interns 
in subsidized housing. Com-
panies are usually willing to 
provide interns with lodging 
and a means to commute. 
Other times, students are 
able to stay in vacant dorms 
in local universities.
Overall, the presenters at 
the internship showcase en-
joyed their internship expe-
riences. Many felt as though 
they played important roles 
in the projects they worked 
on, with some presenters 
designing and implement-
ing their projects within one 
summer. As for the work 
environment, the students 
reported that coworkers 
and managers are generally 
friendly and helpful.
Internships are a great 
developmental process for 
many students. They help 
interns increase their skills 
and experience, and inform 
them on the career ?eld they 
are hoping to join. Stephanie 
Chung, a junior human-com-
puter interaction and busi-
ness administration double 
major, represented Bosch, a 
German based multinational 
electronics company. Chung 
worked in the company’s 
business development and 
project management and 
language services sectors. 
She said that her experience 
helped her solidify her career 
aspirations, stating, “Before 
this internship, I wasn’t sure 
what career path I wanted. 
Through this internship, I 
found out … what about 
project management I liked.” 
She added, “Now I know 
which classes to take, and I’ll 
appreciate those classes as 
well because I’ll be learning 
valuable skills from them.”
Students around campus 
have many such stories to 
tell about how internships 
proved to be an invaluable 
experience.

Uber, Lyft competition drives rates off a cliff   
EMILY GALLAGHER
Junior Staffwriter
Like many students, I ?ew back 
to Pittsburgh after winter break. 
Upon arriving at the airport I found 
the 28X to be full, and a line of 
people were wrapped around the 
corner waiting for the next bus com-
ing in a half hour. The bus was late, 
I was tired, and my bags seemed 
to grow heavier as I stood there, 
weighed down by both impatience 
and exhaustion. After being unable 
to board the bus when it ?nally ar-
rived, and with prospects looking 
bleak for the next one arriving, I 
decided to call an Uber, and within 
twenty minutes I was at the door 
of my residence hall, faster than it 
would have taken for the next 28X 
to arrive at the airport.
Since Uber was founded in 2009, 
the ride-sharing industry is one that 
has forever transformed not only 
how people view transportation, 
but also the availability of part-time 
jobs. Companies like Uber and Lyft 
not only give hope to people when 
they are running late and the bus 
hasn’t arrived yet, but also gives 
hope to people who have lost their 
job or can’t ?nd a job, and are facing 
the dire straights of unemployment.
My Uber driver from the air-
port was one such employee. As I 
learned from my long conversation 
with him, my driver was an acting 
student at Point Park University. 
He was attending classes at night 
while trying to make a living and 
care for his family during the day. 
He told me that the reason he loves 
ride-sharing is because he can make 
his own hours. If he wants to go to 
his six-year-old son’s play at the el-
ementary school at one in the after-
noon he can, because he just won’t 
accept ride requests during that 
time. If he has an audition, he can 
go to that and on his way back home 
earn a few hours of pay by picking 
up people who are headed in the 
same direction. “The system isn’t 
perfect,” he said, “but for people like 
me it’s a lifesaver.”
I have heard other, similar senti-
ments from both Lyft and Uber driv-
ers I have ridden with in the past 
few months. Ride-sharing provides 
a ?exible part-time employment 
option that allows drivers to make 
their own hours in order to accom-
modate the rest of their lives. In this 
same conversation with my driver, 
however, he mentioned that Uber 
has recently cut down the cost of 
rides, without giving any notice to 
the drivers. This, he admitted, is 
fantastic for the customers, but not 
so much for the drivers. What he 
was the most upset about, however, 
was the fact that Uber gave driv-
ers no notice in implementing this 
change. This past month Lyft has 
also cut some of their rides by 62 
percent. Once again, great for the 
customer, but not so great for the 
employee. Recent claims that there 
is a price war between Lyft and Uber 
are not far fetched. There certainly 
does seem to be a race between the 
two companies of who can offer the 
cheapest rides and attract the most 
customers.
If this price war continues, the 
price of ride sharing will just con-
tinue to get lower, bene?ting the 
consumer, but continuously hurt-
ing the drivers. It is important to 
remember that drivers need an in-
centive to continue working for the 
company. Not that long ago, these 
companies were offering drivers 
large monetary incentives to switch 
platforms, but these companies are 
now becoming so greedy and com-
petitive among each other that they 
risk collapsing their own system.
If Lyft and Uber continue trying 
to one-up each other, it may very 
well turn out that they will just 
keep losing drivers until the whole 
system falls apart. There is a very 
delicate balance that must be found 
between a price that will keep the 
customer happy and one that will 
continue to draw in drivers. I can’t 
say that I am not excited by the e-
mail I just got from Lyft this after-
noon about a 20 percent reduction 
in cost for the month of February, 
but at the same time I think of my 
driver that night and wonder if this 
change was sprung on him as sud-
denly as it was on me and how it is 
affecting him.
The ride-sharing industry is an 
ingenious one, and one that truly 
bene?ts all involved. It would be 
very sad to see it begin to crumble 
because of a few poor economic 
choices made by the companies in-
volved playing chicken with each 
other. There is no easy answer to the 
problem except to keep the prices 
fair and the company motives in the 
right place. Ride-sharing connects 
people who otherwise would have 
no reason to cross paths. So I chal-
lenge you to start a conversation 
with your next Lyft or Uber driver; 
you just might walk away with a sto-
ry that will impact your perspective.

Primary frontrunners doom GOP
DJAMENO NTOWE-FANKAM
Junior Staffwriter
Today, the Iowa caucus of?cially 
kicks off the race toward the presi-
dency. As Americans, we only re-
ally have two realistic options in 
terms of the type of people we are 
to vote for: Democrats and Repub-
licans. Despite the shift of the aver-
age American’s views towards being 
more moderate, we haves two par-
ties that are becoming more polar-
ized. The most interesting issue at 
hand is who the Republican Party 
(GOP) will choose to lead their 
campaign for the right to preside 
over the American people. As of 
now, the two front-runners in the 
Republican Party are businessman 
Donald Trump and Senator Ted 
Cruz, neither of whom are quali?ed 
to lead and represent the American 
people.
Overall, I feel that people are 
fairly reasonable, so a person as 
unreasonable as Trump getting the 
support that he has right now is un-
precedented. Clearly, he is an intel-
lectual of sorts, since he was able 
to turn a million dollar loan into a 
a billion dollar franchise, but the 
things that he says, the way he pres-
ents himself, and his beliefs make 
him seem like he would ?t better in 
a comedy script than in the White 
House. 
He is essentially the maverick 
of the mavericks, not only in the 
fact that he does not have any po-
litical experience prior to running 
for president, but also in that the 
method by which he expresses his 
opinions traps his own party. For 
instance, when he says something 
along the lines of wanting to prevent

About three years ago, the issue 
of mass surveillance emerged from 
government of?ces and entered 
mainstream conversation for the ?rst 
time. Edward Snowden, a former CIA 
employee, leaked information about 
massive, blanket surveillance pro-
grams run by the NSA with the co-
operation of the telecommunication 
companies. The intelligence commu-
nity was using programs like PRISM 
to clandestinely spy on the commu-
nications of regular citizens — in the 
name of “national security.” While 
it was unclear how invasive the pro-
gram was, indignation followed, and 
a massive scandal ensued; people 
had no idea to what extent their be-
havior was being tracked, and revela-
tions like this just seemed to con?rm 
even the most far-fetched conspiracy 
theories that the government is al-
ways watching us.
The backlash, spearheaded by 
some of the largest high-tech Silicon 
Valley companies — Apple, Google, 
WhatsApp, and more — was swift 
and decisive. Companies doubled 
down on encryption, or the scram-
bling of data to make it impossible to 
read without a proverbial key. Apple, 
with the release of iOS8 in 2014, en-
abled end-to-end encryption — es-
sentially throwing away the encryp-
tion keys, so that it became physically 
impossible for anyone to access cus-
tomer data. Google and WhatsApp 
soon followed suit with their own 
versions of end-to-end encryption.
Recently, the debate surround-
ing encryption and surveillance has 
restarted, following the attacks in 
Paris and San Bernardino, CA. Al-
though one can never know for sure, 
a commonly accepted belief is that 
it is much more dif?cult for govern-
ment agencies to intercept our com-
munications than it was a couple of 
years ago. As a result, some people 
have claimed that encryption should 
be weakened and have argued that 
the attacks could have been pre-
vented under the old system. It is 
The Tartan’s belief that such claims 
are nothing more than opportunistic 
fear-mongering that panders to the 
most base sensibilities within us. The 
so-called “bene?ts to national secu-
rity” are imagined, and they are at 
the cost of a complete loss of privacy 
for regular, well-intentioned, law-
abiding citizens.
Proponents of weaker encryption 
typically reference the above attacks 
and argue that if we could have 
found where the terrorists were talk-
ing and listened, the whole tragedy 
could have been averted. The prob-
lem is, there’s no evidence. Hindsight 
investigations have revealed numer-
ous tragically dropped leads before 
the attacks — mostly from available 
information that was simply ignored. 
Both the plots seem to have been 
hatched in person, with little to no 
online footprint. The one encrypted 
tool that was used — a chat app called 
Telegram — is based in Germany and 
is thus immune to U.S. encryption 
policy. There probably will be cases 
where the ability to read iMessages or 
WhatsApp messages might help law 
enforcement ?nd incriminating evi-
dence. Rather than catching terror-
ists, however, evidence is more likely 
to point towards drug dealers, small 
time shoplifters, people cheating 
on their spouses, and other people 
supposedly protected by the fourth 
amendment. Serious criminals and 
terrorists are most likely only going 
to use platforms — such as the afore-
mentioned Telegram — that they are 
con?dent are immune to monitoring 
for the crucial communications that 
intelligence agencies are looking for. 
More public, less secure platforms 
are used for propaganda and recruit-
ing, not discussing their next attack.
If weakening encryption had no 
negative repercussions, and made 
us even marginally safer, it might be 
considered a useful, if incremental, 
positive step. The problem is that 
while weakening encryption will be 
a negligible deterrent to terrorists, it 
leaves us wide open to attacks from a 
different nefarious element — hack-
ers. We cannot have a backdoor just 
for government agencies. If such a 
vulnerability exists, the “bad guys” 
will ?nd it. If agents from the NSA, 
CIA and FBI can break into your 
phone, you can bet that far scarier 
people can also break in, giving them 
access to, among other things, all 
your health information, your pass-
words, your credit card information, 
and your ?ngerprints. The past de-
cade has seen no shortage of lone 
computer geniuses single-handedly 
bringing down massive, suppos-
edly secure platforms and causing 
economic damage ranging into hun-
dreds of millions of dollars. In 2010, 
Google had its entire corporate infra-
structure targeted. While we cannot 
know for sure, most evidence would 
lead the blame straight to the Chi-
nese government. Even scarier, in 
December 2014, 40 million debit and 
credit card numbers were stolen from 
Target’s servers. In this case, the per-
petrators still have not been found. 
While strong encryption isn’t some 
golden arrow that can permanently 
prevent any such attacks, it is by far 
the best defense we have.
The technology for encryption 
exists and is in the public domain. 
We can’t just wish it away, even if 
we wanted to. Actual threats to na-
tional security will either switch to 
non-U.S. platforms or develop their 
own encryption. If we make it illegal 
to encrypt, or arm-twist mainstream 
technology platforms to use weaker 
encryption, we do one thing — com-
promise the privacy and digital safety 
of harmless, law abiding citizens.

Third party Bloomberg candidacy guarantees conservative President 
EMMETT ELDRED
Last Friday, former New York 
City Mayor Michael Bloomberg indi-
cated that he is considering a third-
party run for President, particularly 
if the race is between Senator Ber-
nie Sanders (I-VT) and Senator Ted 
Cruz (R-TX) or businessman Donald 
Trump. His intentions are noble: he 
believes that those candidates are 
too ideological, and he fears the po-
larizing impact that they might have 
on America’s already frayed political 
landscape. But there is no path to vic-
tory for Michael Bloomberg. Instead, 
running as a third party candidate 
will ensure a President Trump.
I get it. He prides himself on the 
pragmatic, objective leadership that 
only comes when you shed party la-
bels. He was a Democrat, and then a 
Republican, and then a nothing, and 
he likes being a nothing the best. He 
considers himself a centrist, and he 
thinks centrists can actually govern. 
He thinks the only person that can 
unite the country is someone who can 
straddle the middle.
He might be right. But he won’t 
win. The data he’s looking at is tempt-
ing: 60 percent of Americans want a 
third party, and a record 43 percent 
of voters are registered as indepen-
dents, more than are registered for 
either major party. While there’s an 
appetite for a third-party candidate, 
that’s simply not our political system. 
In our winner-take-all system, there’s 
really only room for two competitive 
candidates. In presidential elections 
especially, a third-party candidate 
simply can’t win because they need to 
earn 270 votes in the electoral college 
out of 538 total.
There are two possible scenarios 
in a three-way presidential election. 
First, all three candidates preform rel-
atively evenly. This is the best Bloom-
berg can hope to perform. In this 
case, they will split up the electoral 
college, and nobody will get to 270. 
Then, the House of Representatives 
gets to decide who the president is. It 
is remotely possible that the Repub-
lican House would prefer Bloomberg 
to Trump, but this would be unlikely. 
More likely, Republicans will stick 
with their party, even if it has become 
the party of Trump.
The more likely scenario is that 
Bloomberg gets 10 to 15 percent of 
the vote. The most successful third 
party presidential candidate in the 
past hundred years was Ross Perot in 
1992, with 18.6 percent of the vote. 
That’s not a very promising track 
record for third parties. Yes, party 
strength has diminished, but the par-
ties are still very powerful, especially 
in campaigns. When the Republican 
and Democratic candidates get the 
nomination, the whole party, and 
all its money, volunteers, staff, infra-
structure, and data get behind them. 
Bloomberg would have to build all of 
this from scratch.
So Bloomberg gets 10 to 15 per-
cent of the vote. The question is which 
10 to 15 percent? Bloomberg thinks 
that he will draw support from mod-
erates in both parties and from inde-
pendents. However, he will appeal to 
Democrats more than Republicans. 
Bloomberg supports many poli-
cies that Republicans hate. Perhaps 
Bloomberg’s most famous policies 
as New York’s mayor were his public 
health initiatives, such as banning 
smoking in restaurants and prohibit-
ing restaurants from selling large so-
das. Not many Republicans care for 
government telling them what they 
can and cannot do.
Since leaving of?ce, Mayor Bloom-
berg has focused on Democratic issues 
like gun control and climate change. 
If you think a nanny-state loving, gun 
hating, pro-choice, big government, 
climate change believer is going to 
draw many Republican votes, even 
moderate ones, you’ve probably nev-
er met a Republican. Many moderate 
Democrats, however, will be attracted 
to Bloomberg over Bernie.
In either case, Bloomberg doesn’t 
win, but he does split enough atten-
tion with the Democrat that the Re-
publican wins. Bernie might be far 
to the left, but he is not a Ted Cruz 
or Donald Trump. Like Bloomberg, 
Bernie is an independent with suc-
cessful experience as mayor. Bernie 
might not straddle the middle, but 
then again neither does Bloomberg. 
Bernie has a reputation for working 
across the aisle and leading practi-
cally, sponsoring more amendments 
than any other member of Congress. 
Bloomberg might not like it if some-
one as ideological as Bernie is on the 
ticket, but if Bloomberg runs against 
Bernie and Trump, he will hand 
Trump the White House.

College life gives rise to generation gap debate, growth
SYDNEY ROSLIN
It’s of?cial: I’ve graduated from 
the kids’ table. In the eyes of my fam-
ily, my matriculation to college means 
that I am no longer a child. Although 
I may not be ready to support myself 
and am living in the college bubble, 
I have reached that in-between point 
in family life where I have a life com-
pletely separate from my parents, 
but their house is still the place I call 
home. I am expected to be responsible 
enough to be able to take care of my-
self at school, but I am still expected 
to follow my parents’ rules. I am sup-
posed to be making my own decisions 
about my life, but my parents still ex-
pect to be able to weigh in on issues of 
importance.
However, the biggest change that 
I’ve experienced with regards to my 
parents comes in the form of my per-
sonal beliefs and opinions. While my 
views on the world have not changed 
drastically in the time since I’ve come 
to Carnegie Mellon, living away from 
home in a community of peers who 
are well-informed about the issues of 
the world has given me a platform and 
the freedom to explore what I believe 
in and discuss it with like-minded 
people. And while my parents’ opin-
ions on the world always made sense 
to me before college, it’s easy to simply 
go along with what you’ve been raised 
on when that is all you know.
I probably shouldn’t have been sur-
prised when I came home and found 
out that the views of middle-aged 
people and college students differ 
signi?cantly. Ideas that I had spent 
the past semester hearing about from 
my friends and classmates required 
explaining to my parents, and they 
did not always share my views. For 
the ?rst time in my life, I felt the strain 
of a generation gap. The truth is, my 
experience as someone growing up in 
2016 is different from the experience 
of someone who has seen the world 
change over the past few decades. I 
found myself explaining concepts of 
gender and sexuality, the opinions of 
my fellow students on world events, 
and news articles I had found on so-
cial media sites. In the three and a half 
months since I had started college, 
my world had expanded beyond the 
boundaries of my hometown at an 
exponential rate, and I was excited to 
share that with two of the most impor-
tant people in my life.
Furthermore, it seemed as if I was 
expected to share these opinions. Sud-
denly, when politics came up at the 
dinner table, my parents would turn 
to me and ask for my take on things. 
I was asked how I felt about current 
events, and also asked how I was 
keeping up with those current events. 
We had begun to realize that I, no lon-
ger a child and now able to vote, am a 
person with a political voice that can 
be wasted or cherished. My parents 
encourage me to be a well-informed 
voter, as well as an informed per-
son regarding the happenings of the 
world.
But what truly threw me for a loop 
was when my ideas and opinions did 
not match up with those of my parents, 
not because of a lack of exposure, but a 
simple divergence in our world views. 
Our discussions turned into debates, 
and I felt lost — for a good portion of 
my life, my parents were the people 
who had all the answers. As a kid, it 
felt like my parents were the experts 
of all things adult. In the presidential 
election that my middle school held in 
2008, I knew nothing about either of 
the candidates, as I was 11, but I voted 
for the person my parents were plan-
ning on voting for because it seemed 
like the right answer. When my mom 
or dad would talk about issues of the 
government, their views would seem 
more like fact than opinion. For a long 
period of time, they were infallible in 
my eyes.
Now here I was, doing the unthink-
able — disagreeing with my parents 
to their faces. That’s not to say that 
my views were completely opposite 
those of my parents, and in fact, we 
agree on a variety of issues. However, 
when our opinions didn’t match up, 
their voices adopted the “we are 30 
years older than you and have more 
life experience than a college student” 
tone. Yes, you should have an opinion, 
they seemed to be saying, but remem-
ber that you are still new to this world.
It was intimidating, and almost 
enough to make me concede. After 
all, I thought, what do I know? I’m a 
naïve 18 year old, I am ?nancially de-
pendent, and my life at school almost 
solely takes place within a few square 
blocks of land. My parents have grad-
uated law school, spent decades in the 
workforce, raised a family, and seen 
all sorts of changes take place in the 
world. Who am I to think that my inex-
perienced voice stands a chance?
However, sitting with the adults, 
or for that matter, becoming an adult, 
means not blindly agreeing. It means 
having an open mind to new ideas, 
but not being afraid to challenge those 
ideas when they don’t align with your 
convictions. It means realizing that 
parents, despite the years they have 
on their children in terms of life expe-
rience, are simply human, and there-
fore inherently imperfect and not al-
ways right. After all, if I can stand up 
to the people who raised me and insist 
that my voice be heard not as a child, 
but as a person who is on her way to 
adulthood, then I can hold my own 
when I need to speak my mind against 
anyone.
I have graduated from the kids’ 
table, and now I sit with the adults. 
My new position requires a signi?cant 
amount of responsibility; my opin-
ion matters, and so I have to be able 
to back it up with facts and passion. 
The conversation at the adults’ table 
can get intense, and so I must be able 
to hold my own. And while that may 
mean taking a path separate from that 
of my parents, it also means that I am 
growing up, slowly but surely.

any more Muslims from entering 
the country, the GOP establishment 
and the opposing candidates cannot 
disagree with him because a large 
percentage of their constituents feel 
that there should be some preven-
tative steps taken to decrease the 
amount of terrorist acts that are oc-
curring on American soil, and that 
Trump’s assertions could be on the 
right track. 
Since Trump has taken the ini-
tiative to appeal to a good number 
of Americans, it is possible his cam-
paign will come to fruition. Initially, 
it seemed that his behavior could 
only last so long, but despite how 
radical his beliefs are, he does not 
seem to be decreasing in popularity. 
As Trump said himself, if he were to 
go into a street and shoot someone, 
he would still have supporters.
In the case of Cruz, the people 
that know him and are not part of 
his inner circle do not seem to like 
him as an individual. For the most 
part, people would like to have a 
president that they feel that they 
can relate to or is generally a good 
person. Cruz may not be an individ-
ual that people feel would look out 
for their best interests. As a college 
student I would like to think that 
unless I was an absolutely horrible 
person, a former roommate would 
never bash my character and values 
online in view of the general public. 
Yet since Cruz reached the public 
spotlight, his college roommate 
Craig Mazin has been continuously 
posting about the character issues 
that Cruz was demonstrating in col-
lege. From what I have seem from 
Mazin’s posts, he does not seem to 
be doing this to gain “?fteen sec-
onds of fame,” but rather as a means 
of exposing to the general public to 
who Cruz really is as a person. 
In addition, Cruz has had issues 
with integrity during his campaign. 
Cruz claimed that he and his wife 
funded his campaign for the Senate 
in 2012 completely independently 
by liquidating all their assets. What 
he did say was that he had also re-
ceived a loan from Goldman Sachs 
to help fund his campaign. Not only 
did he not tell the public, he also 
omitted the loan from his campaign 
?nance reports, according to The 
New York Times. I know that it is 
not uncommon for politicians to lie 
or stretch the truth to win the pub-
lic’s sympathy, but if a man cannot 
be vouched for by his college room-
mate and has a history of hiding the 
truth, can he really be trusted to 
lead the country? 
There are other criticisms 
of Cruz, such as the generally 
pretentious vibe he seems to give 
off. There are even questions about 
the legitimacy of his campaign 
since he was not born in any one of 
the ?fty states or any of the Ameri-
can territories. 
Even Trump has brought up the 
fact that the people around Cruz 
do not seem to either like him or 
trust him. Despite the fact that Cruz 
is Trump’s biggest opponent right 
now, I think he brings up a valid 
point about the type of person that 
we want to lead our country.
These two candidates raise ques-
tions about the GOP as a whole and 
what it means to be a Republican. If 
the “leader” of the Republican party 
will be either a radical and illogical 
person or a person who does not 
seem to get along with others, what 
is the practicality of the party in the 
modern day? 
If the leader of the Republican 
party does not really ?t into what 
the general population feels should 
be done it seems that the party 
has two options. The ?rst option is 
for the Republican party to refor-
mulate its policies to comply with 
what a wider swath of the people 
believe in. 
The alternative is for the Repub-
lican party to die out and for an-
other party to rise and take its place 
beside the Democratic Party. This 
may sound unlikely, but this would 
not be the ?rst time in American his-
tory that a prominent political party 
has fallen. If you look back to the 
early 19th century, the Whig Party 
was once successful, but eventu-
ally lost power and collapsed when 
the party’s values no longer aligned 
with what people believed in. Whig 
party members migrated to a differ-
ent political institution. America is 
changing, and if the political parties 
do not re?ect this change, they do 
not deserve to be in charge of our 
laws.
When the Supreme Court made 
the prevention of same sex mar-
riage illegal, I had two thoughts. 
I thought about how much has 
changed over the last few years, and 
about how America would never 
have another Republican president. 
This second thought may actually 
be true since the general American 
populace is trending a certain way 
while candidates like Trump and 
Cruz are going the other. These are 
not the people that should be in 
charge if we want to keep progress-
ing as a nation. All in all, I feel that 
we as people owe it to each other to 
put people in power who represent 
what we believe. Any step that is 
not propelling us forward is a step 
that inhibits us from being the best 
country we can be.

The Zika Virus: A harmless harbinger
SHARON WU
Staffwriter
If you have been paying at-
tention to world news lately, 
chances are that you might 
have seen some headlines 
about the Zika virus. While 
the virus has been around for 
a while, recent surges in the 
virus’ prevalence have caused 
the disease to be pushed into 
the limelight.
Discovered in the 1940s, 
the virus has maintained a 
low pro?le until appearing in 
major outbreaks within the 
past decade. However, like an 
infectious disease, knowledge 
of the Zika virus is beginning 
to spread in greater propor-
tions among the general 
public. According to the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), the disease 
is typically transmitted when 
an infected mosquito bites a 
person.
For the most part, the Zika 
virus is not considered to be 
truly harmful. For every ?ve 
people that are infected with 
the virus, approximately one 
person actually becomes ill 
and displays symptoms, which 
include fever, rash, joint pain, 
and red eyes. In fact, due to 
the lack of symptoms, most 
people who contract the virus 
will never know that they 
were infected.
Found in tropical and sub-
tropical regions, the Aedes 
species of mosquito is the car-
rier of the Zika virus. After be-
ing infected by the virus, there 
is normally a 10 to 11 day incu-
bation period, after this peri-
od, a mosquito becomes capa-
ble of transmitting the virus. 
Areas with stagnant water 
sources provide an environ-
ment in which mosquitoes can 
breed and pass the disease to 
their offspring, so these areas 
further increase the number 
of carriers for the Zika virus. 
Besides mosquito bites, a few 
reports suggest that the vi-
rus could be spread through 
blood transfusions and even 
sexual intercourse.
In April 1947, researchers 
studying the development 
of jungle yellow fever in rhe-
sus monkeys within the Zika 
Forest of Uganda ?rst discov-
ered the Zika virus after ex-
tracting it out of the monkeys’ 
blood. Mice and monkeys 
in the laboratory were also 
capable of becoming carriers 
of the virus, according to a 
report in 1956.
Between 1951 and 1981, 
evidence of the Zika virus was 
found in blood samples taken 
from native African and Asian 
individuals. The ?rst outbreak 
of the Zika virus took place 
in the spring and summer of 
2007, where it had infected 73 
percent of 7000 inhabitants 
in the island state of Yap, a 
cluster of islands located north 
of Papua New Guinea. Despite 
the 73 percent infection rate, 
only a smaller fraction of the 
infected population actually 
presented with symptoms.
A few years ago, the Zika 
virus made its way to more 
islands, including French 
Polynesia, located west of 
Fiji. There some patients re-
ported having symptoms of 
a rare autoimmune disorder 
called Guillain-Barré syn-
drome, which causes paralysis 
of the entire body. Questions 
about the virus continued 
to arise as the virus moved 
into South America. Accord-
ing to the head of the World 
Health Organization (WHO) 
Margaret Chan, the mosquito-
borne virus has “explosively” 
spread in 22 countries and 
territories in the Americas 
since it was ?rst found in 
Brazil last May. There are 
new suspicions that Zika virus 
might be able to infect the 
fetus of a pregnant woman, 
an unusual trait that has not 
been found in other related 
viruses. Doctors suspect that 
the disease may be correlated 
with the increase in cases of 
microcephaly in newborns in 
Brazil, where the number of 
reported cases have gone from 
around 150 cases per year 
to approximately 4000 cases 
each year. Microcephaly is a 
potentially life-threatening 
condition which causes babies 
to be born with smaller heads 
and underdeveloped brains, 
so this increase in incidence is 
HOW THINGS WORKCMU chemist leads team to con?rm four new elements
YUE YIN
Staffwriter
The seventh row of the 
periodic table of elements 
is now complete. The fourth 
Joint Working Party (JWP), 
a small international group 
of experts charged to review 
whether the claims satisfy 
the criteria to be recognized 
as a new element, on behalf 
of the International Union 
of Pure and Applied Chem-
istry (IUPAC) and the Inter-
national Union of Pure and 
Applied Physics (IUPAP), has 
con?rmed the stable exis-
tence of elements 113, 115, 
117, and 118.
An element’s atomic num-
ber is what distinguishes one 
element from another. Each 
element has its own spe-
ci?c atomic number, which 
represents the number of 
positively charged particles, 
or protons, in the nucleus. 
In order to verify an ele-
ment’s existence and to assign 
it a de?nite atomic number, 
scientists use criteria estab-
lished by the Transfermium 
Working Group, which 
evaluates elements with 
atomic numbers above 100. 
These criteria are essential-
ly descriptions of possible 
experimental techniques and 
measurements. 
In an interview with The 
Tartan, Paul Karol, chair 
of the JWP and Professor 
Emeritus of Chemistry at 
Carnegie Mellon, explained 
this process and how it in-
?uenced the approval of the 
new elements.
“A particular dif?culty 
in establishing these new 
elements is that they decay 
into hitherto unknown iso-
topes of slightly lighter ele-
ments that also need to be 
unequivocally identi?ed,” 
Karol said. “In the future, 
we hope to improve methods 
that can directly measure the 
atomic number, Z.”
Elements which are un-
der review are identi?ed by 
the atomic number (Z) that 
they are set to occupy. Karol 
explained the production 
of Z = 118 as a matter of 
simple addition; by combin-
ing Z = 20 (Calcium) with Z 
= 98 (Californium) through 
fusion, one obtains Z = 118.
“That fusion, as opposed 
to a scattering or many other 
processes, so rarely results 
in a viable 118 product that 
one must be extraordinarily 
careful about identifying the 
product in the midst of many, 
many similar outcomes of 
the nuclear collision. It is 
truly searching for a needle 
in a haystack,” Karol said.  
A typical experiment, 
done in Russia or Japan for 
example, might run for a 
month, during which one or 
two candidate products get 
tentatively identi?ed among 
a sea of uninteresting sig-
nals. Then those candidates 
need to be measured to 
look for convincing identify-
ing signals that con?rm the 
interpretation that the result 
is valid. 
All those steps need to be 
vetted to be certain there are 
not alternative interpreta-
tions. Ultimately, the group 
follows guidelines in the cri-
teria to see whether or not the 
radioactive species proceed 
through subsequent decay 
steps that match previously 
identi?ed radioactivities of 
known elements. According 
to Karol, duplication of re-
sults is extremely important 
as well. This can take years of 
experimentation to achieve. 
The critical review 
process involves a small 
international team of experts 
who immerse themselves in 
the experimental record to 
see if the criteria have been 
met. 
The team communicates 
entirely through the In-
ternet and, although very 
enthusiastic about recog-
nizing new discoveries, is 
committed to looking into 
every possible alternative 
explanation of the results. 
This tenacity is necessary 
due to the high likelihood of 
false positives. Each time the 
JWP has been assembled to 
examine a discovery claim,

New polymer leads to self-repairing, arti?cial muscles
Researchers at North-
western University have 
developed a completely new 
hybrid polymer that could 
one day be used in arti?cial 
muscles or other life-like 
materials, drug delivery, bio-
molecules, self-repairing ma-
terials, and for replaceable 
energy sources.
“We have created a sur-
prising new polymer with 
nano-sized compartments 
that can be removed and 
chemically regenerated mul-
tiple times,” said materials 
scientist Samuel I. Stupp, the 
senior author of the study. 
The hybrid polymer com-
bines two types of known 
polymers formed with strong 
covalent bonds and with 
weak non-covalent bonds. 
The integrated polymer offers 
two distinct “compartments” 
with which chemists and ma-
terials scientists can work to 
create and showcase some 
useful features.
“Our discovery could trans-
form the world of polymers 
and start a third chapter in 
their history: that of the ‘hy-
brid polymer,’” Stupp assert-
ed. “This would follow the 
?rst chapter of broadly useful 
covalent polymers, then the 
more recent emerging class 
of supramolecular polymers.” 
The study was published in 
the Jan. 29 issue of Science.

Worm research shows regular patterns of aging
Previously, aging was 
thought to be determined by 
statistically random factors. 
However, researchers in the 
lab of Walter Fontana, Har-
vard Medical School professor 
of systems biology, discovered 
patterns which provide insight 
into the aging process.When 
examining the life span of the 
Caenorhabditis elegans worm, 
the team discovered a surpris-
ingly statistical regularity in 
genetic and environmental 
factors, suggesting that aging 
does not have a single discrete 
molecular cause, but is rather 
a systemic process involving 
many components within a 
complex biological network.
“There are many impor-
tant molecular changes that 
occur with age, but it might 
not make sense to call all of 
them ‘causes of aging,’ per se,” 
said Novartis Fellow Nicho-
las Stroustrup, ?rst author on 
the paper and leader of the 
research team. To monitor the 
worms’ life spans, Stroustrup 
constructed the Lifespan Ma-
chine, a device comprised of 
50 ?atbed scanners purchased 
from an of?ce supplies store 
that are capable of recording 
16 petri dishes every hour, to-
taling 800 dishes and 30,000 
worms. The Lifespan Machine 
recorded how long it took the 
worms to die   when certain 
factors were manipulated.

Immune system gene leads to schizophrenia clue
On Jan. 27, a research team 
published a study in Nature 
that examined variants of a 
protein that severs nerve con-
nections in the brain as a con-
tributor to schizophrenia. This 
study marks the ?rst voyage 
into biology for this research. 
The study is the ?rst time 
scientists have been able to 
move from genetic studies to a 
biological insight into schizo-
phrenia risk, says geneticist 
David Goldstein of Columbia 
University. “Genetics got us 
there,” he said. “That’s why this 
is a big deal.” By examining 
genetic material of more than 
60,000 people with or with-
out schizophrenia, the team 
pinpointed versions of a gene 
within the major histocompat-
ibility complex (MHC), a sec-
tion of DNA that helps the im-
mune system identify invaders, 
called complement component 
4 (C4) that elevates the risk of 
schizophrenia.
C4 also helps control syn-
aptic pruning, and too much 
C4 causes excessive pruning. 
According to Goldstein, some 
scientists suspect that synaptic 
pruning goes into overdrive 
in schizophrenia. Postmortem 
brains showed a de?ciency of 
synapses, for instance. But this 
study is the “clearest, strongest 
evidence we have of synaptic 
pruning” being implicated in 
schizophrenia, Goldstein says.

New technique changes nano-scale material production
Materials scientists at the 
University of Wisconsen-Mad-
ison have developed a novelty 
technique that creates nearly 
2-D sheets of compounds 
that cannot naturally form 
such thin material. This 2-D 
nanosheet, just a few atoms 
thick, has huge implications 
for the future of electronic 
and biomedical devices.
“What’s nice with a 2-D 
nanomaterial is that be-
cause it’s a sheet, it’s much 
easier for us to manipulate 
compared to other types of 
nanomaterials,” said Xudong 
Wang, a UW-Madison profes-
sor of materials science and 
engineering. 
The team applied a special 
sur?cant to a liquid surface 
heavy with zinc ions. Due to 
differing charges, the surfac-
tant assembles into a single 
layer at the surface of the liq-
uid, forming a nanosheet.
“Under the correct condi-
tions, a surfactant will self-as-
semble to form a monolayer. 
This is a well-known process 
that I teach in class. So while 
teaching this, I wondered 
why we wouldn’t be able to 
reverse this method and use 
the surfactant monolayer ?rst 
to grow the crystalline face.” 
The researchers described 
their ?ndings in the journal 
Nature Communications on 
Jan. 20.

Carbon dioxide in air converted into methanol fuel
Recently, researchers have 
demonstrated that carbon 
dioxide captured from the 
air can be directly converted 
into methanol fuel using a 
homogenous catalyst. This 
process would be successful 
in removing harmful carbon 
dioxide from the atmosphere 
and in providing an alternate 
source of fuel to gasoline.
The study was led by G. 
K. Surya Prakash, a professor 
of chemistry at the Univer-
sity of Southern California, 
and Nobel Laureate George 
A. Olah, a distinguished pro-
fessor at the University of 
Southern California. The 
researchers have published 
their paper on the carbon 
dioxide-to-methanol conver-
sion process in a recent issue 
of the Journal of the American 
Chemical Society.
A key factor in the car-
bon dioxide-to-methanol 
conversion process was ?nd-
ing a good homogeneous 
catalyst, which would speed 
up the chemical reaction 
and produce methanol at 
a faster rate. “We will con-
tinue the studies to develop 
more robust catalysts that 
work around 100 to 120 °C,” 
Prakash said. “We would like 
to perform the chemistry in 
a preparatively useful way, 
wherein there are no solvent 
or reagent losses.”

Proton beam treats cancer patients, fewer side-effects
According to new research 
published in The Lancet Oncol-
ogy, proton beam therapy is as 
effective as other treatments 
and causes fewer side effects 
in children than conventional 
radiotherapy. Proton beam 
therapy uses charged particles 
instead of X-rays to deliver ra-
diotherapy for cancer patients, 
and allows high-charged pro-
tons to be targeted directly at 
a tumor.
Researchers looked at 59 
patients aged between three 
and 21 from 2003 to 2009. 
The study found that, after ?ve 
years, the survival rate of the 
patients was similar to that of 
patients treated with conven-
tional X-ray radiotherapy, but 
there were fewer side effects to 
the heart and lungs.
“The major ?nding is that 
proton therapy is as effective as 
photon therapy (conventional 
X-ray radiotherapy) in cur-
ing these patients,” Yock said. 
“What is also very exciting is 
that it is maintaining these 
high rates of cure but doing so 
with less late toxicity, which 
has dramatic quality of life im-
provements.” The U.K. Depart-
ment of Health states that the 
treatment will be offered to up 
to 1500 cancer patients at hos-
pitals in London and Manches-
ter in April 2018.

Mini-nukes: innovative or invitation for destruction?
THATCHER MONTGOMERY
Contributing Editor
Last week in Student 
Pugwash at Carnegie Mellon, 
we returned to Pugwash’s 
roots and discussed a new 
development in nuclear 
weapons: mini-nukes.
While miniaturizing 
nuclear weapons (called 
mini-nukes or tactical nukes) 
doesn’t constitute complete 
disarmament, it’s a step in the 
right direction, or so claims 
the Obama administration, 
which is behind the effort 
to recon?gure older nuclear 
weapons into a modern, mini-
nuke format.
These new mini-nukes 
would be mounted to 
precision cruise-missiles and 
would have a “dial-a-yield” 
feature, allowing them to 
adapt in explosive power to 
match their target. The lowest 
setting would be 2 percent of 
the yield of the bomb dropped 
on Hiroshima.
The lowest setting is what 
has people worried. If nuclear 
weapons become much less 
dangerous, with less fallout, 
what is to stop the military 
from using them in less-than-
apocalyptic scenarios? Would 
they be used preemptively, 
instead of only in response 
to a nuclear attack? What do 
they mean for the theory of 
mutually assured destruction 
(MAD), the idea that no two 
nuclear-armed countries will 
ever ?re on each other due 
to the consequences of retali-
ation? This is a frightening 
scenario, but it also encour-
ages countries to resolve con-
?icts through methods other 
than all-out war.
While mini-nukes might be 
smaller and less destructive, 
the threat of MAD would still 
be maintained, either through 
the amount of mini-nukes, 
or by keeping some of the 
larger-scale warheads.
Because the United States 
still needs to have enough 
capability to enforce MAD 
(otherwise another coun-
try could destroy the Unit-
ed States without fear of 
retaliation on the same scale), 
some question what the point 
of miniature nuclear weapons 
even is. If they have the same 
overall destructive yield, then 
why would it matter what size 
they were? What’s the point 
in making them precise if the 
only case in which they would 
be used in would be total 
Armageddon?
And that’s where the worry 
comes in. If nuclear weap-
ons are more accessible, if 
they don’t have such mas-
sive collateral damage, then 
maybe they aren’t such a red 
line to cross. Maybe someone 
will be tempted to ?re off one 
or two of these little nukes 
simply because they’re much 
smaller and easier to use than 
conventional weapons of the 
same size.
If they’re only being used in 
the same destructive scale as 
conventional weapons, then 
maybe putting nuclear weap-
ons back in the battle?eld 
wouldn’t be so terrible. By 
removing their huge destruc-
tive power, nukes would no 
longer be the game-changer 
they were after World War II. 
However, keeping the nuclear 
weapons under a threshold 
level of explosive yield would 
be hard.
Most countries have a 
“?re-all-weapons” response 
policy to any nuclear weapon 
use. Even if the policy were 
changed, it would be hard to 
measure exactly the size of the 
mini-nuke, and what would 
happen if someone crossed 
the line, just by a little bit? 
The upwards creep in yield 
seems almost inevitable were 
mini-nukes to come into con-
ventional use, which is why 
they most likely won’t be 
used, at least by respectable 
governments. The same sort 
of agreements against chemi-
cal weapons or bombing hos-
pitals would also be made 
against using mini-nukes. This 
again brings up the question: 
if they aren’t to be used, then 
why do we need them?
Although mini-nukes are 
supposed to be a step toward 
disarmament, it seemed as 
though most of Student Pug-
wash was skeptical by the 
end of the meeting. Provid-
ing no clear bene?t, miniature 
nuclear weapons still hold the 
same dangers as traditional 
nuclear bombs, only with 
the added concern that they 
might actually be used.
Pugwash is a national orga-
nization focused on open discus-
sion of ethical issues in science. 
The original Pugwash confer-
ence took place in Pugwash, 
Nova Scotia, in 1957, sparked 
by the Russell-Einstein manifes-
to, which called for nuclear dis-
armament and peaceful con?ict 
resolution. Student Pugwash is 
a non-advocacy, educational 
organization on campus that 
discusses the implications of 
science, technology, and medi-
cine on society. This article is a 
summary of last week’s discus-
sion on the miniaturization of 
nuclear weapons.

Hugs and social support linked to physiological bene?ts
JOSH BROWN
SciTech Editor
Hugging is an art. There 
are so many moving parts 
to keep in mind as you wrap 
yourself around someone else 
— arm placement, head and 
neck placement, hug dura-
tion. There are multiple types 
of hugs — the “bro hug,” the 
“grandma hug,” and even the 
“awkward acquaintance” hug. 
Now, there is even evidence 
that hugs have psychological 
effects that translate to 
physiological bene?ts. Re-
search coming out of Carn-
egie Mellon’s Dietrich Col-
lege of Humanities and Social 
Sciences has pointed to the 
immunological and stress-re-
lieving effects associated with 
hugs, as well as an embrace’s 
connection with perceived so-
cial support.
The study, led by Sheldon 
Cohen, the Robert E. Doherty 
University Professor of 
Psychology in the Dietrich 
College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences, assessed 
404 healthy adults’ perceived 
social support, frequency of 
hug reception, and frequen-
cies of interpersonal con-
?icts and then exposed the 
participants to a common 
cold virus. The researchers 
then observed the individuals 
in quarantine to assess the in-
fection’s progress. 
The data suggests that 
hugs were responsible for 
one-third of the protec-
tive effect of social support. 
In a university press re-
lease, Cohen said, “The 
apparent protective 
effect of hugs may 
be attributable to the 
physical contact itself, or 
to hugging being a behav-
ioral indicator of support and 
intimacy.” While the mecha-
nism by which this occurs is 
not expressly understood, 
there is a clear psychologically 
reassuring factor in the act of 
being hugged. Social support 
in psychology is perceived 
or actual care provided by 
a social network, such as 
friends, family, or coworkers. 
Social support is, in essence, 
con?dence that you will be 
supported by your 
social network or 
the act of actually being 
supported by people. Social 
support affects people by “al-
tering [their] perceptions of 
their abilities to cope with ad-
verse events,” said Cohen. 
“Presumably 
perceiving that you have 
adequate support reduces 
the potential threat and im-
pact of a stressful event.”
Hugs essentially act as 
a physical manifestation of 
social support, effectively 
reassuring the huggers 
and lowering their stress 
levels, which is relevant as 
stress can actually suppress 
the immune system. In re-
sponse to stress, the brain’s 
adrenal cortex releases a 
hormone called cortisol, 
commonly known as the 
“stress hormone,” that re-
stores homeostasis, or proper 
functioning, in response to 
stress. 
According to data from 
the Dartmouth Undergradu-
ate Journal of Science, one of 
cortisol’s many functions is to 
suppress the immune system 
This means that during 
stressful situations, especially 
long-term ones, stress has an 
immunologically suppressive 
effect on the body, making 
one more prone to infection 
and disease. Interpersonal 
con?icts are one possible 
cause of this type of stress. 
If someone is in con?ict with 
members of his social group, 
for instance, this results in 
him feeling isolated, and this 
stress results in immune sup-
pression, which in turn, can 
lead to an increased suscep-
tibility to illness caused by in-
creased cortisol in the blood.
This is where the health 
bene?ts of hugging, and 
in a larger sense, social 
support, come into play. 
Feeling socially supported 
can mediate these stress-
ful feelings, and in doing so, 
affect the levels of cortisol in 
the bloodstream, which will 
affect one’s immune system’s 
ability to ?ght invading bodies 
and defend against illness. In 
essence, hugs, as a marker of 
social support, can decrease 
the severity of symptoms and 
perhaps even the duration of 
an illness.
While hugs produce some 
psychological bene?ts, it is 
worth noting that hugging 
a sick person will not cancel 
out the chances of you getting 
sick. Germs aren’t nice like 
that. It may, however, help 
the person being hugged 
to recover faster. Next time 
you’re hugging someone, 
take comfort not only in their 
warmth, but also in the fact 
that you’re doing your body 
and your mind good.

the process has taken be-
tween two and three years. 
Though it is a long time, it 
involves very careful word-
ing and rewording of the 
team’s interpretation so as 
not to criticize the founding 
researcher. They are very 
careful not to discourage re-
searchers from performing 
challenging experiments, 
and the committee makes it 
a point to be as clear as pos-
sible with their concerns. 
“Our draft recommenda-
tions are then sent to the 
laboratories themselves 
for technical review, not of 
our recommendation, but 
of the data we considered 
and the understanding of 
the chemistry and physics 
involved. That review takes 
a few months,” Karol said in 
an email interview with The 
Tartan.
“Back then to us for pos-
sible/probable revision, and 
then out to the Internation-
al Unions for peer review, 
followed by the inevitable 
revisions and ultimately to 
the journal [Pure and Ap-
plied Chemistry] for edito-
rial revision. All this chews 
through the calendar.”
As the chair of JWP, 
Karol said that he is always 
excited about new element 
discoveries. “They are be-
coming more and more dif-
?cult to achieve, yet more 
and more informative about 
what lies ahead, as far as 
possible surprises are con-
cerned.”
Though there are no 
practical applications of 
these newly discovered 
elements in the near future, 
Karol proposes that “if the 
chemistry is explored, it will 
give an important handle on 
what are the effects of rela-
tivity on chemical behavior 
for these very heavy atoms 
since the imposition of 
relativistic effects on elec-
tron properties in atoms is 
still theoretically primitive 
and further known chemis-
try would be of enormous 
use.” Further research in 
this ?eld would allow com-
mittees such as Karol’s to 
con?rm new elements with 
much more ef?ciency.

Why people play Powerball despite those abysmal odds
LULA BANKER
Personnel Manager
Winning the Powerball can 
drastically change a person’s 
life. All of that money could 
give a person the opportunity 
to buy that 1965 Ford Fal-
con that he’s always had his 
eye on. A factory worker can 
dream about buying a large 
house, getting a couple cats, 
and wearing a gown covered 
in Swarovski crystal. On Jan. 
13, the national Powerball 
lottery racked up a jackpot of 
over $1.58 billion, the largest 
Powerball jackpot in history. 
The day before the Jan. 13 
drawing, The New York Times 
listed the probability of win-
ning the jackpot as one in 
292.2 million. In fact, The 
New York Times reported 
that a given individual is 246 
times more likely to be struck 
by lightning this year than 
win the jackpot. So why does 
the temptation of the prize 
keep people coming back?
With odds as abysmal 
as this — and with these 
odds widely communi-
cated — there has to be a 
pretty strong draw to par-
ticipate. Carnegie Mellon’s 
George Loewenstein, Her-
bert A. Simon University 
Professor of Economics and 
Psychology, has engaged in 
research trying to determine 
what factors make such ter-
rible odds seem worth the 
effort and resources. In 2008 
Loewenstein, working with 
graduate students Emily 
Haisley and Romel Mostafa, 
developed an experiment 
that aimed to explain why 
low-income individuals 
spend a higher percentage of 
their money on lottery tickets 
than those in higher ?nancial 
classes.
Loewenstein’s experiment 
exposed participants to two 
separate conditions: one in 
which the participant was 
made to feel less wealthy, 
and the other in which the 
participant was made to 
feel more wealthy. Then the 
participants purchased lot-
tery tickets. The research 
team found that those made 
to feel like they had a lower-
income purchased more tick-
ets than their counterparts 
who were made to feel like 
they had a higher-income. 
Participants who were made 
to feel like they had a lower 
income selected their income 
grade from a large range, 
with $100,000 or below be-
ing the lowest category. Par-
ticipants who were made to 
feel like they had a higher 
income were given smaller 
ranges that started lower, at 
$10,000 and below, proceed-
ing incrementally, with the 
highest choice being $60,000 
and above.
Lotteries, Loewenstein 
said, give individuals a 
chance to dream big, and 
individuals don’t just buy 
into the dollar amount of 
the prize. They become 
enthralled by the idea of 
the lifestyle and experi-
ences that the money would 
afford them. Lotteries let 
people fantasize. But as 
Loewenstein further reveals, 
lower-income lottery con-
testants may purchase more 
tickets because it is one of 
the only opportunities where 
they have the same chances 
for success as those com-
ing from more privileged 
backgrounds. A wealthier 
person may have a better 
chance at getting a credit 
card approved, or gaining 
entry to a selective college, 
but a gamble, like winning 
the Powerball, is equivalently 
unlikely for everyone.
It is easy to brush off the 
idea of the Powerball lottery 
as being an outrageous waste 
of money, but people’s brains 
are manipulated by context 
and other ideas, and not just 
by the tiny chance of win-
ning. People who feel ?nan-
cially stuck, who feel con-
strained by circumstance, 
like to dream about what 
would happen if money were 
to fall into their hands. Social 
science helps to elucidate the 
mystery behind this pursuit, 
and helps to explain why lot-
teries endure.
The winners of the Jan. 13 
record-breaking Powerball 
hailed from at least three 
states. Though their chances 
were unbelievably small, 
these winners will continue 
to navigate the complications 
and some luxuries that result 
from abruptly receiving a 
generous amount of money. 
Hopefully the extravagant 
lives they buy will live up to 
their grand expectations.

cause for concern. However, 
more research is needed to 
make a conclusive statement.
After decades of main-
taining a low pro?le, the 
Zika virus has ?nally entered 
the spotlight in the realm of 
global health concerns. The 
concern has grown to a point 
where the El Salvadorian gov-
ernment is advising women 
to postpone pregnancy until 
2018. While the disease has 
not been actively transmit-
ted in the U.S., a handful of 
individuals that returned to 
the U.S. from overseas have 
been diagnosed with the 
Zika virus. The CDC has is-
sued guidelines recommend-
ing that women who have 
traveled to Zika-infected 
countries check in with their 
doctors.
The fact that the virus 
goes largely unnoticed fur-
ther complicates the matter 
for pregnant women. A lack 
of reliable tests makes it hard 
for women to know if they 
have acquired the virus and if 
the virus has interfered with 
the early stages of pregnancy. 
Currently there is no cure for 
the Zika virus, and the cur-
rent development of Zika 
vaccines could take years be-
fore entering completion. In 
the meantime, while in Zika-
infected countries, travelers 
are advised to use mosquito 
nets and wear mosquito pro-
tective gear.
As the virus continues to 
spread to more people and 
more countries, of?cials from 
WHO will convene in early 
February to determine if the 
Zika virus disease should be 
declared as a global public 
health emergency. With the 
decision will come interna-
tional guidelines that will 
coordinate a more effective 
response to the disease, in-
cluding the possibility of 
sending aid to countries bat-
tling with these outbreaks. 
Keeping the Zika virus under 
control requires a carefully 
planned and systematic ap-
proach. While the disease 
leads to devastating effects in 
childbirth, it is important to 
note that the disease is known 
to cause few symptoms in  the 
general population.

Cam Newton unfairly criticized for celebrating success
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Senior Staffwriter
Sports have always been 
surrounded by all sorts of 
superstition. Every baseball 
player has an at-bat ritual. 
Basketball players have free 
throw routines so speci?c that 
Houston Rockets guard James 
Harden once went to give high 
?ves to the air while taking free 
throws in an empty lane. Those 
superstitions are sacri?ces to a 
much more powerful force, the 
sports gods: the unknowable, 
omnipotent beings controlling 
all sports outcomes. 
The football gods in par-
ticular have found themselves  
invoked numerous times this 
month by football journalism’s 
old guard and a few letters to 
the editor in The Charlotte Ob-
server. What is it that these sa-
cred overlords have been sent 
to punish?
A cursory glimpse at the 
hand wringing throughout 
the football journalism world 
would indicate that one man is 
to blame for everything wrong 
with football today. That man 
is none other than Carolina 
Panthers quarterback Cam 
Newton.
What is Newton’s crime? 
In his own words, he’s “an 
African-American quarter-
back that may scare a lot of 
people because they haven’t 
seen nothing they can com-
pare me to.” Evidence suggests 
he’s absolutely right about 
that assessment.
Newton catches the most 
?ack for hitting the dab and 
otherwise dancing after he 
scores touchdowns.
The fact that this upsets 
people is baf?ing. Cam New-
ton celebrates when he scores a 
touchdown. He plays the game 
with the joy and excitement of 
a little kid. Childish qualities 
generally have a negative con-
notation, but there’s one thing 
everyone loves about children 
and that’s how happy they get 
when good things happen. 
A viewer has no stake in the 
outcome of a football game 
unless they’re gambling. It’s 
for entertainment. Don’t we 
want to watch people be ex-
cited when they accomplish 
things? There’s no excitement 
in everyone just putting their 
head down and playing — the 
game would have no charac-
ter. There would be no emo-
tional reaction to winning or 
losing because there would be 
no cost or payoff to outcomes, 
and that would be incredibly 
boring.
This only leaves one expla-
nation for the vitriol. Green 
Bay Packers quarterback Aar-
on Rodgers mimics a title belt 
after he scores a touchdown. 
New England Patriots quar-
terback Tom Brady screams 
until he’s blue in the face when 
the Patriots don’t score touch-
downs. They never get any 
signi?cant sort of pushback. 
However any time a black 
player starts dancing, sports 
journalists are suddenly yell-
ing about what bad role mod-
els they are.
The most disturbing and 
virulent example from recent 
years is when Washington 
Wizards point guard John Wall 
came out doing the dougie be-
fore a game. Colin Cowherd 
ripped Wall’s dancing apart, 
compared it to a bank robbery, 
and said he did not have the IQ 
to play the position. He then 
dug his heels in the ground as 
Wall rose to superstardom say-
ing “I’m a big believer when 
it comes to quarterbacks and 
point guards, who’s your dad?” 
It’s even worse when you fac-
tor in that Wall’s father died 
of cancer when Wall was eight 
years old, but the racial impli-
cations behind that are abso-
lutely screaming.
The calls to the football 
gods to punish Cam Newton 
for his dancing and his failure 
as a role model are no differ-
ent. Newton was even called 
out in a letter to the editor in 
The Charlotte Observer for fail-
ing to marry his girlfriend who 
gave birth to his son, further 
invoking the stereotype used 
to question Wall’s intelligence 
?ve years ago. Black players 
have their behavior policed 
in discursively violent ways, 
all hiding behind the idea of 
a platonic athlete that is seen 
and not heard. That’s a stun-
ningly dehumanizing way to 
treat someone and it has a long 
history of being used to mask 
racism as well.
I don’t know anything 
about Cam Newton personally, 
so I can’t say he’s a wonderful 
perfect human. Sure, tearing 
down opposing fans’ banners 
after games is mean, but it’s no 
worse than, say, when Phila-
delphia Eagles wide receiver 
Riley Cooper shouted that he 
would ?ght any black person 
in a concert, using more vio-
lent language. He’s now often 
praised for his work ethic. 
Newton has not done any-
thing signi?cantly wrong, and 
the anger directed his way is a 
scary barometer of sports jour-
nalism’s priorities.
When the Panthers and 
Broncos show down on Sunday 
in Super Bowl 50, two of the 
best quarterbacks in football’s 
recent history will go to work, 
and if Cam Newton runs in a 
game-winning touchdown, the 
football gods will hit the dab 
right there with him. I will be 
watching him with a smile.
SPORTS BRIEFS
Men’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s basketball team trav-
eled to New York to play the 
22nd ranked Violets of New 
York University on Friday. The 
Tartans defeated the Violets 
85–80.
NYU got off to an extremely 
fast start, establishing a 16–4 
lead in the ?rst ?ve minutes 
and extending it to 21–7 soon 
after. The Tartans fought back 
hard, and ?rst-year forward 
and center Patrick Ehland 
capped off a 15–2 run that 
put the Tartans up 39–37 to 
end the half. Although NYU 
again jumped to a large lead 
at the start of the second half, 
the Tartans closed in on the 
Violets. The lead changed 
sides several times in the ?nal 
minutes of the game, but se-
nior guard Jason Sebak’s free 
throws proved to be the differ-
ence in capturing the win for 
the Tartans. Sophomore guard 
Thomas Cook ?nished with a 
career-high 26 points, and ju-
nior center Chris Shkil contrib-
uted 19. The Tartans commit-
ted a season-low six turnovers.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
took on Brandeis University, 
losing 81–67. Though the Tar-
tans got off to an early lead 
thanks to Ehland’s efforts, 
the Judges were able to capi-
talize on a number of Tartan 
mistakes. Carnegie Mellon 
?nished shooting 36.5 percent 
from the ?oor while the Judg-
es shot 57.1 percent. Junior 
forward Jack Serbin scored 19 
points for the team.
The Tartans now stand at 
8–10 overall and 1–6 in the 
UAA. The Tartans will com-
pete against NYU at home on 
Friday, Feb. 5.
Women’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s basketball team com-
peted at New York University 
on Friday. The Tartans lost a 
close 75–74 battle against the 
eighth-ranked Violets.
The Violets held the lead 
for much of the game, but 
the Tartans managed to keep 
the score close. Junior guard 
Jackie Hudepohl managed 
to score off an offensive re-
bound, getting the Tartans a 
73–72 lead with 1:36 left in 
the game. NYU retook the lead 
with a three-point shot, but 
the Tartans still had hope left 
when Hudepohl was fouled 
on with six-tenths of a second 
left to play. Though she man-
aged to make the ?rst free-
throw, her second fell to the 
?oor, and time expired before 
the Tartans could attempt to 
make another play on the ball. 
Hudepohl and junior center 
and forward Lisa Murphy both 
earned 16 points for the team. 
Murphy’s 16 rebounds helped 
her record her ninth double-
double of the season.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
took on Brandeis University, 
winning 66–60. The game was 
a hard-fought battle over all 
four quarters, but the Tartans 
sealed the victory at the end 
of the game when they made 
four of six foul shots. Murphy 
led the team with 17 points, 
and senior forward Liza Otto 
scored 16. Murphy’s 10 re-
bounds recorded her tenth 
double-double of the season.
The Tartans now stand at 
14–4 overall and 3–4 in the 
UAA. The Tartans will look to 
improve on their performance 
when they play a rematch 
against NYU at home on Fri-
day, Feb. 5, and the competi-
tion will be ?erce.
Men’s Track & Field
The Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity men’s track and ?eld 
team traveled to Case Western 
Reserve University for the 9th 
Annual Battle for the Obelisk 
on Saturday. The Tartan men 
defeated the Spartans 78–58, 
but Case Western retained the 
obelisk by winning 146–126 
overall.
In the 800-meter run, 
sophomore mid-distance 
runner Evan Larrick crossed 
in 1:58.45 with senior mid-
distance runner Marc-Daniel 
Julien just behind him in 
1:58.52. Junior mid-distance 
runner Curtis Watro ?nished 
?rst in the mile in a career-best 
4:20.46. The Tartans swept 
the 3,000-meter run with ju-
nior distance runner Ryan 
Archer leading the way in an 
8:47.34 ?nish. Graduate dis-
tance runner Josh Antonson 
was second in 8:51.18 with 
sophomore distance runner 
Ryan Auld placing third in 
8:51.95. Antonson later placed 
second in the 5,000-meter 
run in a career-best 15:17.01, 
while senior distance runner 
Brian Bollens was third in 
15:23.03. The 4x400-meter 
relay team of junior sprinter 
Jonathan Perry, ?rst-year 
sprinter Christopher Bayley, 
?rst-year mid-distance runner 
Isaac Mills, and junior mid-
distance runner Owen Norley 
crossed ?rst in 3:25.37 while 
the distance medley relay 
team of ?rst-year mid-distance 
runner Mark Moody, Mills, 
Norley and ?rst-year distance 
runner Jared Moore won in 
10:42.05. Norley placed sec-
ond in the 400-meter dash 
in 51.18. Junior hurdler and 
jumper Don Boyer was sec-
ond in the 60-meter hurdles in 
8.80 with junior hurdler Mat-
thew Sheh  crossing third in a 
career-best 8.85.
The Tartans swept the high 
jump with sophomore sprinter 
and jumper Cameron Smith 
taking ?rst, clearing 1.80 me-
ters. First-year sprinter and 
jumper Rai Walters and Boyer 
tied for second as they both 
cleared 1.75 meters.
Sophomore hurdler and 
pole vaulter Thomas Mans?eld 
won the pole vault by clearing 
4.10 meters. In the long jump, 
Walters leapt a career-best 
6.95 meters, and sophomore 
jumper Eloy Fernandez won 
the triple jump with a jump 
of 12.95 meters. Boyer was 
third in both jumping events 
with marks of 6.27 meters and 
12.36 meters. The shot put 
saw sophomore thrower Da-
vid Trzcinski win with a mark 
of 13.80 meters as ?rst-year 
Kenny Sladick was third with 
a mark of 13.43 meters. Soph-
omore thrower Jacob Schofel 
placed second in the weight 
throw with a mark of 14.67 
meters.
The Tartans will next com-
pete at the Denison University 
Bob Shannon Invit on Satur-
day, Feb. 6.
Women’s Track & Field
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s track and ?eld team 
lost 88–48 to Case Western

Pole vaulter Grace Yee takes control of the competition
IAN TANAYA
Asst. Sports Editor
Junior pole vaulter Grace 
Yee was recently named East-
ern College Athletic Con-
ference (ECAC) Division III 
South Athlete of the Week 
and Carnegie Mellon Student-
Athlete of the Week for Jan. 
18–24 for her performance at 
the Denison Lid Lifter on Sat-
urday, Jan. 23. Yee broke the 
school indoor pole vault re-
cord clearing the bar at 3.20 
meters in the second meet of 
the season. The record was 
previously 3.10 meters and set 
by Lisa Marion Garcia in 2011. 
This is the second time Yee has 
broken a school record. Last 
spring, Yee broke the outdoor 
pole vault record twice. At the 
Dave Labor Invitational on 
Apr. 18, Yee bested the 3.10 
meter mark set by Garcia by 
clearing 3.21 meters. One 
week later at the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
Outdoor Championships, she 
cleared a career best 3.40 me-
ters. Though she has already 
proven to be an excellent ath-
lete, the materials science and 
engineering major is hoping to 
continue turning out excellent 
performances on the road to 
nationals.
At ?rst, Yee wasn’t sure that 
she would have enough time 
to join the Carnegie Mellon 
women’s track and ?eld team. 
“One of my orientation coun-
selors was on the track team 
and was like ‘Hey, come and 
try it out,’” Yee said. She de-
cided to take a chance and join 
the team. “The rest is history.”
Whether it’s an unscored 
meet or a ?ght for the UAA 
Championship, Yee and the 
team are always prepared to 
give it their all. “I know what I 
need to do for warmups, what 
I need to eat, when I need to 
hydrate.” With the prepara-
tion down to a science, it’s no 
surprise that Yee is ready for 
anything. “Eyes on the prize. 
I always have a goal I want to 
reach.”
The chemistry among team 
members is another critical 
component to the individual 
performances. “I would de-
scribe the team as a family. 
Everyone from the coaches to 
the trainers are very support-
ive of each other. Even though 
track is very individual, the 
team is very supportive for 
each other.” Yee credits both 
the coaching staff and the up-
perclassmen for providing this 
environment for success. “The 
coaches are de?nitely the key 
to our success, and I also think 
the upperclassmen have given 
more effort to bonding with 
younger members over time.”
The team has been steadily 
improving since Yee joined 
it as a ?rst-year. In 2014, the 
team ?nished with a sixth 
place showing at both the UAA 
Indoor Championships and 
the UAA Outdoor Champion-
ships. In 2015, the Tartans ?n-
ished ?fth in the UAA Indoor 
Championships and sent one 
member of the team to both 
the 2015 NCAA Division III 
Indoor Track and Field Cham-
pionships and the 2015 NCAA 
Division III Outdoor Track and 
Field Championships. This 
year, Yee is hoping the team 
will do even better. “The team 
has gotten a lot bigger, and a 
lot of the freshmen are very 
talented.”
Considering her future 
beyond college, Yee is set 
on carving a new path. “My 
goal is to join the renewable 
technology industry. It’s been 
hard to see how I’m going to 
get there.” Yee, however, is 
undaunted by the challenges 
she will be facing. She knows 
that she will have quite a few 
friends who will help her make 
it through these tasks with as 
much encouragement as they 
already give her as she read-
ies her next vault. “It makes a 
world of difference to know I 
have a community backing me 
up, and I always strive to re-
turn the favor.”

Concussion rates on the rise, athletes risking health

A leader on the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s tennis team, 
singles player Abhishek Alla, 
said that playing for the ten-
nis team gives him an outlet 
for competition outside of 
the classroom. The civil and 
environmental engineering 
senior from Hyderabad, India 
has showcased dominant play 
over the last couple years, 
competing as the Tartan’s No. 
1 singles player for the past 
two seasons and being named 
an All-American in singles 
both years.
When discussing his 
choice to participate in the 
team, he called attention to 
the break that tennis provides 
from a day full of academic 
activities. Alla embraces his 
participation in tennis for the 
sheer enjoyment of playing 
the game, alongside the com-
petition. “I’m playing more 
seriously only because that’s 
a release from academics, and 
its more to fun to be on the 
court than to be somewhere 
else.”
In high school, Alla 
competed at a sports acad-
emy where all students were 
involved in athletics. Com-
ing to Carnegie Mellon was 
a big change, but luckily he 
made the adjustment suc-
cessfully. “I came in prepared 
for [school] to be harder, and 
then I guess it started off go-
ing well the ?rst few weeks 
and then it just kept going 
that way.”
Entering school at Carn-
egie Mellon can de?nitely 
pose a challenge because 
of the amount of work for 
classes, and Alla noted that 
this creates an additional dif-
?culty for athletes balancing 
time with sports. He points 
out that late in the season 
there is importance in “stay-
ing on top of all the academ-
ics so it doesn’t affect playing 
in the UAAs.” However, Alla 
also observed that the im-
pact of sports can be a great 
positive force for the athletes 
in season. When in season, 
athletes learn to work ef?-
ciently for their classes, and 
use time outside of practice 
more effectively in order to 
operate under the added time 
pressure. Alla explained that 
since tennis teaches the play-
ers about “unconsciously ?n-
ishing work” when they aren’t 
playing, there is a lot of free 
time. “I couldn’t see myself 
not playing.... Without tennis 
you have so much more free 
time.” 
This makes a good les-
son for the younger athletes, 
since Alla said that the young-
er members of the team are 
still learning to manage the 
heavy academic load and ?nd 
balance with other activi-
ties. Alla sees losing sleep as 
the big pitfall to an student 
athlete looking to succeed in 
school and in tennis. He ad-
vised that “if you’re spending 
too much time on a problem 
you should just go to the TA 
and ask for help or just email 
someone instead of staying 
up for 12 hours doing it on 
your own.”
Successfully adjusting to 
the academic workload will 
be key for the tennis team this 
season. With a strong ?rst-
year presence on the team 
that is sure to be large part 
of the winning formula. Alla 
explained that a strong ?rst-
year work ethic this season is 
helping the new players make 
up for the loss of three of last 
years seniors from the varsity 
team.
Alla views this week-
end’s upcoming competition 
against Walsh University as a 
good test of how both he and 
the team stack up competi-
tively against the competition. 
In the tournament, he expects 
strong competition from both 
friendly and rival tennis play-
ers, including a strong players 
from both school whom Alla 
believes are likely to take the 
top seed in the match.
In addition to being able 
to cope with added academic 
responsibility, Alla explained 
the signi?cance of the coach-
ing staff in allowing the tennis 
players from both the men’s 
and women’s teams to train 
ef?ciently through the sea-
son. The tennis coaching staff 
must deal with limited court 
openings throughout the day, 
organizing times for all ath-
letes on both tennis teams to 
take advantage of the courts 
while they are closed to pub-
lic use during the day.On the 
whole, Alla’s experience han-
dling tennis along with a typi-
cal student workload helps 
him succeed both on and off 
the court.

Concussions and concus-
sion awareness are by far the 
most popular topics in sports 
medicine right now. In the 
last decade, there has been a 
large shift in the culture and 
attitude surrounding concus-
sions and their treatment. 
Many high-pro?le sports in-
juries involving concussions 
have brought this injury to 
the center of attention, and 
with good reason: the Center 
for Disease Control and Pre-
vention estimates that up to 
3.8 million Americans suffer 
concussions as a result of ac-
cidents and sports activities 
every year, and the amount of 
concussions in the NFL rose 
32 percent from 2014 to 2015. 
This massive increase in con-
cussion rates has prompted 
large-scale discussion on the 
dangers of concussions. A re-
cent movie titled Concussion 
details a narrative of an NFL 
player that experiences sig-
ni?cant mental deterioration 
as a result of multiple un-
treated concussions. The im-
pact of this injury on athletes 
has come to the forefront of 
the sports medicine discus-
sion, and scientists have only 
cracked the surface.
Concussions sustained 
while playing football have 
been shown to be the cause 
of a disorder called chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy or 
CTE, which is known to lead 
to suicide and mentally debil-
itating symptoms after retire-
ment from the NFL. For years, 
the NFL denied that there 
were long-term consequences 
to the frequent head trauma 
undergone by football play-
ers. Efforts to bring aware-
ness to the subject began in 
1994, but it wasn’t until 2014, 
when a study announced that 
in 79 autopsies of former NFL 
players, 76 of the them were 
diagnosed with CTE. 
The NFL has come into 
many legal issues with con-
cussions as well. In 2012, 
Kansas City Chiefs player 
Jovan Belcher shot and killed 
his ?ancee before committing 
suicide in the parking lot of 
the Chiefs stadium. The team 
is being sued by the family of 
Belcher in a wrongful death 
lawsuit, claiming that the 
Chiefs ignored Belcher’s cries 
for help because of concus-
sion-like symptoms. In 2013, 
?ve former Kansas City Chiefs 
players ?led a lawsuit against 
the team, wishing to know 
just how much the team knew 
about concussions, and when 
they had that knowledge. The 
players felt they did not re-
ceive adequate treatment and 
thought they had the right to 
know that continuing to play 
football would put them at se-
vere risk for disability later in 
life. The consequences of an 
untreated concussion are not 
to be ignored, and can poten-
tially be fatal.
So then what is there to 
know about how this danger-
ous brain injury works, and 
what exactly is it? A concus-
sion is usually a short-term 
brain injury caused by a 
jolt or sudden impact to the 
head, and can result in mild 
disturbance of brain func-
tion, usually without loss of 
consciousness. More rarely, 
concussions can cause brain 
swelling and permanent 
injury.
Symptoms of concussions 
include headache, dizziness, 
nausea, neck discomfort, dif-
?culty thinking clearly, trou-
ble focusing, and disturbed 
sleep patterns. Severe cases 
can include persistent vomit-
ing, disorientation, unequal 
pupils, and partial or full loss 
of consciousness. If a person 
exhibits any of these symp-
toms, it is imperative that 
they receive an immediate 
and thorough evaluation of 
their symptoms by a quali?ed 
healthcare provider experi-
enced in concussion evalu-
ation. Without timely diag-
nosis and treatment, a mild 
concussion can potentially 
cause more serious compli-
cations including further 
brain trauma or a prolonged 
recovery. When treated, pa-
tients receive a standard set 
of instructions to manage 
the injury, including mental 
and physical rest. Generally, 
any activity that provokes the 
symptoms of the concussion 
should be completely avoided 
so as not to prolong recovery. 
These activities can include 
reading, texting, watching 
TV or playing video games, 
and physical activity. School 
and the work associated with 
it can also worsen symp-
toms, and accommodations 
are often made for students 
with concussions, such as in-
creased time for assignments 
or test taking.
Most concussion patients 
return to sports or regular 
physical activities within 
three weeks after their 
symptoms begin. For athletes, 
the patient should be without 
symptoms for a full twenty-
four hours before beginning 
physical activity. Once the 
patient has been without 
symptoms for a day, they be-
gin a multi-phase progres-
sion of physical activity that 
may take several days if the 
patient has symptoms that re-
turn with increased physical 
activity. All athletes who sus-
tain a concussion must pass 
an evaluation with speci?c 
criteria before returning to 
play, including ?nal authori-
zation from a healthcare pro-
vider that the patient is com-
pletely without symptoms.
Traditionally, athletes that 
play contact sports such as 
football, hockey, and lacrosse 
are at higher risk for concus-
sions, though the majority 
of these injuries are a result 
of falls or motor vehicle acci-
dents by non-athletes. Young 
athletes in particular are at 
a higher risk of concussion 
and take longer to recover 
than adults because their 
brains and bodies are still 
developing.
The frequency of this 
injury among young athletes 
around the country, as well 
as in professional athletes 
means that something must 
be done to protect the brains 
of these players. What needs 
to be looked at is exactly why 
concussion rates have risen so 
sharply in recent years, and 
how we can create an envi-
ronment that will put young 
athletes at a much lower risk 
of serious brain damage due 
to contact sports. But for 
now, the important thing to 
remember is that if you ex-
perience these symptoms, or 
see someone experiencing 
these symptoms after a head 
injury or physical activity 
with contact, get them to a 
quali?ed healthcare provider 
immediately for an evalua-
tion. Even a mild concussion 
left unchecked can result in 
serious brain damage. Simply 
knowing the signs can save 
someone’s mind.

Mozzarella Sticks done right
Teach McDonald’s how to make some real Mozzie sticks
One of my greatest worldly passions is fast food. I 
love that I don’t have to wait in long lines. I love that 
if I spend more than five dollars it’s my own fault, and 
that it’s all so chock-full of delicious things that make 
you worry you might die at any point. Risk is what 
makes life exciting.
Recently, however, McDonald’s has played with my 
heart, and the hearts of millions of other blue-blooded 
Americans who just want inexpensive fried fast food 
without having to get out of the car. They expanded 
their menu with the addition of mozzarella sticks. 
Fried cheese on the dollar menu seemed like the 
best present McDonald’s could give us. This is one 
of those delightful comfort food options that you can 
have delivered with your pizza but not at a fast food 
restaurant. Sadly, we got our hopes up.
But once McDonald’s began to actually produce 
and sell their mozzarella sticks, many customers 
were in for an unexpected disappointment. The 
familiar cardboard take-out boxes contained three 
sticks of breading. But those sticks of breading did 
not contain any cheese. Cheese — the basis for 
mozzarella sticks.
Several users on social media posted photos and 
tagged McDonald’s to express their confusion, 
disappointment, even anger. McDonald’s responded 
with a confusing excuse: the cheese melted out 
while it was baking. First of all, I don’t understand 
how that much cheese just escapes in the oven, 
completely unnoticed by the line cooks. But even 
worse, why on earth are they baking their mozzarella 
sticks? The appeal of fried cheese is that it is fried. 
McDonald’s has rows of deep fryers, so why can’t 
these mozzarella sticks get a comforting oil bubble 
bath too?
If there’s one thing we’ve learned throughout this 
disaster, it’s that you can’t trust anyone. If you want 
something done correctly you have to deep fry it 
yourself.
Mozzarella Sticks, adapted from allrecipes.com
2 eggs
1/4 cup of water
1 1/2 cups Italian seasoned breadcrumbs
1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt
2/3 cup of all-purpose flour
1/3 cup of corn starch
1 quart of oil for deep frying — canola, vegetable, or 
peanut, depending on your priorities
1 16-ounce package of mozzarella string cheese
Something I think more people need to embrace 
is that you don’t need a deep fryer to deep fry 
things. All you really need is a large pot of oil, a 
thermometer, and some diligence. The real trick 
is finding out what heat-setting on your stove will 
keep the oil at the right temperature. For your 
mozzarella stick, the oil should hang out around 365 
degrees Fahrenheit. Depending on your stove, this 
will be around medium heat.
Now it’s time to prep the breading assembly line. 
You’ll have three bowls: flour and corn starch, egg 
and water, and the bread crumbs. Once you unwrap 
the cheese sticks and cut them in half, you can 
start to dredge! Each stick will go first in the flour 
mixture, then the egg mixture, and finally in the 
breadcrumbs. For best results, do this twice. 
It will result in a mozzarella stick that’s extra 
crunchy on the outside while the cheese has 
enough protection to get nice and melty.
Only fry one to three mozzarella sticks 
at a time. If too many sticks are in 
there at a time, the oil will get too cold 
and will result in soggy breading. In 
my personal opinion, soggy breading 
is almost worse than hollow breading. 
The sticks will only need about 30 
seconds in there, so pull them out and 
let them drain on a plate lined with a 
paper towel.
This may involve some more time and 
total money than a trip to McDonald’s 
would require, but in the end, you 
have mozzarella sticks that you can 
guarantee will be delicious and 
cheesy. In the end, it’s totally worth it.

Advice for awkward people
Hi Josh,
I’ve got a very strange 
but really severe 
problem. Throughout 
the year, I’ve seen so 
many of my friends 
grow as people, and 
I’ve remained pretty 
stagnant. I feel the 
same as when I came 
out of high school, and 
it makes me sad. I’ve 
been wracking my brain, 
trying to find the secret 
to their success and the 
reason I’ve been left so 
far behind, and finally 
I’ve settled on one super 
important thing that 
every one of my friends 
has, but I’ve never 
been able to obtain: an 
aesthetic.
 
It’s so hard to find one, 
especially because I 
don’t quite know what 
it is. I’ve studied all of 
the usual suspects that 
my friends identify as 
their aesthetics: ugly 
babies, President Obama 
sneezing, Tyra Banks’s 
facial expressions, all 
to no avail. I find it so 
strange how each and 
every one of my friends 
can claim an aesthetic 
so quickly in everyday 
conversation. 
I’ve even tried to claim 
one before them, but 
I’m not well-versed 
enough in the realm 
of aestheticism to 
differentiate an aesthetic 
from a regular sentence 
or annoying sound. 
Once, a bunch of us 
were sitting around, and 
an old lady slipped and 
fell in front of us, and 
I was like “That’s my 
aesthetic.” Everyone 
just looked at me for a 
minute and then went 
to see if the lady was 
alright. Got any advice? 
Will I ever be cool 
enough to have a sweet 
aesthetic?
Signed,
Fragile, Aesthetic-free 
Individual Looking for an 
Understanding of Real-
world Excitement
Hey FAILURE,
I’m sorry to hear that 
you’re having such an 
existential crisis. I’m not 
sure what you’ve heard 
or what exactly you’ve 
been studying, but your 
friends are probably just 
being ironic and using a 
humorous turn of phrase. 
Having an aesthetic, or 
a certain appreciation 
of beauty, a style, a 
creative philosophy, is not 
necessary for everyone. 
If you don’t have a daily 
creative pursuit by which 
you’re examining the world, 
it’s not crucial for you to 
have a fully fleshed-out 
understanding of what you 
enjoy in that way. You’ll be 
fine.
Peace, Love, and Puppy 
Dog Tails,

Friday afternoon, on the way home from the last class of 
the week, make a stop at the Miller Gallery. The current 
exhibition Maximum Minimum in Unum is an eclectic 
collection of fascinating pieces in a wide variety of 
media by alumni of Carnegie Mellon. The three ?oors of 
the gallery offer compelling glimpses into the power of 
minimalistic art of all forms.
The ?rst ?oor of the gallery contains arguably the most 
fascinating piece of the whole show. This exhibit, titled 
Furthering Cream, was created by the Institute for New 
Feeling, a company of sorts run by Scott Andrew (MFA 
‘13), Agnes Bolt (MFA ‘12), and Nina Sarnelle (MFA ‘12). 
This installation is a new part of their product line. The 
main component of the piece is a free-standing wall, from 
which, on two sides, steel gray soap dispensers are hung. 
The wall has cutouts on the bottom, and under each cutout 
is a towel, and under one, a pillow for the face. These two 
cutouts leave enough space so that individuals may lie 
underneath the piece. Though visitors to the gallery are 
not invited nor allowed to do this, on opening night of the 
show, two anonymous individuals lay in that spot as the 
production of the cream commenced.
Though I missed the performance, I was more than 
fascinated by the undertaking of these artists. The 
“cream,” which was initially released from dispensers 
on the ceiling, turned the areas around the wall into a 
cave-like dwelling, with stalagmite-like rock formations. 
According to the artists, “a geological process that requires 
hundreds or even thousands of years is compressed into a 
two-week cycle of regeneration.
In addition to the wall with the cream itself, there was 
a sample of the liquid in the sort of bottle it is stored 
in, which has a unique rounded shape described as 
“boundary-free.” Furthering Cream also showed an 
informational video about what the cream was exactly. 
Currently, the members of the Institute for New Feeling 
are aspiring to open a spa in Los Angeles someday in 
the future. The overall goal of the organization is to aid 
in the “development of new ways of feeling, and ways 
of feeling new.” I loved the intersection of innovation, 
entrepreneurship, and aesthetics present in this piece, and 
though I feel like I have a tenuous grasp on its true purpose 
and use, it still fascinated me.
While not quite so grand and bizarre, the rest of the 
pieces in the gallery were equally thought-provoking. On 
the second ?oor, one of two video pieces called “Burning 
House,” (by Carrie Schneider BFA ‘01) depicted a small 
house in the middle distance on a landscape, and the video 
was a time lapse of the house burning. When I went by, 
the video was showing a sunrise and there was something 
weirdly disconcerting and very cool about watching a 
house burn in such a serene setting. Another piece on 
the second ?oor which really caught my eye was Laleh 
Mehran’s (MFA ‘97) Entropic System: a golden geometric 
shape with a sharp point was attached to a “drawing 
machine,” which almost imperceptibly moved the point on 
the shape around in dark-colored sand, making small lines 
and designs in a random — dare I say, entropic — way.
I am a sucker for glass art pieces, having a passion for art-
making in the medium, so I also really liked Ron Desmett’s 
(MFA ‘79) Persephone’s Garden. Made from blown glass, 
cold worked glass, and other media, the piece had an air 
of a vase having been knocked over, spilling ?owers and 
contents. There is something so satisfying in the beautiful 
twists of glass.
The show contained a couple pieces in reaction to the 
Black Lives Matter movement. Jina Valentine’s (BFA ‘01) 
piece “Explication de texte: ... SHOT MY SON,” was made 
in reaction to police violence against young, black men. 
In her artist’s statement, Valentine acknowledged her 
inability to empathize with the mothers of such violence 
as trying to ?nd words to convey the strength of their grief 
is impossible. Her piece is an homage to how language 
is limited in its portrayal of such tragedy and unrest. 
Valentine states that it is incredibly dif?cult to bridge 
between sympathy and empathy through just language.
Valentine invites you to take a sample of her piece: a folded 
newspaper. Instead of clear, legible text, the artist took 
the phrase “[...] shot my son,” from The New York Times, 
and magni?ed it 20 times. On the pages of the newspaper, 
each of the individual words stand as a composite of 
hundreds of these scans. The work really forces the viewer 
to think about what can and cannot be understood, and 
what emotions can and cannot be truly communicated as 
hard as everyone may try, which is an important lesson 
when it comes to relating to others and their experiences.
Numerous other pieces in the exhibit are just as 
fascinating. It truly is incredibe how so much can be done 
with so little. The Miller Gallery is open noon to 6 p.m., 
Tuesday through Sunday.

Kanye West’s Waves is likely to disappoint 
Tracks released so far indicate a continuation to the decline from greatness that started with Yeezus
In case you weren’t aware, on Feb. 11 the world is set 
to receive “the greatest album of all time,” according to 
Kanye West. The album? Waves by Kanye West. This 
will be Ye’s seventh studio album in what has already 
proven a legendary career, and while there are many 
(none so much as West himself) who are certain Waves 
will blaze new trails in hip-hop and set trends that will 
be followed for years, I personally think the opposite. I 
think Waves is going to stink, pretty badly, and I’ll tell 
you why.
Kanye burst into the public spotlight in 2004 with The 
College Dropout, and from there released classic after 
classic for the next six years. His beats changed how 
rap sounded, his polo shirts changed how rappers 
looked, and his overall attitude allowed mainstream 
rappers to be artistic and sensitive instead of simply 
dangerous. Without Kanye there is no Kid Cudi, no 
Drake, no Kendrick, no Lupe Fiasco, no J. Cole. In 
2007, Kanye was mixing rap and dance music and 
introducing a new generation to Daft Punk with 
“Stronger” two years before The Black Eyed Peas 
released “I Gotta Feeling” and the EDM explosion 
began. Kanye’s taste-making abilities were so 
respected that George W. Bush — whose time in of?ce 
saw 9/11, the Iraq War, and Hurricane Katrina — said 
that Kanye saying he didn’t care about black people 
was one of the worst moments of his presidency! 
How’s Bush going to come back from such a diss?
In 2009, Kanye had his own career low-point when he 
rushed the stage to proclaim Beyoncé’s music video 
was better than Taylor Swift’s at the VMAs. After that, 
everyone in the world seemed to think West was the 
biggest “jackass,” to borrow President Obama’s exact 
words, in the world. Under that cloud of intense public 
scorn, Kanye retreated to Hawaii to create what will 
undoubtedly go down as his masterpiece: My Beautiful 
Dark Twisted Fantasy.
Fantasy has no real equivalent, whether it is amongst 
West’s catalog, the wider rap catalog, or popular 
music in general. It’s an album that sounds so unique 
and so fresh that it could be released in seemingly 
any era and would still sound just as trailblazing. He 
struck the perfect chord between electronic sampling 
experimentation (“Runaway”), pop bombast (“All of 
the Lights”), and straight up aggressive, old-school 
swagger rap (“Monster”). While his status as an 
underdog, both in the rap game and life in general, had 
always been a staple of his lyrical content, on Fantasy 
it took a darker, deeper tone. The world had held up a 
mirror and West had ?nally seen his re?ection, and he 
was man enough to admit that he didn’t like one bit 
of what he saw. But instead of letting the world defeat 
him, he channeled that energy to produce something 
that would make the world love him again.
And we did love him again, and Kanye heartily reaped 
the rewards. He released the victory-lap Watch the 
Throne with Jay-Z, designed bags for Louis Vuitton 
and shoes for Nike, and ?nally married his princess, 
Kim Kardashian. He’s got a family, and he seems 
genuinely happy and ful?lled by his creative pursuits 
outside of music — and that’s the problem. Beginning 
with 2013’s Yeezus, which was listenable when it came 
out but has now completely faded from the public 
consciousness, it seems clear we are in the “decline” 
period of Kanye’s career; the falling action in the 
Shakespearean drama that has been his life.
The two tracks that he’s released in anticipation of 
Waves, “Real Friends” and “No More Parties in L.A.,” 
don’t stand out in the rap game the same way his 
earlier stuff always did. While the beats are good, they 
don’t sound radically different from what anyone else 
in the genre is doing. While his ?ow is on point, his 
lyrical content is ?at and generic. Gone are the days 
of a young upstart raging against the system, his 
contemporaries whom he always saw as competitors, 
and most of all himself. Now he just raps about his 
lux life, how he’s got a hot wife and lots of money and 
how he’s basically the King. The life of a King isn’t 
interesting or engaging, that’s why it’s the Princes that 
control rap now, the Drakes and the Kendricks — the 
ones who are all competing to become the next Kanye. 
West is a lame duck, waiting for the next guy to be 
sworn in.
Kanye West has had a great career, one of the best 
in music history, and it’s no problem that he’s on the 
decline. Every artist reaches a creative peak — it’s 
part of the natural life cycle of the creative culture, 
and West has certainly left a sizeable mark on ours. Go 
look at Kanye West’s pro?le on your Spotify. I bet that 
you have more friends also listening to Kanye than any 
other artist. Everybody has at least one Kanye track 
they like, because he touched on virtually every genre 
that has been popular during his career.
So Waves will come out, and a lot of people will 
listen to it, and say that it’s “pretty good.” But then 
something else will come out and the public will move 
on and let Waves slip away from their Recently Played 
playlists. Out with the old, in with the new.
At the very least, Kanye will always have the best 
Twitter. #wizwearscoolpants

The works of Banksy, a London-based guerrilla street 
artist, have been both adored and criticized for some 
time now. Although Banksy’s real identity remains, for 
the most part, unknown, his art is strongly recognizable 
due to signature stenciling techniques and strong use of 
political epigrams in his work.
Beginning in the early nineties, Bansky emerged onto 
the art scene in London as a talented, freehand graf?ti 
artist. During the late nineties and early 2000’s, Banksy 
began implementing stenciled graf?ti art into his art 
pieces, which were now almost exclusively street art 
installations. Around the same time that Banksy began 
using stencils, his street art began to re?ect stronger 
political and ethical views and opinions. Much of his 
work, usually satirical in nature, eludes to an anti-
war, anti-hate, anti-capitalist movement. His work 
often times mocks centralized power and criticizes 
government authority for their role in the poverty, 
despair, and alienation of powerless individuals.
Because his work is primarily unprotected street 
art open to the public, many of his works have been 
concealed, stolen, or even destroyed. With Banksy’s 
strong political views so present in his work, it probably 
comes as little to no surprise that a great deal of his art 
has been destroyed or removed from its original location 
by government of?cials who ?nd the artwork offensive 
or inciting. A large amount of Banksy’s work over the 
last several years has speci?cally targeted and criticized 
of?cials in both the U.K. and France. This was exactly 
the case this past week, when government of?cials 
ordered that Banksy’s most recent work be removed from 
its original location.
The mural was painted across the street from the French 
Embassy in Knightsbridge, London on wooden panels 
of a developing construction site. The work featured 
the iconic image from Les Misérables — a young girl, 
Cosette, standing in front of the French national ?ag. In 
the mural, young Cosette is crying while she is overcome 
by teargas as the empty gas canister lie beside her. Off 
to the side of the mural was an interactive QR code, 
which onlookers of the mural could scan via their mobile 
phones. The QR code was linked to video footage of 
French police using teargas on refugees in a camp in 
Calais, France.
The Calais refugee camp has become known as “The 
Calais Jungle,” or simply “The Jungle,” due to its 
muddy, swampy, and rundown conditions. The Jungle 
is now home to over 6,000 refugees, many of which 
are orphaned children. A large number of migration 
attempts from The Jungle to the U.K. are reported 
every day. Government of?cials from both France and 
the U.K. have been criticized in the passed year for 
violent intervention methods they have taken to try and 
control the situations in the refugee camp. Banksy’s 
mural draws attention to and highly criticizes the cruel 
treatment of refugees in the Calais Refugee Camp, and 
focuses speci?cally on French police brutality and their 
alleged increase in use of teargas to control the refugees.
Attempts were made by the embassy to remove the 
mural within days of it being erected. Photographs 
taken of the mural before it was taken down reveal the 
damages to the wood, possibly by crowbars or hammers, 
which occurred during these apparent removal attempts. 
After failing to remove the wood on which the mural 
was painted, the embassy ordered that the mural be 
concealed from the public, because it was “slanderous” 
and “incited unnecessary anger from the public.” 
Onlookers watched and took photographs as a team of 
men boarded up the mural. Within the last several days, 
the boarding was allegedly taken down and the mural 
was revealed once again to the public. This happened 
several times over the course of three or so days, until 
the embassy inevitably ordered that the developers on 
the site remove the mural permanently.
This is not the ?rst time, and likely not the last, that 
Banksy’s work has criticized the treatment of refugees in 
Europe and elsewhere. The Les Mis mural is likely part 
of an ongoing series by Banksy that emphases unjust 
treatment of refugees speci?cally residing in The Jungle. 
He previously painted a mural of Steve Jobs outside the 
entrance to the camp, highlighting the fact that Steve 
Jobs, a brilliant and exceedingly successful individual, 
was son to two Syrians that immigrated to the United 
States.
New coverage of responses to the mural reported almost 
unanimous opinions by the public. Many onlookers 
hope that the striking image of France would tug at the 
heartstrings of those who hold the fate of the refugees in 
their hands. Others hoped that it would bring awareness 
for those suffering in the camps at the Calais Refugee 
Camp, and in refugee camps all over the world. In 
response to the mural being removed, many argued that 
the mural was covered because the French government 
is ashamed of what it has done, or that it likely has 
something to hide.
Many artists in the political street art movement share 
similar opinions. They believe that art should not only be 
enjoyed for what it is, but admired for what it is capable 
of. Art can be a powerful tool for sending a message 
during times of extreme anguish and despair. Art can be 
a means by which the public is exposed to the injustices 
brought unto them by the authority under which they 
reside. Art has an undeniable ability to become whatever 
we make it and it is my personal hope that artists like 
Banksy continue to use art as an avenue for change.

Bullet for My Valentine is a Welsh heavy metal band from Bridgend formed in 1998. 
The band has achieved signi?cant mainstream success, especially when compared 
to other heavy metal bands, with millions of record sales and two gold records in the 
U.S. alone. In anticipation for their U.S. Tour, which includes a date in Pittsburgh 
at Stage AE on Feb. 24, The Tartan got to sit down with lead vocalist for the band, 
Matt Tuck, and talk about the band’s history, music, and their newest album — 
Venom. Venom, which Tuck emphatically describes as the band’s best work, 
recently debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hard Rock charts.
Venom, in its sound, is perhaps the most intense Bullet for My Valentine album 
yet. Tuck, in large part, directed the sound of the album; I asked him about some 
of the experiences he drew from in crafting the songs on the album. One such 
experience he told me about was the song “You Want a Battle? Here’s a War.” The 
song re?ects his own upbringing in a way — the driving lead guitar and aggressive 
instrumentation set over a bombastic beat is reminiscent of Tuck’s time growing up 
in Wales, without anyone to rely on. “My teachers didn’t really get me. They tried to 
get me to abandon being in a band, but there just weren’t any other opportunities 
in the area. The band was who I was.” Tuck says he was picked on frequently for 
being in a band and liking metal music as a kid, and wanted to make a song that 
fans, both his age and younger, would identify with.
Another song that has some emotional signi?cance for Tuck is what he calls his 
favorite song of the album — the opening track “No Way Out.” The song, for Tuck, 
“is a great summary of where the band is, musically speaking, and where it wants 
to be. I love all of the different components of the song. The middle has a technical 
guitar-heavy piece for all the real guitarheads out there, the thrash of the verse is 
just pure energy. We really didn’t want to hold anything back or pull any punches.” 
The song certainly embodies the tone and musicality of the album. It also harkens 
back to Tuck’s childhood about his frustrations with not being able to express 
himself as people in his life seldom supported his avenues for ambition.
Finally, we talked about the titular track “Venom.” A departure from the aggressive 
tone midway through the album, “Venom” is best described as a brooding ballad, 
with more melodic singing in order to emphasize an emotional bent in the song. 
The song’s subject, about a harrowing love-hate relationship, is not one Tuck says 
strictly applies to him in his life, but a song that he still found immensely enjoyable 
to write. “It’s about being in a relationship with someone who is almost poisonous 
in the way they’re affecting you, which is why we named the track the way we 
did.” The song also speaks to the genre-bending capabilities of Tuck, who has 
named unlikely sources such as Bob Dylan as songwriting inspirations. “We just 
do what we do. People have a hard time categorizing us — some people say we’re 
metal-core, other people say we’re more on the hard rock side. We just make music, 
kept things simple and let the songs 
do the talking.” I think the willingness 
and adeptness with which Tuck crosses 
genres speaks to his skill as a songwriter 
and an artist. Not many metal bands are 
comfortable with putting a love song like 
“Venom” in their tracklist for fear of losing 
credibility, but Bullet for My Valentine’s 
unapologetic uniqueness is one of the 
main factors of their success.
I would personally recommend seeing 
Bullet for My Valentine at Stage AE on 
Feb. 24. Their tracklist always includes 
a good bit of improvisation for fans 
who want music beyond what they’ve 
heard before, and their live presence is 
always entertaining. The tracklist will 
be composed of approximately six songs 
from Venom, and eight fan favorites from 
older works. The raw energy present in 
Venom should lend itself to the band’s 
most bombastic concerts yet, de?nitely 
not something to miss for any metal fan 
out there.

My first encounter with Noodlehead was on a bitterly 
cold evening, and I was exhausted from a ridiculously 
long day of classes. I had half a mind to go home, but 
had promised a friend dinner and we soon found our-
selves lost in Shadyside, with a glitchy Google Maps as 
our guide. On the verge of freezing, we asked around for 
directions, and were fortunate enough to end our half-
hour trek with the warm glow that Noodlehead shed onto 
the dark, cold pavement outside.
We were welcomed in with smiles and seated at a table 
with a chair on one end, and a portion of a cushioned 
booth that lined the wall on the other. The room was lit 
up with a mellow buttery light that ebbed and flowed 
with the rustic decor, but was dark enough not to strain 
the eyes that were feasting on their simple single-sheet-
of-paper menus.
As a seasoned Thai food consumer, with a father who 
spent almost a decade living in Bangkok, I was immedi-
ately suspicious of a majority of the menu items before 
me. Most of the menu was Asian fusion, laden with 
hearty meat dishes and their tofu-substituted counter-
parts. As many Thai food lovers would do, I decided to 
test the grounds with a classic: Pad Thai. For appetiz-
ers, we ordered the Thai fried chicken and the pork belly 
steamed buns — a spin on the delicious, classic pork 
bao.
While we waited, indie music lulled in the background 
while the place began to fill up with the approaching din-
ner hour. Beach House’s “Apple Orchard” queued in as 
we encountered the thai fried chicken. I was pleasantly 
surprised by the larger-than-expected portion sizes, and 
the lightly seasoned crunch that the chicken carried with 
it from the kitchen. The dish was accompanied with a 
flavorful dipping sauce, and was in itself quite filling. The 
real heroes of the night, however, were those pork belly 
steamed buns. They were delicately flavored to create 
a fusion of savory and sweet, which was well contained 
within the lightly baked buns the meat was folded into. 
We split the four that came on the plate, two each, and 
were both craving more long after our last bite.
As for the Pad Thai, I was impressed. Unlike many res-
taurants in the area, Noodlehead kept its flavors more 
on the traditional side than the Americanized side. The 
peanuts were accents and not at all overwhelming. As 
is with all great Thai food, there was a beautiful edge of 
smoky sweetness that played about my tongue. I’m not 
the biggest fan of spicy food, so I went for a level of two, 
and was blown away with the simultaneous subtlety 
and necessity of the spice in the dish. I wasn’t reaching 
for water all night, but I did feel the heat. It was well-
balanced and flavorful, just as one would hope for from a 
two.
I have since returned to Noodlehead and ordered the 
Chiang Mai Curry Bowl, which was too big for me to fin-
ish in one night after stuffing my face with my beloved 
pork belly buns, but was the perfect dish for a cold day. It 
warmed me up from the inside, and the flavors were rich 
and the spice just as satisfying as it had been with the 
Pad Thai. The noodles started out on the crunchier side, 
but once the dish was mixed together, it was absolutely 
phenomenal.
Heads Up
They like their crispy greens: This place is CASH ONLY. 
As has become the norm with the artsy, urban, uber cool 
restaurant culture that has taken Pittsburgh by storm, 
Noodlehead insists on a cash-only policy, so if you do plan 
to eat here, be prepared. That being said, given the portion 
sizes, I would say that the prices are very reasonable, espe-
cially if you’re planning on splitting appetizers with friends.
Meat, glorious meat: There are NOT a whole lot of veg-
etarian mains here, although there are tofu options for most 
items on the menu. If you are a strict vegetarian, I would 
be wary and definitely check with the waiters to see if they 
use any sort of meat stock in their curries and sauces that 
may make the tofu substitution obsolete. There are some 
lovely vegetarian starters, though, if you like snacking as 
much as I do.
Are we there yet?: Best way to get to Noodlehead by bus 
from main campus is to hike up to 5th and Morewood and 
take the 71B down to Highland Ave at Alder St. I do think 
ubering there is faster, and walking there in this weather is 
miserable.
Click, click: This place has a lovely website, that shares its 
aesthetic appeal with the restaurant itself. Check it out for 
timings, menu specifics, and the like. http://noodlehead-
pgh.com/
For those stay-at-home days: Unfortunately the place 
does not have a telephone, so if you would like to get take 
out or order straight from the venue, you will need to arrive 
in person to place the order and take it home yourself.
Hours: Noon–10 p.m. daily, except on holidays (see web-
site).
21+: This place is BYOB, but does charge a 50 cent per 
person recycling fee (which means they take care of the 
bottle for you, SCORE).
Rash Alert: As stated on their website, their dishes may 
contain nuts, shellfish, gluten, and soy products. Be sure to 
let the waiters know if you have any specific food allergies 
and they should be able to help you make a choice that will 
not get your immune system riled up.
Ambiance: Fabulous, very relaxed.
College student friendly?: Absolutely, I’ve run into many 
a Carnegie Mellon student at Noodlehead. One thing I do 
appreciate is that the restaurant is not only a hub for col-
lege students, so you get a nice mixture in seating neigh-
bors and don’t have to worry about whispering about that 
guy in your calculus class that keeps clicking his pen too 
loudly.

Row House: Far more than just a cinema, this place is a community 
Situated on Lawrenceville’s Main Street, Row House 
Cinema is a one-screen theater that has been screening a 
delightfully quirky range of films since it opened in June 
2014.
“Who wouldn’t want to own a theater?” said Brian 
Mendelssohn, owner and curator of Row House Cinema. 
Mendelssohn has been showing movies now for almost 
two years, but has been a film-lover his entire life. 
Recalling conversations about film with his brother and 
friends, Mendelssohn says his goal with Row House is to 
continue the conversation with a larger audience.
The theater, while hidden away, is unexpectedly inviting. 
One of Mendelssohn’s goals is to educate and introduce 
people to films and film movements that they never would 
have considered by packaging diverse pictures into week-
long themed events. For example, “French vs Hong Kong 
New Wave” week featured Made in the U.S.A. and Le 
Cercle Rouge, as well as Fallen Angels and The Killer. 
This lesson in how film movements happen differently 
across cultures and countries was something that many 
casual moviegoers would have never known without Row 
House making it accessible. These themed weeks can 
also take a lighter tone. For instance, “Tight Pants Week” 
is coming up. While many people enjoy tight pants, not a 
whole lot of them have seen David Bowie grace the silver 
screen in Labyrinth. What a shame, right?
The first thing to know about Row House is that anything 
goes when it comes to showing films. Expect the old clas-
sics, foreign films, and highly acclaimed — but also be 
ready for some newer titles, ironic callbacks, and cult clas-
sics. The owner and staff curate based on their own gamut 
of experience with film and hope to soon incorporate the 
community in curation as part of a membership program.
In addition to film itself, community involvement is a huge 
part of Row House’s mission. At one point, an enthusiastic 
couple went to see The Princess Bride and walked into the 
theater wearing full costumes. Mendelssohn’s response? 
Free tickets! The discount for costumes is now a fixture of 
their ticketing. By listening and responding to their audi-
ences, Row House is becoming a familiar and friendly face 
in the Lawrenceville community. With this community 
backing, the small cinema is beginning to establish their 
own rules for what a theater can be.
One of Mendelssohn’s crusades draws inspiration from 
The Rocky Horror Picture Show’s intense cult-following. 
He mentions that he always wished there were a similar 
tradition among fans of a better quality film. So, he began 
“Coconut Night” by offering patrons a reduced price to see 
Monty Python and the Holy Grail so long as they bring a 
pair of coconuts. The Row House crew was amazed by the 
response (and amused by the theater full of coconuts) and 
decided to make the night a quarterly tradition.
Patrons are also encouraged to engage with cinema, and 
the community, at a variety of events including a costume 
contest for the aforementioned Labyrinth. They enjoy part-
nering with small business and cultural organizations to 
bring interesting food, music, or speakers relevant to the 
theme of the week. Sprinkled throughout each week are 
specialty screenings for children/families, beer tastings 
with their neighbors, Atlas Brew Works, Q&A’s with the 
directors or producers, karaoke nights, and RiffTrax com-
mentary. This last idea is one that Mendelssohn is a huge 
fan of. The idea came from wanting to host a “Vampire 
Week” featuring What We Do In The Shadows and The 
Lost Boys. At the same time, the crew didn’t want to 
snub one of the more publicized vampire movies of late, 
Twilight. Due to Mendelssohn’s inability to screen this film 
straight “on principle,” RiffTrax’s snarky commentary, cre-
ated by the comedians of Mystery Science Theater 3000, 
was added to Row House’s diverse offerings. They plan to 
use this commentary again on the upcoming Row House 
screenings.
As the popularity of streaming services has grown, 
the way we view movies is evolving. The classic linear 
timeline of film releases from post-production to home 
entertainment no longer has to include going to the the-
ater. There are new films and series made exclusively for 
streaming providers where TV networks and theaters are 
not involved at all. It raises the questions: Why go to the 
movies? What’s the point? Lawrenceville’s answer is Row 
House Cinema.
In short, Row House is more than just a theater. It’s a place 
that fulfills the social aspect of film that everyone seeks, 
whether they be film buffs or casual moviegoers.

After seven years of bruising political debates, The Big 
Short ?nally managed to ?t the real story of the 2008 
?nancial crisis into a two hour window, allowing many 
Americans to ?nally understand the mechanics of the Wall 
Street greed that so thoroughly destroyed the economy at 
the end of the previous decade.
The movie does an excellent job informing the viewer on 
the ?nancial crisis. The celebrity cameos that explained 
some of the more obscure jargon used to describe Wall 
Street’s activities in the mid-2000s make the movie a 
crystal-clear and accurate portrayal of the ?nancial crisis. 
However, when screenwriter Adam McKay stops drawing 
on the source material of Michael Lewis’s book of the 
same title, and begins to form his political message, it 
almost feels as if he forgot what the movie is about. He 
makes a number of policy prescriptions which have 
very little to do with what was actually depicted and the 
movie ends up only muddling the conversation its source 
material so valiantly fought to clarify.
Most of the movie does a great job of accurately 
identifying some of the truly irredeemable characters 
in the ?nancial crisis. An agent from the credit agency 
Standard and Poor’s explains that they just give away 
unwarranted AAA ratings (the highest possible) to 
prevent bankers from getting their assets rated higher 
down the block at Moody’s. These in?ated ratings boosted 
investor con?dence at a time when investors should 
have been getting nervous, causing the mania behind 
the housing bubble to spread without impedance. Steve 
Carell’s Mark Baum sits at a table with the smarmiest 
individual who tells him that he is the one in charge 
of making sure investors are not defrauded by Merrill 
Lynch’s investments, but he’s on Merrill Lynch’s payroll 
and has no stake in making sure the investments go well. 
Arrangements like this are what allowed the ?nancial 
contagion to spread so quickly and virulently. Without 
mentioning the concept of leverage, which might have 
just been throwing too much jargon at viewers, there is 
even some discussion of how the reason the bubble burst 
so violently was due to how much borrowed money was 
used to purchase the shaky assets, getting at the heart 
of the problem. However, as well as McKay does stoking 
accurate anger, he throws it all away in the ?nal seconds.
The scene that really made this movie leave a bitter taste 
in my mouth came right at the end, as Baum sits on a 
deck telling his coworker that Wall Street is about to be 
bailed out. He tells his coworker that the rest of Wall Street 
wasn’t stupid; they just knew that if something went 
wrong the taxpayers would be there to foot the bill. This is 
a very common bit of rhetoric surrounding Wall Street, but 
literally seconds before this scene, we witness massive 
quantities of people, most of them crying, carrying their 
belongings in boxes. It’s hard to watch as one woman 
drops her cardboard box and struggles to repack it among 
the masses of newly unemployed exiting Merrill Lynch. To 
make everything worse, that pseudo-consumer protection 
individual from earlier in the movie is there telling people 
to “go straight to your transportation and do not talk to the 
press.” Those jobless bankers were certainly a part of the 
mania, and they had no reason to expect a government 
bailout. Yes, after the fact, it’s easier to realize that the 
total of nearly (deep breaths) eight trillion dollars spent by 
the Federal Reserve to bail out the banks was a little too 
much. The reports of bonuses being paid to remaining 
executives from the excess were infuriating. However, 
much of the TARP program that Baum was referring to — 
along with the rest of the expenses the government paid 
— were engineered buyouts that prevented the Great 
Recession from becoming the second Great Depression.
McKay then uses discussions of the bailout to leap into a 
bizarre discussion of the events that unfurled in response 
to the ?nancial crisis. He starts with one of the most 
uncontroversial points many make about the ?nancial 
crisis — a huge number of people broke the law and 
exactly one went to prison. I’ve always been disturbed by 
the retributive nature of this argument (full disclosure, I 
think we should probably rethink criminal justice entirely 
and abolish prisons, but that’s another thing entirely), but 
in a world where people who commit minor, inoffensive 
crimes like smoking a joint see prison cells, people who 
commit massive scale fraud probably deserve some 
jail time, too. Further, McKay scathingly and correctly 
condemns the strain of virulent racism and elitism that 
followed the crisis that blames immigrants and poor 
people for stealing jobs and being lazy rather than the 
brutal mistakes of Wall Street employees. However, his 
message continues into an area that doesn’t really make 
sense. His next two calls are that Congress needs to break 
up the big banks, and that it failed to pass meaningful 
Wall Street regulation.
The ?rst claim is false. Breaking up the big banks is not 
good for stability. The reason that this crisis was not the 
end of the western economy was that Chase, Bank of 
America, and Wells Fargo were aided by the government 
in swallowing up failing banks that had so much of 
America’s money with them. These giant banks that are 
able to survive losses are plenty enough to be competitive 
(ten major American banks is a less concentrated system 
than any other ?nancial industry on Earth and also less 
concentrated than most other American industries), but 
also provide an anchor if banks begin to fail. Yes, the 
taxpayers could ?nd themselves on the hook if we were 
about to lose Bank of America, but we were never about 
to lose Bank of America. When a large number of smaller 
banks crashed in the late 1920s, we had a much more 
intense economic meltdown that culminated in a nuclear 
attack on another country. Even if one individual bank 
isn’t too big to fail, the industry is. However, big, resilient 
banks mean that the government has an avenue to stop 
the bleeding if the worst happens.
The second claim, that banks avoided regulation, is 
revisionist history. The problem in 2008 was massive 
overleveraging. Dodd-Frank, the 2010 banking reform bill, 
aimed very speci?cally at leveraging, including capital 
requirements that made it so banks could never be in 
debt they couldn’t get out of. Dodd-Frank made the cost 
of being an overleveraged threat to the economy really 
high, and banks are naturally downsizing without causing 
a sudden hiccup in the market. This is a much safer and 
more stable banking system than we had eight years 
ago. There may be crises in the future, simply because 
there are so many things that can go wrong and we 
probably don’t even know what half of them are. However, 
overleveraging is not likely to be a problem again for a 
very long time.
The fact that the movie stops telling its own story and 
hops on with a populist agenda is not only jarring, but it’s 
a legitimate plot hole to the point where it just ruined the 
movie. The link between the proposed policies and the 
crisis, a link that’s not entirely obvious, is never explained 
— which is too bad, because the movie had done such an 
incredible job of explaining up to that point.
I’m generally a huge fan of movies that are blatant and 
preachy with their messages even when I don’t agree, but 
the disparity between this movie and its stated message 
is so unsettling. I advise Adam McKay to watch his own 
?lm. It’s honestly a great time. Just make sure you’re 
watching the movie adaptation of Michael Lewis’s book 
and not the Adam McKay original commentary sloppily 
tacked on at the end.
