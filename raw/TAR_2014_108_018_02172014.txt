Professors share life lessons in Mortar Board lecture
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
News Co-Editor
“Don’t drink the yellow 
vodka” was one of many les-
sons distilled during “The 
Moral of the Story: Life Les-
sons from Professors,” a lec-
ture presented by the senior 
honor society Mortar Board, 
last Thursday.
The lecture, which ?lled 
McConomy Auditorium to 
capacity, consisted of talks 
by four professors, including 
Rebecca Nugent, associate 
teaching professor in the de-
partment of statistics; David 
Kosbie, assistant teaching pro-
fessor in the School of Com-
puter Science; John Mackey, 
teaching professor and asso-
ciate department head of the 
department of mathematical 
sciences; and Robert F. Culb-
ertson, adjunct assistant pro-
fessor of entrepreneurship in 
the Tepper School of Business.
Each professor talked 
about the lessons they learned 
throughout their life that they 
thought would be most valu-
able to Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents. Nugent, who won the 
2012–13 Elliott Dunlap Smith 
Award for Teaching and Edu-
cational Service, presented 
by the Dietrich College of Hu-
manities & Social Sciences, 
called her talk “Life Advice 
and Wisdom ... Or, Don’t Do 
What I Did.” Nugent broke her 
life up into discrete lessons, 
like “don’t drink the yellow 
vodka,” an adage Nugent drew 
from a trip to Antarctica.
In Antarctica, Nugent said, 
the researchers they visited 
had distilled their own dubi-
ous, yellow-colored vodka af-
ter running out of what they 
had brought with them. “He 
took the shot, as I watched his 
brain cells melt out of his ears, 
I realized ‘don’t drink the yel-
low vodka.’ ”
“For two to three weeks we 
knew nothing of what hap-
pened in the world,” Nugent 
said. “You realized how much 
noise there is all the time, 
and you’re just quiet for a few 
weeks,” she added. “If you let 
yourself be overloaded, just go 
be silent. That’s what I learned 
on the Antarctica trip.”
Vaasavi Unnava, a ?rst-
year economics and statistics 
major, said that Nugent’s proc-
lamation that the decisions 
students make now don’t have 
as much clout as they think 
they will struck her the hard-
est. “I really took that away be-
cause I think that a lot of the 
time, especially students at 
CMU tend to make decisions 
thinking, ‘Oh how will this 
impact my future? This will be 
so crazy. I’m going to end up 
completely in the wrong place 
because of this,’ ” Unnava said. 
“But making decisions for just 
yourself right now is a really 
amazing thing.”

Carnegie Mellon announces partnership with Yahoo, Inc. 
ALVIN MATHEW
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon and Ya-
hoo, Inc. recently announced 
a ?ve-year partnership worth 
$10 million. The partnership, 
named Project InMind, will 
allow researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon to use Yahoo’s data 
services collection, giving 
them an opportunity to “test 
new ways that machine learn-
ing and interface technolo-
gies can improve personalized 
user experiences,” according 
to the of?cial press release.
Project InMind will allow 
Yahoo and Carnegie Mellon 
researchers and students to 
develop new methods that 
will improve machine intel-
ligence and the personaliza-
tion of smartphone applica-
tions, among other things. It 
will allow researchers to use 
algorithms and analyze them 
to determine what consumers 
need and want. Carnegie Mel-
lon students and community 
members will even be able to 
use some of the company’s ex-
perimental mobile software, 
which will allow researchers 
to access more data and make 
swift improvements to exist-
ing technolgies.
“We’re thrilled to be part-
nering with the exceptional 
faculty and students at Carn-
egie Mellon, which has estab-
lished itself as a premier insti-
tution for machine learning 
and user interface technolo-
gies,” said Ron Brachman, 
chief scientist of Yahoo and 
head of Yahoo labs, in a press 
release.
“By creating a way for 
Carnegie Mellon University 
researchers to work directly 
with Yahoo software and 
infrastructure, we hope to 
speed up the pace of mobile 
and personalization research 
and create a better user expe-
rience,” Brachman continued. 
Project InMind will also 
include a fellowship program 
— funded by Yahoo — at 
Carnegie Mellon that will pro-
vide both monetary and re-
search support to members of 
the university’s computer sci-
ence community. Individuals 
in the fellowship program will 
be given the opportunity to 
research ?elds like “machine 
learning, mobile technolo-
gies, human-computer inter-
action, personalization, novel 
interaction techniques, and 
natural language processing,” 
according to the press release. 
Under the terms of the 
partnership, the university 
will have ownership over all 
intellectual property created 
through it, but Yahoo will be 
given ownership of anything 
developed with the company 
and will be able to license 
property owned by Carnegie 
Mellon.
“This is a one-of-a-kind 
opportunity for our students 
and faculty to work directly 
with a team of leading-edge 
researchers from Yahoo Labs 
on technologies that could 
bene?t hundreds of millions 
Suresh sprouts ProSeed initiative
BRENT HEARD
Contributing Editor
Last Wedensday, Universi-
ty President Subra Suresh an-
nounced the creation of the 
ProSEED program by email.
The email described Pro-
SEED as “intended to create 
new mechanisms for con-
necting and coordinating 
other seed-funding programs 
available at CMU, so that 
our community can be bet-
ter positioned to apply for 
sustained support for their 
ideas.”
Seed funding is the money 
provided by an organization 
to a group working to devel-
op a novel product for future 
use or commercialization, to 
help with product develop-
ment, prototyping, testing, 
and marketing.
ProSEED addresses one of 
President Suresh’s ?ve theme 
areas that he identi?ed ear-
lier in the academic year as 
part of his listening tour of 
campus. 
ProSEED responds to 
Suresh’s identi?ed need to 
increase the seed funding for 
new ideas, which according 
to Carnegie Mellon’s leader-
ship webpage, “is especially 
critical in light of the budget 
uncertainties and attendant 
delays associated with gov-
ernment funding.”
The webpage states from 
Oct. 1, “[Suresh] will soon be 
announcing new models and 
mechanisms for seed funding 
that will leverage resources 
from a number of on-campus 
stakeholders and external 
sources,” the culmination 
of which is the ProSEED 
program.
Vice Provost for Educa-
tion Amy Burkert character-
ized ProSEED as an umbrella 
containing seed funding 
programs such as the Simon 
Initiative Seed Grants and 
Crosswalk, and others in the 
future.
Burkert said that ProSEED 
is “meant to seed new ideas, 
new initiatives, to bring to-
gether various parts of cam-
pus, various opportunities to 
really be synergistic.”
The Simon Initiative is 
providing seed money for 
“faculty to develop technol-
ogy-enhanced courses or 
course modules, or other re-
search projects that use data-
driven learning technolo-
gies,” according to President 
Suresh’s email. 
The administration of this 
program will be conducted 
through The Eberly Center 
for Teaching Excellence and 
Educational Innovation. 
Burkert clari?ed that the 
program has two key focuses 
of learning and application-
based developments and 
more research-oriented ones.
According to the email, 
Crosswalk will provide fund-
ing to “empower ideas for 
new connections and collab-
orations across campus, on 
any number of dimensions.” 
Crosswalk money will be 
used to improve the student 
and campus experience and 
will focus on the domains of 
student research, quality of 
life, courses, student compe-
titions, community service 
learning, and symposiums 
and strategic workshops.

A Facebook group called 
“To Dining, With Love” that 
allows Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents to voice concerns or 
complaints to CulinArt has 
gained ground, especially 
among ?rst-year students. 
The group, hosted by Stu-
dent Dormitory Coun-
cil’s Housing and Dining 
Committee now has 803 
members.
The group advertises it-
self on the page as a place 
to “talk about what dining 
does right and what it does 
wrong” and a place to “pitch 
ideas you think [dining ser-
vices] should try out.”
Dan Evans, Student Dor-
mitory Council Housing 
and Dining Services repre-
sentative and ?rst-year biol-
ogy major, answers many of 
the concerns voiced by stu-
dents. According to Evans, 
the idea for the Facebook 
page came from president 
of the Housing and Dining 
Services Committee and se-
nior computer science ma-
jor Milan Desai. Knowing 
that many students have 
strong opinions about the 
dining system, the Com-
mittee wanted to facilitate 
conversation between ven-
dors and students. As Evans 
explained, the committee 
“trusted the student body 
to post reasonable requests, 
and for the most part that 
has been the case.”
Housing and Dining 
Services hosts a meeting 
at the Residence on Fifth 
once a month during which 
representatives from the 
Housing and Dining Ser-
vices Committee have the 
opportunity to learn about 
new dining initiatives and 
receive student feedback. 
Suggestions posted on the 
Facebook group are now 
brought to these dinners as 
well.
Although the Facebook 
group is still less than a 
month old, changes sug-
gested in the group have 
already been instituted. 
After students requested 
that napkins be more read-
ily available in the Schatz 
Dining Room, the changes 
were implemented, and 
there are now napkins on 
every table.
Larger issues, like that 
of the block system, which 
many students consider to 
be expensive and inconve-
nient, will take longer to 
address. “The problem with 
some of these requests is 
that it takes time,” Evans 
said. “We are not going to 
be able to change the meal

The MOSAIC program, 
with the Of?ce of Student Life 
and the Program for Deliber-
ative Democracy, will hold an 
event at the university called 
“After Roe ... A Discussion of 
Reproductive Rights” next 
Sunday in Rangos Hall.
According to a university 
press release, the event will 
provide students with an op-
portunity to learn “about 
the history of sexuality and 
choice laws; medical facts 
pertaining to abortions; reli-
gious and philosophical per-
spectives; case studies; and 
more” from experts in the 
region. Students will be given 
the opportunity to analyze 
the issue from the vantage 
point of federal, state, and 
campus principles.
Robert Cavalier, teaching 
professor of philosophy and 
director of the Program for 
Deliberative Democracy, said 
in the press release, “The is-
sue of abortion in America is 
far more complex than the 
rhetoric of picket lines and 
sound bites. Through the 
Campus Conversation, we 
hope to show that citizens 
can indeed engage in these 
kinds of discussions of public 
policy and to do so in a civil 
way.”
MOSAIC, an annual gen-
der conference held at Carn-
egie Mellon and led by stu-
dents, faculty, and staff at 
the university, aims to “offer 
provocative sessions aimed 
at exploring gender construc-
tion, commonalities between 
and among genders, and fos-
tering intentional dialogue 
around unconventional gen-
der-based topics,” according 
to the press release. Students 
can register through student 
life for the event, which is 
free and open to all.

of mobile users,” said Randall 
E. Bryant, dean of the School 
of Computer Science, in the 
press release. “The overall 
commitment in this new part-
nership is a testament to our 
shared desire to advance the 
science of machine learning, 
user interfaces, and mobile 
technologies.”
Student reaction to the 
partnership is mixed. Alex 
Tsai, a ?rst-year information 
systems major, said, “Despite 
being overshadowed by com-
panies like Google, Yahoo is 
still a big player in the tech 
industry. For example, they 
just acquired Tumblr. The ar-
eas they propose to collabo-
rate with CMU on, such as 
personalized user experience 
and machine learning, are 
both trending and have a lot 
of potential. My only concern 
is that project InMind seems 
to be only for [computer sci-
ence] majors, and CMU is too 
interdisciplinary for that.”
Steven Wang, a sopho-
more economics and statis-
tics major, said, “it will be 
interesting to see what Yahoo 
hopes to gain from this part-
nership. How do they hope 
to bene?t from the ?ndings 
of CMU professors and stu-
dents, as well as the increased 
exposure of the company at 
CMU? The partnership obvi-
ously has great implications 
for research here but I would 
love to hear more about Ya-
hoo’s motivations.”

Undergraduate Education 
Stephanie Wallach said, “what 
President Suresh has discov-
ered is there’s a tremendous 
amount of interest from un-
dergraduates in terms of more 
opportunities for interdisci-
plinary research. More ways 
to ?nd different avenues into 
the same question.”
Crosswalk will be run par-
allel to the existing Small Un-
dergraduate Research Grant 
(SURG) program offered by 
the Undergraduate Research 
Of?ce (URO), where students 
engaging in interdisciplinary 
research can ?ll out an extra 
application portion to apply 
for Crosswalk. 
In this way, the URO hopes, 
as Wallach described, “to 
strengthen an already robust 
program and highlight even 
more directly the interdisci-
plinary nature of the work 
we do here, and also provide 
some additional resources to 
students who ?nd that the 
funding may not be adequate.”
Crosswalk will also be in-
tegrated into the Meeting of 
the Minds presentations cur-
rently linked with the SURG 
program. 
“There will be a lot of inter-
play between these programs 
as they develop,” Burkert ex-
plained.
There are also plans for the 
ProSEED webpage to become 
a resource.
“If you look at the ProSEED 
website, there are also other 
types of seed funding avail-
able across campus,” Burkert 
explained, saying that there 
are plans to turn the website 
into a “collecting site” for seed 
opportunities across campus 
with a denotation if the oppor-
tunity is for students, alumni, 
or faculty.
Justine Cassell, one of the 
co-directors of The Simon Ini-
tiative, spoke about the role 
that the initiative will play in 
ProSEED.
“Our goal is to ensure that 
technology is used in places 
where it can improve learn-
ing gains,” Cassell described, 
noting The Simon Initiative’s 
funding for both the use of ex-
isting technology in the class-
room, but also for researching 
technology for classroom use. 
“This can be technology of any 
kind,” she added.
Cassell spoke of the neces-
sity of using technology in 
classrooms in a way that best 
promotes learning, and not 
just integrating technology 
because it is available. 
“This is a way of helping 
faculty and students focus on 
how technology can best help 
students to learn,” Cassell said.
In regard to ProSEED’s 
overall success, Burkert said, 
“I think a measure of success 
will be seeing whether this is 
effective in cross-fertilization.”
Wallach added, “I also 
think that you would have a 
much broader base of students 
who would have this oppor-
tunity [for undergraduate re-
search] before they graduate. 
It would be a more natural and 
accepted way that you engage 
when you’re an undergradu-
ate here.”
University announces seed-funding program ProSEED 
plan in two weeks … it could 
take a semester, it could take 
two.”
Evans noted that he too 
has done the math on the 
block system. A block pur-
chased on a meal plan costs 
about $11. Evans agreed 
with students: “A block does 
end up being more expensive 
than the sum of its parts.”
 Under the block system, 
a salad from Spinning Salad 
with edamame costs a stu-
dent just as much as the 
all-you-can-eat buffet in the 
Schatz Dining Room. Blocks 
are a pro?table system for 
vendors. As Evans points 
out, “Vendors make more 
money off blocks than when 
students use Dinex or cash. 
That’s where they are really 
bringing home the bacon. No 
pun intended.”
Other students are less 
critical. Fine arts ?rst-year 
Kira Melville said, “The block 
system does have its merits. 
It’s helpful for students who 
don’t know how to manage 
money. It works for students 
who don’t care about eating 
healthy.”
First-year electrical and 
computer engineering ma-
jor Maya Lassiter takes issue 
with the block system’s in-
compatibility with allergies. 
“It’s ridiculous that dining 
services requires students 
with speci?c dietary needs 
to pay more for food substi-
tutions on a block,” Lassiter 
said. “I hope that the Face-
book group gives students 
with special dietary needs a 
larger voice on campus.”
As for the complaints from 
students regarding excessive 
CulinArt advertising on the 
page itself, Evans says the is-
sue has been resolved. There 
was a “misunderstanding 
between CulinArt and what 
they though was an appro-
priate amount of advertis-
ing and what the Housing 
and Dining Committee had 
envisioned.” CulinArt will 
now only respond directly 
to students’ comments and 
questions.
Evans and the Housing 
and Dining Committee hope 
that the group will eventu-
ally run itself with direct par-
ticipation from CulinArt and 
other vendors on campus. 
Evans said, “We want to get 
[the] number [of members] 
up. We want to get as many 
people involved as possible. 
We want to get as many opin-
ions as possible.”
Upon ?rst receiving the 
invite, many students, includ-
ing ?rst-year electrical and 
computing engineering stu-
dent Aaron Perley, thought 
the Facebook group was “just 
a place to complain unpro-
ductively about the dining 
system.” 
Still other students in the 
group took offense at the on-
slaught of promotional mate-
rial from CulinArt. As ?rst-
year mechanical engineering 
major Sebastian Murati, ex-
plained, “It was irritating to 
see CulinArt monopolize the 
page and make what should 
have been a helpful conversa-
tion into another forum for 
advertising.”
Unity crucial to progress, Kosbie says
Excellence in Computer Sci-
ence, presented by the School 
of Computer Science, similarly 
broke his life into chunks that 
demonstrated times when he 
learned lessons that he want-
ed to pass on to Carnegie Mel-
lon students.
Kosbie began with the sto-
ry of a student who completed 
his class, 15-112: Fundamen-
tals of Programming and Com-
puter Science, while undergo-
ing treatment for cancer.
After the student passed 
away from cancer, Kosbie was 
torn about whether or not to 
take time from his busy sched-
ule to attend the funeral in 
Baltimore. 
Kosbie made the drive, 
however, and was the only 
Carnegie Mellon staff mem-
ber there.
“When you know — when 
your gut is telling you — what 
to do, just do it,” Kosbie said 
regarding the experience.
Kosbie also made points 
similar to Nugent’s about the 
choices students make im-
pacting their future.
“You really don’t know at 
this stage of life where you’re 
going,” said Kosbie, who origi-
nally began his career at Har-
vard University as a pre-med 
student, but now teaches com-
puter science.
Nkindé Ambalo, a ?rst year 
electrical and computer en-
gineering major, said that he 
was struck by how much one’s 
life can change during and af-
ter college. 
“We are pretty much all on 
this crazy path, so you don’t 
know what you’re going to 
do — none of [the speakers] 
knew what they were going 
to do,” Ambalo said. “Most of 
them started out doing some-
thing that was completely un-
related to what they do now 
— not even just teaching but 
their ?eld itself.... It was really 
interesting to see how they 
started out doing one thing, 
then had these enormous 
changes, before and after 
college.”
The next speaker, Mackey, 
told what was essentially the 
story of his life — how he 
ended up earning his Ph.D. 
at the University of Hawaii, 
and how, as a white male, he 
experienced the other side of 
prejudice at the hands of Ha-
waiian natives.
According to Mackey, this 
experience gave him valuable 
perspective.
“When you vary your expe-
riences, you will go through 
different stages and you will 
?nd yourself,” Mackey said, 
linking this point to Carnegie 
Mellon student life by saying 
that students too often break 
into cliques and factions rath-
er than forming a cohesive 
body.
The last speaker was Culb-
ertson (CIT ‘73, GSIA ‘74 , CIT 
‘75), who received his bach-
elor’s degree and two mas-
ter’s degrees from Carnegie 
Mellon.
Culbertson’s lecture fo-
cused on what he considered 
the most important lesson he 
had learned throughout life, 
“Do something even if it’s 
wrong.”
Culbertson also focused on 
some of the important men-
tors he had throughout his 
life, especially at Carnegie 
Mellon. “Great teachers cause 
you to have conversations 
you never wanted to have, 
make you do things you never 
wanted to do, and bring you to 
places you never thought you 
would go,” Culbertson said.
“The Moral of the Story: 
Life Lessons from Professors,” 
was presented by the Carn-
egie Mellon Mortar Board, a 
branch of the National College 
Senior Honor Society. 
According to Carnegie 
Mellon Mortar Board’s web-
site, “Mortar Board members 
are not only recognized as 
the top scholars and leaders 
on their campuses, but are 
selected based on dedication 
to scholarship, leadership, 
and service to the campus and 
Pittsburgh community.”

Have you ever seen pud-
dles on the road while driving 
only to see them disappear 
moments later? Have you ever 
seen a sun on the horizon that 
looked like it was both rising 
and setting? These seemingly 
impossible occurrences are 
actually the result of a phe-
nomenon known as a mirage. 
Mirages are caused by atmo-
spheric conditions and con-
tain at least one inverted im-
age of an object.
Generally, mirages are the 
result of refraction. Refrac-
tion occurs when a light wave 
crosses the boundary between 
two mediums at an angle. Part 
of the light wave will speed up 
or slow down before the rest 
of the wave. This change in 
speed causes the light wave to 
change direction or bend.
In the case of mirages, 
two different mediums are 
formed by a distinct, sud-
den change in air density in 
the atmosphere, according to 
howstuffworks.com. The most 
common cause of varying air 
density is varying air tempera-
ture, since hot air is less dense 
than cold air. One example of 
this temperature difference 
involves an asphalt road on a 
hot day. The asphalt, after sit-
ting in the sun for an extended 
period of time, heats the air 
directly above it to a higher 
temperature than the rest of 
the air in the atmosphere. The 
change in density between 
the hot air near the road and 
the cooler air higher in the at-
mosphere causes light rays to 
bend as they move between 
the mediums.
This bending of light 
causes mirages by affecting 
the way in which our eyes per-
ceive the light re?ecting off an 
object. 
Normally, light only trav-
els in a straight line. The 
light bouncing off an object 
re?ects in all directions. Your 
eyes perceive the light that 
bounces off the object straight 
toward you, and you see the 
object. When light wave bend-
ing occurs, however, your eyes 
detect additional light waves. 
Light still bounces off the ob-
ject in all directions, so you 
still detect light waves that re-
?ect straight toward you, and 
you still see the object. How-
ever, your eyes can also detect 
bent light waves, which cause 
you to see a mirror image of 
the object. 
In the instance of a mirror 
image of a car on a highway, 
the light waves that would 
normally simply re?ect to-
ward the ground hit the hot 
layer of air near the asphalt 
and are bent upward to-
ward your eyes. According to 
howstuffworks.com, the light 
waves re?ected by the bot-
tom of the car hit the hot air 
?rst, speed up, and are bent 
farther upward than the light 
waves re?ected from the top 
of the car. Because the lower 
light waves are bent farther 
upward, your eyes perceive 
the lower part of the car to be 
above the top of the car. This 
phenomenon causes your eyes 
to see both the original car 
and a mirror re?ection of the 
car below the original. To a 
viewer, this type of mirage of-
ten looks like a puddle of wa-
ter, since it re?ects everything 
located above it.
Since the mirror image in 
the previous example is below 
the horizon, the mirage is la-
beled as an inferior mirage. 
Mirages can also be superior 
mirages, which form above 
the horizon. Superior mirages 
typically occur when there is 
cold air underneath warm air. 
Superior mirages occur in the 
same way as inferior mirages, 
except that the light is bent in 
the opposite direction, which 
causes the ?ipped image to 
appear on top of the original 
image, instead of underneath.
Mirages, despite their rep-
utation as highly irrational 
visions, are the result of the 
simple, physical concept of 
light refraction and can lead 
to a variety of different illu-
sions and produce complex 
re?ections apparent in every-
day life.

Hands and ?ngers are some 
of the most useful and compli-
cated tools on the planet. But 
what can we learn from study-
ing them? A great deal, ac-
cording to Vincent Hayward, 
a professor at the Institut des 
Systèmes Intelligents et de 
Robotique and the Université 
Pierre et Marie Curie, both 
of which are located in Paris, 
France. Hayward presented a 
talk at Carnegie Mellon on Fri-
day titled “How the mechan-
ics of the ?ngertip impact the 
tactile and gripping function 
of the hand,” as part of the Ro-
botics Institute lecture series.
Hayward’s work deals pri-
marily with haptics, which 
he described as “the phenom-
enon of hand guidance by 
touch.” The scope of haptics 
technology can range from 
small molecules to macroscop-
ic systems, the most familiar 
being touch screens. Hayward 
began his talk by introducing 
the complexities, mysteries, 
and abilities of human ?nger-
tips. He noted that ?ngertips 
have unique skin compared to 
other regions of the body and 
that this skin is connected to 
the bone by a network of col-
lagen ?bers — the main com-
ponent of connective tissue. 
He also noted that the bottom 
of the skin is made of keratin, 
a tough structural tissue that 
is the primary material in skin, 
hair, and nails.
The mechanics behind ?n-
gers and hands are also espe-
cially interesting. A hand is 
able to have a very good grip 
by simply being there. Placed 
on a ?at surface, the contact 
made by a ?nger is very close 
to a circle. Fingers also have 
the ability to stiffen, and are 
able to grab objects of differ-
ent weight between ?ve or-
ders of magnitude — from a 
?ne feather to a coarse heavy 
weight. All of these abilities 
make the ?nger a fascinating 
subject. In working with ?n-
gers, Hayward had multiple 
questions, the key question 
being: How does the hand dis-
criminate between all these 
different surfaces? Hayward 
hopes to learn more about the 
interaction between ?ngers 
and surfaces to improve tech-
nologies which utilize tactile 
feedback.
Hayward mentioned many 
previous studies and experi-
ments that dealt with under-
standing the mechanics of 
?nger movement and texture 
perception. These experi-
ments involved a participant 
placing their ?nger in a sort 
of groove. Researchers then 
applied different tactile sur-
faces, which forced the ?n-
gertip to attempt to measure 
what was happening on the 
surface. Overall, it was found 
that friction between the mi-
nuscule ridges of the ?nger 
and the surface played a great 
deal in perception of different 
textures. Hayward looked at 
research regarding the con-
tact between ?ngers and sur-
faces used in technology. He 
focused on the slipping that 
sometimes occurs when one 
is using a touch pad or screen. 
One of the main causes of slip-
ping is the secretion from the 
relatively large number of 
sweat glands under ?ngertips. 
He also discussed how the slid-
ing velocity of a ?ngertip will 
vary with different surface 
materials. When one moves 
a ?nger along a touch screen, 
the increase in secretion from 
the sweat glands changes the 
conformation of the ?nger 
ridges and results in a wider 
contact area between the ?n-
ger and the surface, resulting 
in increased friction. This ef-
fect works the opposite way 
on a porous surface like paper, 
which will absorb ?uid and de-
crease friction over long peri-
ods of contact. Consequently, 
contrary to what one might 
expect, the coef?cient of fric-
tion between a ?ngertip and 
a surface will increase if that 
surface is smooth, like glass, 
and decrease if that surface is 
coarse, like paper.
Hayward ultimately hopes 
that further research into the 
precise mechanisms of touch 
will help develop better tech-
nology like pads, as well as 
robots. In his review article on 
the subject, “Finger pad fric-
tion and its role in grip and 
touch,” Hayward mentions the 
importance of touch technol-
ogy in robotics and prosthet-
ics. New materials that more 
closely mimic the real expe-
rience of human touch will 
ultimately lead to greatly en-
hanced functions.

Computer game used to design novel sequences of RNA
RAGHUNANDAN AVULA
Staffwriter
Nature at the molecular 
level can be described as hav-
ing beautiful complexity. In 
the fabric of space and time, 
molecules come together to 
form structures and chemical 
interactions that are funda-
mental for life. Understanding 
and recreating this complexity 
has baf?ed scientists for de-
cades. To tackle this problem, 
a team at Carnegie Mellon 
University has created EteR-
NA, a computer game that en-
ables players around the world 
to construct novel and robust 
RNA sequences that could po-
tentially be utilized in biologi-
cal experiments.
RNA is a mysterious mol-
ecule, and has more secrets 
than its better known counter-
part, DNA. Unlike DNA, which 
has a rigid double helix struc-
ture, RNA can be very variable 
in shape and size. It has the 
ability to store information in 
its bases, as well as to fold into 
speci?c shapes that allow it to 
carry out a multitude of func-
tions at the molecular level. 
This variability can make it 
very complicated for scientists 
to simulate and mimic nature’s 
complicated RNA designs.
EteRNA, which launched 
in January 2011, is an online 
computer game that aims to 
build new sequences of RNA. 
Developed by a team of stu-
dents and faculty at Carnegie 
Mellon and led by professor of 
computer science and robotics 
Adrien Treuille and doctoral 
student in computer science 
Jeehyung Lee, EteRNA has 
come to life with a current 
community of over 130,000 
members.
Lee explained that the RNA 
design problem is “not just 
computationally hard,” but 
that “the simulation model is 
incomplete and there is just 
no current way to simulate 
RNA design.” Before EteRNA, 
RNA design had been left to 
researchers repeatedly trying 
various designs in the lab.
Certain sequences are more 
robust or stable at the molecu-
lar level. The challenge lies 
in determining what guide-
lines or rules can be followed 
to contribute to this stability 
while also performing the de-
sired function.
In the game, players start 
with a basic foundation for an 
RNA molecule and then make 
a series of decisions and addi-
tions to build a molecule. Play-
ers can challenge each other to 
build more stable structures. 
When asked how much biolog-
ical experience players needed 
to play EteRNA, Lee replied, 
“none.”
“Over 90 percent of our top 
players don’t have any previ-
ous biological background,” 
Lee said.
When the game ?rst 
launched, Lee and Treullie 
recruited about 100–200 play-
ers. Lee shared that the play-
ers initially struggled with 
building good RNA designs. 
However, improvements in the 
game and players’ intuition 
lead to the design of robot 
RNAs. After it was discussed in 
The New York Times, the game 
gained over 30,000 members 
in the following month.
Lee exclaimed that they are 
actively “turning players into 
RNA scientists.” He added that 
players ?nd the game to be “an 
entertaining environment and 
enjoyable experience.”
RNA sequences that are 
designed through the game 
are then sent to Dr. Rhiju Das, 
an assistant professor of bio-
chemistry at Stanford Univer-
sity who builds these RNAs in 
the lab and preforms tests to 
determine their stability.
Initially, the project’s main 
goal was simply to build ro-
bust RNA molecules. Then 
the team increased their focus 
to ?guring out what general 
design rules they could de-
termine from stable RNA de-
signs. Lee believes that, maybe 
one day in the distant future, 
we will be able to use these 
rules to create computer simu-
lations that can create RNA 
structures. However, the abil-
ity to create these structures 
remains a challenge since it is 
hard to document all of a play-
er’s decisions in creating these 
molecules.
The current goal is to 
evolve the project into an on-
line community where RNA 
scientists from around the 
world can post their research 
problems and desired goals for 
a potential RNA. 
Then, if players deem the 
project worthy, they can work 
with the researcher to design 
RNAs that ?t the require-
ments. The structures that 
players determine will actu-
ally be synthesized at Stanford 
University.
This type of collaboration 
can foster advancement in 
RNA research. RNA has po-
tential medical implications 
where scientists can design 
RNAs to carry out speci?c 
function-altering molecular 
interactions that play impor-
tant roles in disease.
Lee hopes that they will 
move from a 2-D to a 3-D in-
terface to improve the user ex-
perience.
SCITECH BRIEFSHOW THINGS WORKVarying air temperatures cause miragesElongated skulls could belong to new species
A graveyard of 3,000-year-
old skeletons with elongated 
skulls was discovered on the 
Paracus Peninsula in Peru 
by archaeologist Julio Tello 
in 1928. A recent announce-
ment made by Paracas Mu-
seum assistant director, re-
searcher, and author Brien 
Foerster regarding these 
skulls has resulted in scien-
ti?c controversy. 
While it has previously 
been speculated that the 
elongated skulls were the re-
sult of cranial deformation, 
recent studies have shown 
that these skeletons may be-
long to an entirely new spe-
cies. One way to tell that a 
skull is human is whether or 
not the skull in question has 
retained the original volume 
of a human skull. The ?rst 
indication that these skulls 
from Peru may belong to a 
new species is the fact that 
the Paracas skulls are 2.5 
times the volume of the aver-
age human skull. 
In addition, DNA testing 
of hair, teeth, and bone from 
?ve of the skulls has revealed 
DNA mutations that have 
never been seen in humans, 
primates, or any other 
animal; some have even 
entertained the idea that the 
skulls may be an extrater-
restrial species. The implica-
tions of this discovery are 
enormous, although further 
studies will need to be con-
ducted before the origin of 
this species can be veri?ed.

Nye and Ham debate evolution versus creationism
In a highly watched event, 
the well-known scientist Bill 
Nye faced off with the cre-
ationist CEO and founder of 
Answers in Genesis-U.S. and 
the Creation Museum Ken 
Ham in a debate pitting sci-
ence against religion. The 
debate happened in Ham’s 
museum in Petersburg, Ken-
tucky and included serious 
debate on the topic of evolu-
tion versus creationism. 
Nye brought evidence in 
the form of fossils, pictures of 
glaciers, and even rock from 
underneath the museum to 
argue his case for why the 
Earth is actually billions of 
years old. Nye emphasized 
that science depends on pre-
dictions and evidence.
Ham, on the other hand, 
used his interpretation of the 
Bible to argue for his case 
that the Earth was formed a 
few thousand years ago and 
that all life forms descended 
from an initial 10,000 dif-
ferent species. Ham’s point 
— which might seem absurd 
to those that are part of the 
scienti?c community — has 
validity because the crux of 
the creationism argument 
lies on the fundamental idea 
that historical science, or 
science about the past, can 
never be proven and is al-
ways up to interpretation.

CMU presents healthcare conference 
RAGHUNANDAN AVULA
Staffwriter
Recent studies shockingly 
show that only about 54 per-
cent of physician diagnoses 
are usually correct, according 
to Sameer Badlani, chief med-
ical information of?cer for the 
University of Chicago depart-
ment of medicine. 
Those involved in the 
healthcare industry ?nd this 
fact unacceptable and hope to 
use technology to revolution-
ize patient care. 
However, William Bria — 
the chief medical information 
of?cer of the Shriners Hospi-
tal for Children — stated that 
this time of innovation is also 
a time of disruption. To tackle 
many of the challenges of in-
corporating technology into 
a scrambled healthcare sys-
tem, Carnegie Mellon’s Heinz 
College and Tepper School of 
Business hosted the 3rd An-
nual Innovation in Healthcare 
Technology Conference on 
Friday.
The conference was not 
just for health professionals — 
it brought together individu-
als from many different ?elds 
of study, including business 
and information technologies. 
The venue, the Omni William 
Penn Hotel in Downtown, 
provided a professional atmo-
sphere for important discus-
sions regarding the future of 
healthcare in our country.
Bria, the conference’s key-
note speaker, emphasized that 
American healthcare was built 
on the intimate doctor-patient 
relationship. 
In the past few years, dif-
ferent health systems around 
the country have tried incor-
porating technology, which 
has led to a fragmented sys-
tem that has lost some of the 
genuineness of the relation-
ship that originally brought 
the United States to its place 
as the world’s leader in 
healthcare. 
He pointed out symptoms 
of the challenge of incorporat-
ing technology in medicine. 
Through discussions among 
leaders in the industry, he 
hopes to promote innovative 
solutions to the multitude of 
problems in medicine, as well 
as to integrate advances in 
technology into the ?eld while 
maintaining that the “heart of 
the doctor remains the soul of 
medicine.”
The conference highlighted 
Carnegie Mellon’s well-known 
interdisciplinary atmosphere 
by featuring a poster session 
that included students and 
faculty from the University of 
Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon’s 
Heinz College, and the Mellon 
College of Science.
Joseph Samosky, director 
of the Simulation and Medi-
cal Technology R&D Center at 
the University of Pittsburgh, 
showed a live demonstration 
of the BodyExplorer, a simu-
lation of medical procedures 
involving a mannequin with 
embedded sensors and a pro-
jector displaying human anat-
omy on the mannequin.
The project can be used to 
improve training by allowing 
medical students to practice 
performing procedures while 
providing immediate results 
of their mistakes through 
realistic alarms and patient 
responses.
Carnegie Mellon depart-
ment of biological sciences re-
search biologist Cheryl Telmer 
was in attendance to highlight 
the International Genetically 
Engineered Machine (iGEM) 
team’s project, which em-
bodies the interdisciplinary 
nature of projects on campus 
by bringing together under-
graduate engineers, computer 
scientists, and biologists to 
work on a unique project. 
She shared her passion for 
the project, which addressed 
the problem of antibiotic re-
sistance with phage therapy, 
saying that “every project is 
an invention” and that she 
found the conference to be the 
perfect place to showcase her 
students’ hard work.Through-
out the day, multiple panels 
of experts in a variety of ?elds 
from the technological and 
pharmaceutical industries, as 
well as distinguished physi-
cians, held interactive forums 
tackling some of the biggest 
challenges facing technology 
and healthcare.
Discussions involved the 
rise of social medicine by 
creating patient and doctor 
online communities where 
patients can become more 
empowered by sharing their 
experiences, and doctors can 
collaborate to correctly diag-
nose patients. The idea was 
that health and medicine 
could only improve through 
the collaboration of individu-
als, rather than through the 
efforts of individuals alone.
The recent National Secu-
rity Agency (NSA) scandal has 
brought to light many issues 
involving the legality of col-
lecting large amounts of data 
regarding patient care. What 
types of information should 
be allowed to be acquired? 
Who is responsible for the se-
curity of the data?
Modern technological ad-
vances like smart watches are 
pushing people toward an age 
where one can monitor a wide 
variety of bodily functions and 
natural patterns of stress and 
sleep. In some cases, patients 
can be monitored by sensors 
at all times while at home. If 
the data shows a medical is-
sue while the patient is at 
home and no action is taken, 
who should be liable for the 
failure to act? Unfortunately, 
physicians are scared of im-
plementing this revolution-
ary technology because they 
fear possible litigation from 
lawyers who attack those with 
larger pockets.
Badlani, who was a pan-
elist at the conference, be-
lieves that the gold mine lies 
“in developing statistical and 
analytical techniques to de-
tect signals in the data that 
action needs to be taken to 
ensure that people receive the 
appropriate care in a timely 
manner.”
Recently, the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) 
regulated 23andMe, a genetic 
testing company, preventing 
them from releasing genetic 
test results that could exam-
ine DNA and reveal informa-
tion like a 5 percent increased 
risk of Alzheimer’s Disease. 
All the physicians in the panel 
fully supported the FDA rul-
ing and agreed that genetic 
testing will lead to revolutions 
in healthcare, but that it is 
too early to allow this testing 
without fully understanding 
how genes can be in?uenced 
by the environment.
To close, Heinz College 
Dean Ramayya Krishnan 
shared his vision for calculat-
ing risk in healthcare by using 
statistics to improve patient 
care, as well as for making risk 
and cost comparisons. These 
panelists hope that these 
ideas and discussions will en-
able leaders in healthcare to 
incorporate technology that 
improves the system for the 
American people.
SKYE TOOR
Special to The Tartan
23andMe — a privately 
held personal genomics com-
pany — has dominated the 
market for genetic testing 
since it began its direct-to-
consumer DNA testing ser-
vice in 2007. For $99, a con-
sumer could send a sample of 
their saliva in for testing and 
receive an interpreted report 
of their sequenced genome, 
which includes information 
such as inherited traits, gene-
alogy, and risk of congenital 
diseases. However, there has 
been some controversy over 
the ethics of the services that 
23andMe and other direct-
to-consumer testing com-
panies offer. For example, 
23andMe was close to being 
banned from producing this 
kind of testing by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) last December. In 
its announcement, the FDA 
claimed that its concerns 
with the product rose from 
the questionable accuracy 
and interpretation of its ge-
netic reports.
How accurate are these 
test results? ScienceNow re-
ports that 23andMe provides 
customers with a 70–75 per-
cent con?dence that a gene 
in a result is present. As 
part of their genetic report, 
23andMe also reports a con-
?dence interval from the 
database of the J. Craig Ven-
ter Institute — a genomics 
research organization — on 
how accurately the gene is 
linked with a disease and an-
other con?dence interval on 
how likely it is that the gene 
will develop into a disease. 
A way to further verify these 
intervals is still under de-
velopment. The accuracy of 
these tests is crucial because 
a false positive could cause 
an individual to seek treat-
ment for a disease they do 
not have, while a false nega-
tive could cause a disease to 
go unnoticed.
Perhaps just as important 
as the accuracy of the tests is 
the way the resulting report 
is interpreted. Genetic test re-
sults are intended to be taken 
to a doctor after their release. 
When 23andMe ?rst took 
off, the National Institutes 
of Health (NIH) published 
their views on the up-and-
coming industry, claiming 
that as of that day, doctors 
were not skilled in statistics, 
but would have to be in years 
to come. The NIH defended 
the premise as a market force 
on the training of medical 
professionals to learn more 
about statistics and data min-
ing. Since then — seeing as 
nothing has been done to in-
crease the statistical training 
received by doctors — a sheet 
of raw-data-style genetic 
tests could prove problematic 
for a patient who brings it to 
their doctor.
There is also a question of 
FDA jurisdiction. As the regu-
latory body, the FDA is auto-
matically given permission 
to regulate any and all things 
deemed “healthcare” by the 
government. 
Of?cially, the NIH and the 
National Science Foundation 
(NSF) should have dealt with 
23andMe, but neither agency 
had the power to do anything 
as drastic as shutting the 
product down completely. 
The FDA has the power to 
regulate food and drugs, but 
whether they also have the 
power to prevent patients 
from seeking out speci?c in-
formation that could lead to 
them taking different drugs 
or eating different foods is

Last Monday, President Subra 
Suresh announced ProSEED to the 
campus community via email. Pro-
SEED is a program created to pro-
vide Carnegie Mellon students and 
af?liates with funding to facilitate 
the growth of early-stage seed proj-
ects. President Suresh announced 
that the program will be launched 
immediately and that it will serve as 
a support network for various seed-
funding initiatives to assist various 
members of the campus community.
The Tartan commends President 
Suresh for enacting ProSEED quickly 
in response to student and faculty 
suggestions for improvement that he 
received during his campus-wide lis-
tening tours. 
The initiative arrives just under 
eight months after President Suresh 
was inaugurated on July 1. President 
Suresh enacted this new program as 
part of the category “Seed Funding 
of New Ideas,” which he identi?ed 
as one of ?ve areas of continued dia-
logue between himself and campus 
members.
It is promising to see that Presi-
dent Suresh has taken into consider-
ation what he has heard on his listen-
ing tours and is beginning to provide 
tangible programs in response to 
the concerns that many people have 
brought to light. The speed with 
which President Suresh announced 
this program, as well as the clear in-
tentions and identi?able bene?ts of 
the program, are impressive.
ProSEED funds projects to en-
hance the campus community 
and campus culture. One applica-
tion available through ProSEED is 
Crosswalk. According to President 
Suresh’s email, grants given through 
this application can be used to fund 
projects across multiple depart-
ments, more sections of popular 
courses for non-majors, and various 
campus life enhancements. Another 
application, Simon Initiative Seed 
Grants, can be used for projects that 
“use data-driven learning technolo-
gies,” according to the email.
These grants are clearly intend-
ed to enhance student, faculty, and 
staff life, and President Suresh has 
provided a clear way for community 
members to secure them for their 
projects.
As President Suresh continues his 
listening tour throughout the aca-
demic year, The Tartan hopes that he 
will provide further speci?c ways in 
which he is addressing the ?ve cat-
egories of interest that he identi?ed 
in October toward the start of his 
presidency. The announcement of 
ProSEED is promising; it is looking 
hopeful that the remaining four cat-
egories will be addressed in the same 
fashion.

Zoo euthanasia a tragic but inevitable reality
Last Sunday, Copenhagen Zoo 
euthanized an 18-month-old giraffe 
named Marius via bolt gun to the 
head. Afterward, the giraffe was 
dissected in front of a crowd of zoo-
goers and fed to the lions, according 
to CNN.
The death of Marius has been met 
with public outcry, especially given 
that a petition to save the healthy 
young giraffe’s life circulated the 
Internet and failed. While the death 
of the giraffe was tragic, the zoo 
was well within its rights to kill the 
animal. Copenhagen Zoo supporters 
claim that the giraffe was euthanized 
to conserve space and resources, as 
well as to avoid inbreeding. The zoo 
also claimed that Marius’s genetic 
makeup was already well represent-
ed in his breeding program, accord-
ing to NPR.
Copenhagen Zoo critics claim that 
the zoo killed Marius because it was 
no longer cost effective to keep him; 
he was no longer a baby animal that 
brought in crowds. Some have sug-
gested that Marius could have been 
sent to a different zoo, or released, 
or simply kept near Copenhagen. But 
none of these solutions are as easy as 
they seem, and all cost money.
This debate brings up important 
questions about the role and purpose 
of zoos. Our cultural image of zoos is 
that of a place where endangered an-
imals are conserved, but this view is 
overly simplistic. Zoos serve as con-
servation centers for endangered an-
imals, but they are also institutions 
with limited resources, and keeping 
animals — especially long-living ani-
mals — is not cheap. The zoo does 
not have endless resources to funnel 
into the preservation of all of their 
animals, especially ones that are not 
genetically rare and, therefore, in 
need of special preservation effort.
This reality is neither clean nor 
pretty, but that does not change the 
circumstances and problems that 
these zoos face.
Admittedly, perhaps the zoo 
should not have performed a public 
autopsy on the animal, but even that 
was a rare, voluntary opportunity for 
any zoo-goers who wished to learn 
about giraffe anatomy. As for feed-
ing the body to the lions, while again 
the zoo could have been more sensi-
tive about the public nature of the 
disposal of Marius’s remains, feed-
ing the meat to other animals that 
require it to live is not something 
shameful.
Marius’s death was certainly trag-
ic and unfortunate because he was a 
unique living thing, but each of the 
10.2 million land animals killed for 
food in the United States in 2011 was 
a special living thing as well. The Co-
penhagen Zoo merely made the mis-
take of putting the manner and af-
termath of the animal’s death within 
the sphere of public knowledge.
Tech companies’ special treatment unjusti?ed
Tensions are high between tech-
nology companies, like Google and 
Facebook, in Silicon Valley and the 
residents of San Francisco.
The cause of the ruckus is the 
presence of mammoth shuttle buses 
employed to ferry around technol-
ogy company employees that have 
been illegally using city bus stops as 
their own private pick up points, The 
New York Times reports.
Residents are upset not only 
by the lack of consequences the 
companies face — as stopping in a 
public bus stop should carry a ?ne 
of $279 — but also the wealth di-
vide and domination of previously 
low-income neighborhoods by the 
wealthy “techies.” One only has to 
look around at the number of Google 
backpacks or Dropbox t-shirts on 
campus to see the number of Carne-
gie Mellon students getting involved 
in the technology world of the Silicon 
Valley and who may soon be thrown 
into this arising con?ict.
Obviously, companies who are 
paying up to six-?gure salaries to its 
mid-level employees, according to 
The New York Times, have no excuse 
for not at least paying a reasonable 
rate to the city of San Francisco for 
use of their bus stops. 
These companies wrongfully 
act as if giving the honor of their 
presence to the city makes this bad 
behavior excusable when it is clear-
ly not. There is no excuse for these 
companies to not be good corporate 
citizens.
On the opposite side of the coin, 
the tactics being used by San Fran-
cisco residents in this class struggle 
are unacceptable as well. The New 
York Times reports that public cam-
paigns targeting lone employees in 
their neighborhood and breaking 
windows of the contested buses are 
some of the methods being used by 
protesters.
Are complaints against the cur-
rent busing system valid? Yes, of 
course protesting illegal behavior is 
valid, but isolation tactics and vio-
lence are not solutions to either the 
bus issue or the broader class strug-
gles. Income inequality is a huge 
problem in this country but one that 
must be dealt with through legisla-
tion, not public shaming.
Middle class growth key  
to combat U.S. inequality
MOHAMMED BURNY
Junior Staffwriter
Income inequality has become 
an increasingly common term in the 
last three years. 
Occupy Wall Street’s emergence 
in 2011, with its rhetoric of the 99 
percent versus the 1 percent, sug-
gested the potency of income in-
equality as a political issue. 
Elizabeth Warren’s (D–Mass.) 
skyrocketing national appeal, fu-
eled by her pointed advocacy for the 
American middle class, hinted at the 
reservoir of support available for a 
savvy candidate willing to give voice 
to many Americans’ sense of unfair 
economic treatment. 
Bill de Blasio expertly tapped 
into this sentiment throughout his 
successful campaign for mayor of 
New York City, trumpeting that New 
York told a “tale of two cities” — 
rich and poor — that needed to be 
reconciled. 
Finally, President Barack Obama 
carried the baton into 2014 dur-
ing his State of the Union Address: 
“Today, after four years of economic 
growth, those at the top have never 
done better. But average wages have 
barely budged. Inequality has deep-
ened. Upward mobility has stalled.”
What facts support this rheto-
ric? The disappearance of well-
paying manufacturing jobs, which 
historically ushered a broad swath 
of Americans into the middle class, 
is blamed for this rise in income 
inequality. 
The American middle class today 
can handily be described as an hour-
glass — wide at the top and bottom, 
where it is populated by the rich and 
the poor respectively, and narrow in 
the middle, due to a shrinking mid-
dle class.
Even more compelling is the 
available data. The single most ar-
resting statistic, drawn from the 
2012 Economic Report of the Presi-
dent, states that between 1979 and 
2007, real after-tax income grew 
roughly 38 percent for 99 percent 
of Americans and 278 percent for 
the top one percent. Americans in 
the 81st to 99th percentiles saw a 
real income growth of 65 percent in 
those three decades. 
Meanwhile, the top one percent 
in that quintile enjoyed more than 
four times as much income growth 
as the rest of this wealthiest group 
of Americans. Truly, Occupy Wall 
Street’s slogan — “We are the 99 
percent!” — was empirical gold.
How do our political parties re-
spond to these statistics? Republi-
cans argue that income inequality 
is the natural consequence of differ-
ently talented individuals compet-
ing in a free marketplace. 
The promise of high incomes 
motivates some individuals to work 
hard and take entrepreneurial and 
innovative risks that may create 
both great personal wealth and 
whole new industries. Capitalism, 
governed by the invisible hand of 
economics, rewards each individual 
according to his talent and his work 
ethic, and differing incomes merely 
represent the differing value of 
each individual in the marketplace. 
Therefore, while income inequality 
may be disquieting in the short run, 
it produces such goods and services 
in the long run as to make the daily 
life of a poor person today more con-
venient than that of a rich person 
decades ago.
This argument is sound, but it 
does not address the recent spike in 
income inequality. The post-WWII 
era, a halcyon ideal of the Ameri-
can conservative, was marked by 
historically low income inequality. 
How can the American conservative 
then, with a straight face, dismiss 
spiking income inequality today as 
a minor byproduct of the machinery 
of capitalism? 
After all, the conservative vision 
seeks order at nearly all costs. A de-
mocracy driven by great disparity in 
wealth is vulnerable to angry popu-
lism, in addition to mob rule and its 
attendant chaos.
Journalist for The New Yorker 
George Packer eloquently observed 
that inequality, by dividing us from 
one another, “makes it harder to 
imagine the lives of others.” Such 
failure of imagination is the death 
knell of a democracy, for democracy 
demands us to intelligently select 
the best possible course of action for 
our country and all our fellow citi-
zens and trust that they can and will 
do the same.
Though Democrats brought in-
come inequality to the forefront of 
the national political conversation, 
their solutions are short-sighted. 
No sane liberal would propose 
a scheme of perfect egalitarianism, 
but while equality of income may 
be utopian, equality of opportunity 
is not. 
Liberal solutions too often seek to 
raise taxes on the rich, but this redis-
tribution of wealth — after incomes 
have already been established in the 
marketplace — chases a problem 
rather than confronting it. 
Smarter solutions, including 
public investments in education, 
infrastructure, and sustainable 
energy, would create numerous 
middle-class jobs and lessen wide-
spread income inequality. By driving 
middle-class growth, the hourglass 
could be ?lled out for decades to 
come, rather than moving wealth by 
state ?at from the rich to the poor.

A PERSON’S OPINION
February 17, 2014 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A7
Compiled by Sara Remi Fields
The Tartan celebrated a day of hearts and chocolate this week! So we asked,
What do you think about Valentine’s Day?
Death of the Tea Party imminent
XIYU WANG 
On Tuesday, the House of Rep-
resentatives did something it hasn’t 
done in over two years: it increased 
the debt ceiling without a crisis. 
While this is a major success in 
and of itself, what it says about the 
state of the Tea Party is even more 
remarkable.
For the last few years, the die-
hard conservative Tea Party move-
ment has stymied the American 
legislative process with its love for 
?libusters and hatred for an ef?cient 
federal government. 
However, the successful passage 
of a “clean” debt ceiling bill — one 
that raises the debt ceiling without 
any further conditions — despite 
opposition from the Tea Party, rep-
resents a tipping point for the Tea 
Party’s success. In fact, the passage 
of this bill may be the start of the 
end for the Tea Party, considering a 
number of larger forces behind its 
decline.
For one thing, the Affordable 
Care Act, or Obamacare, is going into 
effect. Although the Tea Party dedi-
cated a major part of its platform to 
repealing it, Obamacare is becoming 
more of a reality by the day. States 
have already set up exchanges, mil-
lions of people have already signed 
up, and major businesses have adapt-
ed to the new rules. Repealing it at 
this point would do more harm than 
good, adding $109 billion to the fed-
eral de?cit over the next 10 years, ac-
cording to the Congressional Budget 
Of?ce.
Furthermore, people are getting 
tired of the Tea Party’s obstructive 
politics, especially from within the 
Republican Party. Prominent Re-
publicans, including former White 
House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl 
Rove and U.S. Senator John McCain 
(R–Ariz), have publicly criticized the 
Tea Party’s tactics. According to The 
Wall Street Journal, House Republi-
can leaders and various conservative 
groups have been aiming to weaken 
the power of the Tea Party caucus.
Some Republicans are working 
with allies outside the GOP establish-
ment to ?ght Tea Party Republicans. 
More moderate Republicans have 
even teamed up with labor unions, 
according to The Daily Caller.
Finally, new political concerns, 
beyond the scope of Tea Party de-
mands, are now being addressed. 
The Tea Party came into promi-
nence 2008–2012, during the post-
President George W. Bush crises. 
This era was one of economic down-
turn, bank bailouts, continued war 
in the Middle East, and increased 
government de?cits and debt that 
spurred popular anger against the 
establishment.
However, in 2014, six years after 
the recession began in 2008, much 
of the hysteria about national debt 
and high taxes has settled down. 
Now, issues such as long-term un-
employment and income inequality 
have begun to capture the national 
consciousness. While there remains 
a powerful sentiment against in-
creased government power, the gov-
ernment shutdown last year proved 
that the Tea Party’s vision of lax gov-
ernance was not a viable alternative.
Although the Tea Party will likely 
still be around for the next few years, 
it is unlikely that it will ever have the 
amount of in?uence it did prior to 
2013.

Dramatic political climate promises exciting decade
GORDON ESTES
Junior Staffwriter
After six years of gridlock, it’s 
no surprise that Congress is one of 
the most unpopular institutions in 
America. With an approval rating 
of 13 percent, according to a Janu-
ary 2014 Gallup Poll, the United 
States legislature has now been less 
popular than cockroaches and colo-
noscopies consistently since 2012.
More and more hands point to 
party polarization as the root cause 
of the U.S. Congress’s unpopularity. 
As the Republicans and Democrats 
drift solidly to the right and left, re-
spectively, it’s not hard to see why 
the word “compromise” has become 
a form of political suicide.
Yet, growing divisions within 
each party seem to be changing the 
status quo. Cracks, which began Ed-
ward Snowden’s leak of classi?ed 
documents belonging to the Nation-
al Security Agency (NSA) last year, 
may be growing in the dam of con-
gressional fundamentalism.
On Wednesday, Senator Rand 
Paul (R–Ky.) ?led a lawsuit against 
the Obama administration for the 
NSA’s collection of bulk phone data 
records. According to The New York 
Times, Paul stated, “Can a single 
warrant allow the government to 
collect all your records, all the time? 
I don’t think so.”
This announcement likely incited 
the celebration of the millions of lib-
ertarian voters that comprise a ma-
jority of Paul’s base of support. It’s 
no surprise that the NSA’s wiretap-
ping ways yield comparisons to Or-
well’s “Big Brother,” the ideological 
enemy of libertarians worldwide.
Although Paul’s objections have 
largely been dismissed by his own 
party, he is far from alone in his cru-
sade. The NSA leaks and the subse-
quent protests regarding Internet 
freedom and privacy have mobi-
lized an army of angry voters from 
college-age youth — a traditionally 
liberal voting bloc, according to The 
Huf?ngton Post. The American Civil 
Liberties Union (ACLU) has also 
?led against the NSA’s programs, 
intending to question, or even over-
throw, the NSA’s legal status.
The ACLU and Paul are more 
than unlikely bedfellows, but this 
partnership is not quite without 
precedent. Last March, Paul led a 
13-hour ?libuster over drone strikes, 
attacking the administration’s de-
fense of targeted killings. 
More recently, the ACLU has 
brought its own lawsuit against the 
Obama administration for using 
drone strikes outside the context of 
armed con?ict and basing its attacks 
on vague legal standards, a closed 
executive process, and evidence 
withheld from the courts.
Both the NSA’s potential abuse 
of power and the Obama adminis-
tration’s expansion of drone strikes 
seem to strike a common nerve be-
tween Big Brother-fearing libertar-
ians and “hippie” liberals. But what 
might this reaction mean as part of a 
larger, political trend?
It’s easy to forget that the 2014 
midterm elections are nearly upon 
us, and in the not-quite-distant fu-
ture, the 2016 presidential election 
lurks like a shadow on the horizon. 
Already, potential candidates are 
gearing up for war, staging fundrais-
ers and publicity stunts left and right 
while they do their best to shore up 
their respective power bases.
A new axis seems to be emerg-
ing on the political scene. While 
once politicians debated primar-
ily economics and religion, personal 
freedom has now become a rallying 
cry for future generations of voters. 
The Republican Party is ?nding its 
foundations shaken after discover-
ing that years of extreme right be-
liefs have driven away a bounty of 
young voters with new ideas and 
full pockets. The Southern strategy 
is all but guaranteed to die off with 
the Baby Boomers, and the Tea Party 
has been dismissed to the highlands 
of Appalachia and the empty plains 
of Alaska.
Where do we go from here? It’s 
clear that the two-party system is on 
shaky ground, but without the re-
moval of ?rst-past-the-post voting, 
the donkey and elephant are likely 
here to stay. The European model of 
coalitions and multitudes of parties 
is unlikely to transfer to the United 
States, where third parties like the 
Libertarian Party and the Green Par-
ty have little chance of getting their 
voices heard in any serious national 
vote.
Yet the political scene is shift-
ing beneath our feet, and it’s liable 
to turn inside-out at any moment. 
It’s impossible to tell the future, but 
forecasting it is within reach. Yes, 
the 2014 midterm elections are ap-
proaching, bringing with them the 
potential of new policies and new 
directions. And soon afterward, 
the campaign for the 2016 White 
House will begin in earnest, and our 
country’s changes will shift into full 
focus.
For now, however, we can only 
watch and wait as our horses gallop 
toward the ?nish line. The 2014 and 
2016 storms will come in their own 
due time. Beyond that, who knows? 
One thing is clear, though: It’s shap-
ing up to be one hell of a decade.
Mortar Board lecture inspires students 
BRANDON SCHMUCK
Last Thursday, I had the honor of 
hearing one of the best lectures of my 
life. Titled “The Moral of the Story,” 
held by senior honor society Mortar 
Board in McConomy Auditorium, the 
event featured four prominent Carn-
egie Mellon professors, who shared 
their personal experiences in hopes 
that students could use them to bet-
ter their lives. Overall, they gave 
great advice over a wide array of life 
topics, coupled with many exciting 
and almost unbelievable stories.
First to take the stage was associ-
ate teaching professor in the depart-
ment of statistics, Rebecca Nugent. 
She centered her presentation on 
the best and worst decisions that she 
made throughout her life. 
While she ?lled her presentation 
with much humor, such as not drink-
ing the “yellow vodka” of Ukrainians 
in Antarctica, she presented a well-
thought-out thesis to her presenta-
tion: Follow your gut. 
She exempli?ed this lesson 
through her own personal experienc-
es, such as her mistake of continuing 
to date her boyfriend simply because 
she was caught up in the momentum 
of life and found it simpler to keep 
riding than change. 
Advice like this applies to nearly 
everyone. Whether you ?nd your-
self with the wrong person, in the 
wrong major, or simply making one 
wrong decision because it is easier to 
ride the momentum, Nugent’s words 
have signi?cant value.
The next speaker was School of 
Computer Science teaching profes-
sor David Kosbie, who brought forth 
a roller coaster of emotions. 
The most heart-rending part of 
the event was his story about a for-
mer student who was diagnosed 
with cancer and spent his ?nal days 
working on his 15-112 term project. 
Kosbie described almost failing to 
make the decision to drive nine-and-
a-half hours to attend the student’s 
funeral. 
As he stated, people always try to 
make excuses for why they should 
not do things. However, we should 
follow our intuitions and do what 
we know is right. There were great 
similarities between Kosbie’s words 
of inspiration and those of the late 
Carnegie Mellon computer science 
professor and famed author of The 
Last Lecture, Randy Pausch.
Teaching professor and associate 
department head of the department 
of mathematical sciences John 
Mackey, then took the stage, with his 
signature two-liter of Diet Coke in 
hand, and spoke poignantly.
“We tend to make 
such a big deal out 
of small things, 
which causes us to 
forget that which 
is important: the 
people around us.”
Mackey described his hard life 
growing up in rural Ohio and be-
ing beaten up for defending his gay 
brother. Instead of simply being 
stepped on, he was inspired to work 
out and grow stronger. He focused 
much of his presentation on doing 
things that make you uncomfortable 
and standing up for yourself. 
The perspectives he gained from 
his life experiences were quite in-
teresting. Perhaps one of his most 
interesting learning experiences was 
being a victim of racial prejudice 
?rst-hand in Hawaii. Instead of be-
ing upset by the incident, he enthu-
siastically turned it into a learning 
experience.
Last but not least was Robert F. 
Culbertson, adjunct assistant profes-
sor of entrepreneurship in the Tep-
per School of Business. Culbertson 
brought the event to a close with his 
experiences in entrepreneurship. He 
too stressed following your gut feel-
ing and expressed deep regret about 
the fact that he turned down a din-
ner with Steve Jobs when a friend 
from college contacted him. 
The sincerity on his face was ap-
parent as he stated that some deci-
sions could not be undone. He then 
showed his poetic side and ?nished 
his speech by having everyone in 
the audience clap while he rapped 
about all that the speakers said. He 
was a great choice for a conclud-
ing speaker, as he had many shock-
ing and exciting stories to tell, and 
his rap brought everything together 
humorously.
The entire presentation was pow-
erful and moving — a reminder that 
perhaps a failed test or the girl who 
got away is not the end of the world. 
We tend to make such a big deal out 
of small things, which causes us to 
forget that which is important: the 
people around us. 
We become so engulfed in our 
work that we cause ourselves to turn 
down opportunities, such as meeting 
Steve Jobs or attending the funeral 
of someone who touched us deeply.
“The Moral of the Story” was a 
good reminder that we cannot fully 
control our fate, and the only way 
that we will enjoy our lives is if we 
enjoy the journey along the way and 
make time for what really matters. 
Ironically, my decision to attend this 
event was a spontaneous one, but I 
am glad that I followed my gut feel-
ing and heard all that these speakers 
had to say. This event was inspiring, 
and I hope to see more like it in the 
future.

NISHANT RENIWAL
Junior Staffwriter
In one of the most competi-
tive Premier League seasons 
in recent memory, Liverpool 
made a season-de?ning state-
ment last weekend with a 5–1 
thrashing of league leaders 
Arsenal. Over recent seasons, 
Liverpool has been much ma-
ligned for its thin squad, mid-
table talent, and inability to 
?nish higher than Merseyside 
neighbors Everton, let alone 
in the top four. Even though 
Liverpool ?nished in seventh 
place last season, the team’s 
progress to fourth and poten-
tial title contenders is not as 
abrupt as it seems. This seam-
less transition to a top-level 
team must be credited to one 
man only — manager Brendan 
Rodgers.
 Rodgers started out at as 
the youth team manager at 
Chelsea under then-manager 
Jose Mourinho, staying in that 
position under Avram Grant 
and Luiz Felipe Scolari. He 
moved on to coach Watford in 
the championship; after an im-
pressive stint there, he attract-
ed the attention of promotion 
hopefuls Reading. However, 
he was sacked from the club 
after a poor run of form and 
took over at Swansea City.
It was at Swansea City that 
he gained countrywide fame 
as he guided the Welsh club 
to their ?rst ever promotion 
to the Premier League, ?nish-
ing a solid 11th in his ?rst full 
season in the top ?ight. Swan-
sea City’s slick passing style 
was compared to the Spanish 
tiki-taka and won over neu-
trals. Top clubs were circling, 
and when Kenny Dalglish was 
sacked from Liverpool, Rod-
gers was chosen as the new 
manager.
 He was handed a Liver-
pool team with Andy Carroll 
and Luis Suárez as the only 
reliable strikers, a barren mid-
?eld, and an underwhelming 
defense. Rodgers attempted 
to make some changes in the 
transfer market by bringing in 
familiar faces — striker Fabio 
Borini, who played under him 
at Chelsea and Swansea City, 
as well as Joe Allen, Swan-
sea City’s standout mid?elder 
from the previous season. 
Rodgers was also essential in 
the development of the club’s 
then 17-year-old talented 
winger, Raheem Sterling, who 
is now a regular in the side.
The ?rst season under Rod-
gers was a disappointment, 
however; a lack of ?repower 
meant Liverpool was slow out 
of the blocks and stuck in the 
lower end of the table for the 
majority of the ?rst half of 
the season. The January sign-
ings of mid?elder Philippe 
Coutinho and striker Daniel 
Sturridge reinvigorated Liver-
pool. The team ?nished in a 
respectable seventh position 
— an improvement over the 
previous season — and played 
some wonderful soccer in the 
second half of the season. The 
targets for the next season 
were to qualify for the UEFA 
Champions League and keep 
Suárez at the club.
It’s not the mere fact that 
Liverpool has kept up with its 
targets; it’s the way the team 
did it that is impressive. Car-
roll was sold in the summer, 
and forwards Iago Aspas and 
Luis Alberto were purchased to 
provide backup for Sturridge 
and Suárez. Under-perform-
ing winger Stewart Downing 
was sold to West Ham United, 
and Sterling was given a more 
prominent and regular role 
in the side. Club legend and 
defender Jaime Carragher, 
an important part of the ?rst 
team, retired and new center 
backs Mamadou Sakho, Tiago 
Ilori, and Kolo Touré were 
brought in. The inconsistent 
goalkeeper Pepe Reina was 
loaned out to Napoli, with 
Simon Mignolet brought in 
to replace him. Fullback Aly 
Cissokho and forward Victor 
Moses were brought in on loan 
from Valencia and Chelsea, 
respectively, to provide much-
needed squad depth.
Rodgers had identi?ed 
his targets, done his business 
early, and made sure integral 
new players had a preseason 
to settle in. The Suárez trans-
fer saga was handled admira-
bly well, as Rodgers refused to 
sell his star man despite a bid 
of 40 million pounds ($67 mil-
lion) from Arsenal. Suárez’s 
antics and damaging com-
ments to the media about the 
club were taken seriously, and 
he was asked to train alone 
unless there was a public apol-
ogy, a request to which Suárez 
obliged. It showed an impres-
sive increase in maturity from 
a manager who two years ear-
lier was staving off relegation 
from the Championship. Rod-
gers had clearly recti?ed his 
previous mistakes and learned 
from them.
 Injuries have also not rav-
aged the squad this year like 
last season. Rodgers has seem-
ingly always had a backup 
plan in case one of his men 
went down. Mid?elder Jor-
dan Henderson has ?nally 
emerged and is beginning to 
justify the hefty 20 million 
pounds ($33 million) paid 
for him. With a capable strike 
partner, Suárez has been on 
a tear this season and is cur-
rently the highest scorer in 
any of Europe’s top leagues 
this season. Together, Suárez 
and Sturridge have scored a 
combined 39 goals and are the 
league’s top two scorers. Liv-
erpool’s offense has been phe-
nomenal, with Coutinho and 
Sterling showing impressive 
form and mid?elder Steven 
Gerrard showing no signs of 
aging. The club has scored 66 
goals this season, only two be-
hind league leader Manches-
ter City. Rodgers has made 
Liverpool reach new heights 
in a style all his own.
However, what’s most 
striking about Rodgers this 
season is not his transfer acu-
men or his playing style: Rod-
gers’s tactical innovation has 
never been more apparent. 
With Suárez suspended and 
Coutinho injured early in the 
season, Rodgers was able to 
play a simple 4–3–3 with Ster-
ling and Aspas on the wings 
led by Sturridge and Gerrard, 
defensive mid?elder Lucas 
Leiva, and Henderson in mid-
?eld. The play was promising, 
but the offense was strug-
gling. There was also the issue 
of providing ?ve center backs 
enough playing time to judge 
them and their potential part-
nerships with only two places 
up for grabs. The return of 
Suárez and Coutinho caused 
more tactical conundrums in 
the forward positions.
The solution from Rodgers 
was unique and impressive. In 
response, Rodgers deployed a 
3–4–1–2 formation with three 
center backs from the afore-
mentioned three, center backs 
Martin Škrtel and Daniel Ag-
ger, a mid?eld of Gerrard and 
Lucas, two fullbacks doubling 
as wing backs, and Coutinho 
playing in the No. 10 role be-
hind Suárez and Sturridge. 
The results were phenom-
enal, as Liverpool absolutely 
decimated opponents. Suárez 
had a goal-scoring streak of 
two or more goals for three 
consecutive games.
The system had its ?aws, 
and Rodgers was quick to re-
alize them. In a loss against 
Arsenal in November, the mid-
?eld duo was outnumbered 
and overrun, which resulted 
in Arsenal dominating posses-
sion and dictating the game. 
The 3–4–1–2 formation was 
abandoned, but the ideology 
behind it remained. To play 
Coutinho, Suárez, and Stur-
ridge at the same time would 
require having energetic mid-
?elders to cover more ground 
and make up for the lack of 
defensive pressure exerted by 
the trio. Forced by an injury 
to Lucas, Rodgers decided to 
revert to a 4–4–2 and play 
Gerrard and Henderson in the 
middle while playing Coutin-
ho and Sterling on the ?anks. 
This combination has proven 
to be admirably successful for 
Liverpool as their attack con-
tinues to rack up goals.
Liverpool’s defense re-
mains a major liability, though 
that is mainly because of inju-
ries and a lack of discipline at 
both fullback positions. The 
return of the injured players 
should provide the team a ma-
jor defensive boost. In the 5–1 
win over Arsenal, Liverpool’s 
lightning-fast attacks, using 
the pace of all the attackers, 
caused havoc in the opposition 
defense and led to four goals 
in the opening 20 minutes. It 
was the most exhilarating play 
by any team this season—  the 
result of well-rehearsed set 
pieces and team play.
It’s a testament to Rodg-
ers’s ability as a manager that 
Liverpool has still won all of 
them and is now only four 
points off the top of the table.
Rodgers has displayed 
great tactical awareness, a 
deep transfer insight, and ex-
emplary man management in 
his short career. He has also 
developed a sort of resilience 
in this Liverpool team that 
champions tend to have; the 
club recently came back from 
behind twice in a game at Ful-
ham to score a goal in the 90th 
minute and win 3–2.
His team is adventur-
ous, fearless and raring to 
go against any team in the 
league. Liverpool is on the rise 
again, and it has the Rodgers 
stamp all over it.

minutes for Carnegie Mel-
lon to take its ?rst lead of the 
game on another Meghani 
three-pointer. Emory retook 
the lead with under a minute 
left, but a jump shot by Hill-
man with just over 30 seconds 
to play gave the Tartans a 
44–43 lead at half.
The Tartans kept it close to 
open the second half before 
the Eagles began to pull away. 
Emory had their largest lead at 
16 points with four minutes to 
play, but Carnegie Mellon had 
one last burst to try and win.
Going a 9–0 run, the Tar-
tans cut the lead to seven, but 
the Eagles killed their momen-
tum.Overall, the Tartans kept 
trying to ?ght back, but a blis-
tering 50.7 percent shooting 
from Emory for the game was 
too much to handle as Carn-
egie Mellon fell 100–86.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
made their presence known 
early and often. Senior guard-
forward Christian Manoli 
scored the team’s ?rst ?ve 
points, giving them a 5–2 lead 
they would never relinquish.
First-year forward Jack 
Serbin pushed out the lead 
with a set of three-pointers, 
giving Carnegie Mellon a 
10-point lead.
Rochester got back to with-
in ?ve with just under seven 
minutes to go in the half, but 
10 quick Tartan points, in-
cluding two three-pointers by 
senior guard Rashaun Riley 
pushed the lead back to 11.
In the second half, the Yel-
lowjackets pulled within seven 
points with under two minutes 
to play. They repeatedly fouled 
senior guard-forward Sean 
Brophy in an attempt to make 
a comeback. Brophy went 3–6 
at the line, but his sti?ing de-
fense helped keep the game 
out of reach for Rochester.
Aside from that slight scare 
at the end, the Tartans cruised 
to a relatively easy 73–62 win 
behind 19 points from Cordts 
to lead the team. Serbin ?n-
ished with a double-double 
while leading the team with 
11 rebounds.
For the season, both men’s 
and women’s teams are 11–11, 
with the women 2–9 in UAA 
games, compared to the men’s 
4–7 conference record.

As recently as November, 
Oklahoma State Cowboys 
guard Marcus Smart was the 
king of college basketball. As 
one of the few who denied 
the allure of the NBA to come 
back and play more college 
basketball, Smart was a sure-
?re top-three pick at the end 
of last season, but he decided 
to stay in college for a number 
of reasons.
In an era where NBA play-
ers are only required to attend 
one year of college, stars stay-
ing multiple years is a rarity. 
The money and glamour the 
NBA provides is often enough 
to get many players to leave 
after just one year, especially 
a player with Smart’s talent.
 At the beginning of the 
year, Smart played excel-
lently, surpassing the hype 
surrounding incoming ?rst-
years like Kansas Jayhawks 
forward Andrew Wiggins and 
Duke Blue Devils forward 
Jabari Parker. There was talk 
that the player who decided 
to stay an extra year in college 
could go ?rst in the draft.
As the season progressed, 
however, and as college 
coaches did everything they 
could to stop Smart, they 
slowed his play. He turned 
from an unknown quantity 
with no ceiling to a player of 
measurable talent.
This quantity is not an in-
dictment of the level of bas-
ketball he plays. A known 
quantity, however, always 
seems less valuable than the 
shiny new stars no one really 
knows much about. Smart has 
struggled lately as the season 
comes to a close, and the 
player who was a potential 
top-three pick a season ago 
has been in danger of falling 
outside of the top 10.
Now he’s in danger of fall-
ing out of the ?rst round.
 Smart just received a 
three-game suspension for 
shoving Texas Tech fan Jeff 
Orr as a game drew to a close. 
Two different versions of the 
story exist. Orr claims he 
called Smart a “piece of crap.” 
Smart claims Orr uttered a ra-
cial slur.
The truth is probably 
somewhere in between, but 
no one seems to care. Many 
writers have come down hard 
on Smart, saying the suspen-
sion is not enough. Some even 
say he should be banned from 
the NCAA or forbidden from 
entering the NBA draft. He 
has been painted as a picture 
of the entitlement of college 
basketball players and young 
athletes in general.
These people are missing 
the point. What we do know is 
that someone said something 
unsavory to Smart, who then 
got frustrated and pushed the 
fan. There are two people in-
volved in this story, and most 
people have been focusing on 
the wrong one.
 I’m not going to go into 
detail on Smart’s life story be-
cause it’s not my story to tell. 
What I do know about Smart 
is that he’s 19. I’m also 19. I 
get frustrated and yell when 
I play pick-up games in Wie-
gand Gymnasium. I can’t tell 
how well I would restrain my-
self if my future depended on 
every one of these games.
To put this situation into 
context, a 50-year-old man 
cursed or — if one were to 
believe Smart’s version of the 
story — directed much worse 
language at Smart. The gen-
eral consensus has somehow 
been that Smart did some-
thing horrible and deserves 
punishment. Smart shoving 
a fan looks bad for the game, 
and a small suspension seems 
about right, but why is the fo-
cus on Smart? The absolute 
lack of maturity shown by a 
50-year-old man is a much 
worse transgression than a 
?t of anger from a 19-year-
old. There needs to be some 
recourse against someone 
who decides it is okay to walk 
into an arena where college 
students are competing in an 
extracurricular activity and 
utter a racial slur. Many re-
ports have said Orr told Smart 
to “go back to Africa,” a sen-
tence far more harmful than 
any shove. Language like that 
simply cannot be tolerated, 
and those who react should 
not be scapegoated.
To Orr’s credit, he has 
“suspended” himself for the 
remainder of the season by 
saying that he will not go to 
any more Texas Tech games. 
However, something should 
be done about crowd con-
duct near the court. Racist 
language near the court has 
been an issue in basketball in 
the past, and jawing between 
players and fans is a common 
occurrence. If athletes — es-
pecially college athletes — are 
held to such high standards of 
professionalism, fans should 
be too. Ejections should be 
immediate if of?cials hear dis-
criminatory language based 
on someone’s race, sexual ori-
entation, or other aspects of 
their identity. 
Smart shoving Orr should 
not be seen as a product of the 
entitlement and sel?shness 
of young athletes. It should 
show that athletes are hu-
mans, ones who go through 
the same emotional trials and 
tribulations as everyone else 
as they grow. 
The added pressure of be-
ing nationally visible just adds 
another obstacle, and people 
should be more understand-
ing of incidents like this one. 
If Orr was hurt, I could under-
stand the backlash. But the 
shove was benign: No one was 
injured. Much of the backlash 
feels like it has a racist un-
dertone, and there needs to 
be far more acceptance and 
sympathy shown in similar 
situations.

Swimmers qualify in nine events at UAA Championships
Returning from Emory 
University at the end of 
the weekend, the Carnegie 
Mellon swimming and div-
ing teams were anticipat-
ing NCAA-qualifying cut 
times in nine events at the 
University Athletic Associa-
tion Swimming and Diving 
Championships.
Bad weather in Atlanta 
this week forced some un-
usual scheduling changes 
and delayed the ?nal re-
sults. The three-day cham-
pionship meet, which was 
supposed to have begun on 
Wednesday, was shortened 
to a two-day meet running 
Friday and Saturday. Three 
teams that could not make 
it to Atlanta — Case West-
ern Reserve University, the 
University of Chicago, and 
the University of Rochester 
— competed instead Satur-
day and Sunday at a satel-
lite event at Case Western 
Reserve in Cleveland.
Carnegie Mellon’s teams 
joined the Atlanta event 
with Brandeis University, 
Emory University, New York 
University, and Washington 
University in St. Louis.
The following Tartan 
swimmers recorded provi-
sional cut times: ?rst-year 
Gillian Crews, sophomore 
Alex Dintino, sophomore 
Philip Farr, ?rst-year Dustin

Dif?cult weekend for basketball against two UAA teams
It was an all-around 
rough weekend for the Tar-
tan basketball teams, going 
a combined 1–3 in their two 
doubleheaders against Emory 
University on Friday night and 
University of Rochester Sun-
day afternoon.
“In a non-conference game, 
we have more con?dence and 
we play a lot better,” said ?rst-
year shooting guard Sade 
Idera. “During the University 
Athletic Association [UAA] 
games, the fact that we play 
conferences teams makes 
people nervous and that really 
changes the way that we play. 
We need to get back to the 
way we play non-conference 
games.”
The women’s team has a 
much better record in non-
conference games than UAA 
games. Idera said that the 
team is challenged in UAA 
games because of the play-
ers they face: “You know that 
the person on the other team 
is just as good and works just 
as hard as you,” Idera said. 
“But you have to remember 
that you need to win because 
you’ve worked so hard for it. 
Sometimes, players don’t re-
member that and that’s what 
causes us to mess up.”
Both UAA games for the 
Carnegie Mellon women start-
ed with ?rst half leads. Against 
Emory, the Tartans took the 
lead with senior guard Jacquie 
Shaw giving them a quick 6–2 
lead. Carnegie Mellon was 
dominant inside, collecting 
several offensive rebounds in 
the ?rst few minutes. First-
year forward-center Lisa Mur-
phy was destroying Emory in 
the paint, recording a double-
double and leading the team 
with 28 points and 13
 rebounds.
The Tartans took a slim one 
point lead into halftime given 
by sophomore guard Lindsay 
Poss’s two free throws with 
just under a minute remain-
ing. Through the ?rst nine 
minutes of the second half the 
teams remained close, alter-
nating leads and ties.
Slowly Emory established 
a small lead based on several 
Tartan turnovers forced by the 
Eagles’ quick hands, record-
ing a steal for each of their 
turnovers, and a bombard-
ment of three-pointers. Down 
the stretch, Emory made its 
free throws and put the game 
away, cruising to a 87–76 win.
Sunday was a different sto-
ry against Rochester, but the 
same ending for the women. 
Starting off slow, the Tartans 
didn’t grab a lead until junior 
guard Chandler Cau?eld hit a 
three pointer with just under 
10 minutes remaining in the 
half.
From there, Carnegie Mel-
lon took control grabbing a 
nine point lead at half time, 
and stretching out to a 42–28 
advantage just over two min-
utes into the second half. 
The Yellowjackets came back 
strong, eventually tying the 
score at 49.
“We started off really well, 
but we just didn’t ?nish the 
game well,” Idera said. “We 
began with so much energy, 
and it just dwindled as the 
game went on. If we had kept 
up our energy, I think we 
would’ve won.”
Shaw gave the Tartans the 
lead again late in the half, but 
Rochester took the lead for 
good with just of three min-
utes to play. Unlike Emory, the 
Yellowjackets missed several 
free throws down the stretch 
to give the Tartans a chance, 
but they were just unable to 
convert.
“It takes a lot of concentra-
tion and a lot of great lead-
ership. We have all of those 
things, it’s just a matter of 
making sure that we know 
how to use them,” Idera said.
After the game Shaw 
said, “While this season has 
been tough, we are building 
a strong foundation for us to 
build on going into next year.”
Idera agreed, saying that 
for the Carnegie Mellon men, 
it was the tale of Dr. Jekyll and 
Mr. Hyde between Friday and 
Sunday. Against Emory, the 
Tartans started off slow, fall-
ing behind by double digits 
with less than eight minutes to

SPORTS COMMENTARY
Player sexuality should be a non-issue
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
Last Sunday, recent Uni-
versity of Missouri graduate 
Michael Sam openly admit-
ted he was gay. Sam hadn’t 
really tried to hide his sexual-
ity, coming out to many of his 
close friends last August. They 
had respected his privacy and 
let Sam come out in his own 
time.
Stories similar to Sam’s are 
happening all across the na-
tion, as individuals gain the 
con?dence to fully admit their 
sexuality and gender 
preferences. 
Given the rising accep-
tance of the LGBTQ commu-
nity, these moments, while 
incredibly meaningful to the 
individual, barely make a rip-
ple for society as a whole. 
But one thing makes Sam’s 
story different. Sam is a pros-
pect for the NFL.
Sam played defensive end 
for the Missouri Tigers until 
his graduation in December 
2013. Before his coming-out 
announcement, he was pro-
jected to be a third- to ?fth-
round draft pick after being 
named top SEC Defensive 
Player of the Year and an All-
American for his senior season 
with the Tigers. 
Now Sam is the owner of 
a more lofty title — the ?rst 
openly gay NFL prospect and, 
assuming he isn’t completely 
shut out, the ?rst openly gay 
NFL player. 
Sam’s announcement took 
the media by storm, taking 
over sports coverage for the 
NFL in what was supposed to 
be one of its few media dead 
periods of the year. 
Much of the discussion sur-
rounded the idea that many 
teams would not draft Sam 
because of his sexuality, and 
the media circus that would 
surround the controversy.
Longtime NFL reporter 
Peter King interviewed four 
NFL front-of?ce members 
anonymously to try and get a 
non-sugar-coated version of 
their thoughts for his website, 
The MMQB with Peter King. 
One of the general managers, 
when asked explicitly if he 
though Sam would get draft-
ed, said “No.” He believed that 
the impact on the locker room 
would be far too great for a 
middling talent like Sam. 
The very clear counter-
argument to the manager’s 
argument is, why did the Ti-
gers — with Sam openly com-
ing out to the team before the 
start of this season — have 
debatably their best year in 
school history? 
I’m not saying there might 
not be some rough patches in 
the NFL, but I ?nd it comical 
to believe a team will have its 
entire season derailed because 
of one openly gay teammate in 
the locker room. 
The real story here is the 
fact that there is a story. 
Sports is unequivocally tied to 
society, although previously it 
was seen as progressive. 
The integration of baseball 
with Jackie Robinson back in 
1947 is pointed to as one of 
the de?ning moments in the 
march to civil rights. But here 
we are, in 2014: New states 
are ratifying gay marriage and 
rights, and the Supreme Court 
overturned Proposition 8 to 
further push the LGBTQ com-
munity to equal rights and 
status. Meanwhile, the NFL 
— and sports in general — is 
holding us back.
I would like to think we 
have come far enough as a 
society for the sexual prefer-
ences of a sports ?gure to not 
de?ne our level of acceptance 
as a community. Professional 
sports is supposedly one of 
the last arenas where success 
is based solely on talent, skill, 
and merit. 
The NFL has shown an 
amazing ability to overlook a 
player’s past if he can still con-
tribute on the ?eld. 
Michael Vick was wel-
comed back to the league with 
open arms after spending time 
in jail for dog ?ghting charges 
because he could still fool 
defenders with both his arm 
and his legs. Baltimore Ra-
vens’ great Ray Lewis was cel-
ebrated by his team even after 
he was implicated in murder 
charges at the start of his ca-
reer following Baltimore’s Su-
per Bowl win back in 2001. 
The fact that Sam — or 
his counterpart in the NBA, 
previous Washington Wizards 
center Jason Collins — might 
not get to play the sport he 
has dedicated his life to just 
because of who he chooses 
to love is abhorrent. Sam’s 
sexuality shouldn’t be a story, 
maybe a news blurb at most. 
Instead, hours of media cover-
age are being devoted to what 
should be a non-issue. 
Change is hard. Societal in-
ertia is one of the most power-
ful forces we face as a commu-
nity. But this level of coverage 
and discussion is completely 
unwarranted. 
Sam should be applauded 
for being the ?rst, because he 
has chosen to challenge the 
system. He took the ?rst step 
to making this a non-issue, but 
clearly the media and the NFL 
have shown us we have a long 
way to go.

Glitch Mob’s latest has a glitch
Love Death Immortality overuses the group’s craftier formulas
Who remembers Florence and the Machine’s 
sophomore album, Ceremonials? Hardly any of 
you? Well, to recap, it was okay, but it didn’t come 
anywhere close to matching her spine-tingling 
debut Lungs. Like all artists, Florence wanted to 
better herself, so for Ceremonials, she took what her 
fans and producers liked best — loud, theatrical, 
gut-wrenching anthems — and made an album 
chock-full of them. And though the album didn’t 
flop, only the hit single, “Shake It Out,” lives to tell 
the tale.
The Glitch Mob — made up of Los Angeles EDM 
veterans edIT, Boreta, and Ooah — tried the same 
thing for Love Death Immortality, but with even less 
success. They took their most crafty and powerful 
moments from their glorious first album, Drink the 
Sea, and beat the listener over the head with them. 
Some tracks are pretty damn fun on their own, but 
after the third or fourth, the album is all climax and 
no sexual tension.
As anyone can glean from the laughably ambitious 
title and sick cover art, The Glitch Mob took the 
adage “go big or go home” quite literally with Love 
Death Immortality. Like Beyoncé, every track has a 
music video to match, but it looks like they didn’t 
have Queen B’s budget: Each video finds some 
mix between a bizarre iTunes Visualizer mod and 
a Rorschach test. They even provided a second 
version of the album with commentary before each 
track elucidating how and where and why it was 
made, probably thinking that it would be beneficial 
to their given audience or that we would care. It’s 
not, and we don’t.
Again like Ceremonials, the single The Glitch Mob 
released a month before Love Death Immortality 
came out is by far the most redeeming track. Like 
everything on the album, “Can’t Kill Us” sounds 
overblown and raucous, but it actually succeeds in 
being an improvement from most selections on the 
previous album, vying for the “most epic” award 
with Drink the Sea’s big hit “Animus Vox.”
On the opposite end of the spectrum, “Skytoucher” 
is six minutes of aimless synth melody over a 
headache-inducing pad. Also, apparently, its proper 
genre descriptor is “brostep.” Why would anyone 
want to listen to anything called “brostep?”
“Our Demons” is pretty great too; it doesn’t give 
everything away near the beginning, which most 
of their tracks seem to do, and it has some more 
organic-sounding loops, adding some contrast to 
the drum-and-bass-laden rest of the album. Aja 
Volkman’s guest vocals work well here, but not so 
much in her other appearance, “I Need Your Memory 
Back,” another arc-less effort: Her opening vocals 
lead up to a rather disappointing synth lick that 
belongs in a game of Tetris, and it goes downhill 
from there.
The Tetris synth makes a return in the harmonically 
uninteresting and reverb-heavy “Fly By Night Only,” 
but Yaarrohs’s smooth guest vocals work really well 
with The Glitch Mob. Hopefully, they take her back 
on their next album.
The music on Love Death Immortality is obviously 
geared toward the crowd at the club, and while fans 
of Drink the Sea might pout, they can’t be too upset 
about that. The money’s not in the album sales, but 
in the live shows; Love Death Immortality basically 
functions as an advert for filling a venue. But the 
crowd that responds to the ad will probably show up 
for “Can’t Kill Us,” get bored, and leave.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Ryan and Matt,
I came back to my 
apartment on Valentine’s 
Day to hear “Lady 
Marmalade” by Patti 
LaBelle on repeat blasting 
on my stereo. I live 
alone, and I don’t have 
a girlfriend, nor does 
anyone I know have a 
key. I have no idea what 
was going on. I’m as 
much a fan of asking 
girls to sleep with me in 
French as the next guy, 
but the whole experience 
really freaked me out. I 
thought ghosts were only 
supposed to show up on 
Halloween.

Dear ROMANCED,
Seriously dude, you still have 
a stereo system? Was the 
song playing off a cassette 
tape? Questions aside, 
our only theory is close to 
yours: You might have a 
spurned ex-lover looking 
for revenge. By ex-lover, we 
mean — how to put this — 
an expired lover. You might 
want to contact the friends 
of all of your girls in the past 
to make sure they are okay. 
It might be a little awkward 
checking in with them so 
soon after Valentine’s Day, 
but you never know, at least 
one of their new boyfriends 
is bound to have screwed 
up, and they could be in a 
nostalgic kind of mood.

Hey Matt and Ryan,
I met up with some 
friends for an anti-
Valentine’s Day party on 
Friday night, and I had 
a great time. It started 
with the ice cream-
eating contest, and the 
night quickly moved on 
to Mario Kart. After the 
video games, we went 
exploring, and got in deep 
trouble with scary guys 
stealing cars. At first, they 
took us under their wing, 
but then they betrayed us 
to the mob and left us all 
for dead. Ultimately, we 
worked our way up the 
criminal hierarchy, and 
now I want out.
Any advice?

Are you sure you all weren’t

Do we even have a mob in

pillbox 02.17.14
This past weekend the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre 
collaborated with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra 
(PSO) to put on the classical ballet favorite Swan Lake, 
staged by artistic director Terrence S. Orr.
The production was a visual splendor of white tulle 
that would make any aspiring dancer, elementary-aged 
and beyond, gasp with envy. The ballet immersed the 
audience in the fairytale world with rich orchestral 
accompaniment, magical set pieces, and even a few 
tastefully dramatic lightning ?ashes for effect. The stage 
was transformed from palace courtyard to dreamlike 
forest, juxtaposing the world of people with the wonders 
of nature. The dancers brought not only precision 
and poise, but an emotional energy that transformed 
the ballet from a showcase of remarkable skill into an 
emotional performance.
One of the few ballets to have entered popular culture 
and knowledge, Swan Lake encapsulates everything that 
one could want from a tragic love story. A discontent 
Prince Siegfried falls in love with beautiful maiden 
Odette, only to discover that she has been cursed by an 
evil sorcerer to transform into a swan in daylight. Only 
the prince’s true love and betrothal to her can remove 
the curse. Prince Siegfried returns home but is desperate 
to see his lover. 
Meanwhile, the evil sorcerer devises a plan to make sure 
Odette remains in his power. The clever villain deceives 
Prince Siegfried into thinking that his own daughter, 
Odile, is the prince’s love, leading to inevitable emotional 
turmoil for the lovers who jump off a cliff, one and then 
the other, only to ?nally be together in heaven. Within 
this simple story is a number of interpretations and 
re?ections, with themes of forbidden love, entrapment, 
and psychosis.
Originally choreographed by Marius Petipa in the 
latter half of the 19th century, the ballet’s most iconic 
scenes are those with the identical white swans 
in perfect harmony — symbols of pure naturalistic 
beauty. Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre made these moments 
highlights. The dancers felt uni?ed as they worked to 
create visual illusions and compositions, moving as one 
body to pull the audience from their own lives into the 
magic of the ballet The role of Odette was danced to 
perfection by the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre’s principal 
dancer, Julia Erickson, during the Thursday opening. 
The ability of the ballerina to express such complex 
emotions within the limits of the choreography requires 
tremendous physical and mental capacity, as well as the 
careful control of every part of the body, to communicate 
the psychological journey.
The lead role of Odette must also play the deceitful 
sorcerer’s daughter Odile, thus requiring a dancer able 
to express the personality of two characters within 
the same ballet. Erickson embodied both the ethereal 
character of Odette and the seductive personality of 
Odile with expressive yet economic movements.
Though the dancing took center stage, the PSO’s 
interpretation of Tchaikovsky’s score was equally 
masterful. Between the music and dancing, the 
performance was fully immersive.
Though Swan Lake is certainly nothing new, it speaks to 
complex human struggles that are consistently relevant 
across time and culture. The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre’s 
performance of the classic is a reminder that perhaps the 
reason such works of art have withstood the test of time 
is because they speak to a deep human desire for magic, 
love, and an escape from reality.

Judas Iscariot explores self-improvement
Scotch’n’Soda production is an irreverent courtroom drama that prompts deep thought
“You broke me un?xable,” states the titular Judas Iscariot 
in The Last Days of Judas Iscariot, Scotch’n’Soda’s latest 
production. This play is an irreverent play about religion, 
guilt, and forgiveness, written by Stephen Adly Guirgis 
and directed by junior history and English double major 
Razghiem Golden with assistance from junior Bachelor of 
Humanities and Arts student in architecture and ethics, 
history, and public policy Anna Failla.
The play starts as a stereotypical courtroom drama in 
purgatory at the appeal trial of Judas Iscariot, played by 
senior psychology major Wyatt D’Emilia. Plucky lawyer 
Fabiana Aziza Cunningham (junior dramaturgy major 
Jacqueline Mishol), rises to the challenge to defend the 
traitor apostle. However, she and the entire courtroom 
get more than they bargained for as the play develops 
into a genre of its own.
The Last Days of Judas Iscariot, which is set in 
purgatory, depicts an interesting version of the afterlife. 
According to the play, purgatory changes its appearance 
according to the times. In this case, the afterlife is 
Americanized. There are biblical characters speaking 
with New York accents and historical ?gures who dress 
like Al Pacino.
A few of the play’s many memorable characters include 
Fabiana, purgatory’s Perry Mason whose dark past 
is gradually revealed. The Judge, as played by senior 
Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in music 
and creative writing James Alexander, is a former 
Civil War soldier with a southern drawl and a cynical, 
in?exible worldview. Sophomore materials science 
and engineering major Yeshar Hadi puts on plenty of 
hammy and smarmy as he portrays prosecutor Yusef 
El-Fayoumy. Satan, as played by senior Bachelor of 
Computer Science and Arts student Andrew Bueno, is 
a wildcard character who can be as suave as he can be 
sadistic. And, of course, there is the infamous Judas 
Iscariot.
Along with the colorful cast, there is plenty of colorful 
language. In fact, there is very colorful language, as well 
as a few offensive jokes; this is not a play to show in 
Sunday school.
The Last Days of Judas Iscariot is also interspersed with 
monologues taken from various Biblical characters, 
including Mary Magdalene (?rst-year architecture major 
Victoria Yong), Saint Monica (?rst-year undeclared 
Dietrich College of Humanities & Social Sciences 
student Maggie Davis), and Saint Thomas (?rst-year 
chemistry major Ryan LaPré). For the most part, these 
monologues serve to segue between portions of the play 
and re-emphasize its themes. However, these sequences 
can seem out of place at times, especially since most of 
these characters do not appear in any other instances.
The play becomes more interesting as it progresses. 
The beginning doesn’t seem to take itself very seriously; 
it acts as a parody of the legal system and the Bible as 
caricatures of historical ?gures come and go. However, 
the play hits its stride in the latter parts. Characters’ 
motivations are more developed, more serious 
philosophical ideas are discussed, and some of the more 
unique concepts come into the foreground.
For the majority of the play, Judas sits alone in his 
personal, chilly hell at one end of the stage, and only 
comes out of it in ?ashbacks — once when he is a child 
and once when he is drunk. The only information the 
audience gains about him is what has been said by other 
characters. But at the very end there is a glimpse of the 
real Judas and why he is truly stuck in hell, as Jesus 
tries to comfort him. One of the most interesting features 
of the play is the dual casting of the same character as 
Satan and Jesus. It adds much more weight and thought 
to the ?nal scenes.
Susanna Seltzer, a sophomore international relations and 
politics major, said of the play, “I thought it was a great 
play, expertly done, and it balanced comedy and tragedy 
beautifully.”
“I loved it. I thought what was most impressive was the 
actor who played Satan/Jesus, especially the transition 
between the really funny and really serious parts,” said 
Kabir Mantha, a ?rst-year math major. “Judas was also 
amazing, as well as the Judge, and Fabiana. I was really 
surprised by how good it was. The last Scotch’n’Soda 
production I saw was Batboy, but this could easily be 
confused as a School of Drama production.”
There were also many other features unique to this 
production. The set design was innovative; the stage 
was open from all sides, and actors could enter or exit 
from almost anywhere. The set itself was a courtroom 
in purgatory, and featured an interesting clash between 
symbols of heaven and hell. Unfortunately the seating 
and venue did not accommodate the set well. The venue, 
Rangos 3, was completely ?lled by the stage and seats, 
and if you were unlucky enough to get a seat in the 
second or third rows, many times you saw more of the 
person sitting in front of you than the set or the actors. 
A larger room could have gone a long way in resolving 
these issues.
When the production was ?nished, there was also a 
special talkback session, in which the production staff, 
actors, and faculty who did work relating to the subject 
matter of the play held a panel discussion on some of the 
themes, history, and ideas behind it.
Although Nietzsche famously declared “God is dead” 
more than 100 years ago, plays such as The Last Days of 
Judas Iscariot show that God, religion, and Christianity 
are still subjects of lively discussion in society. What this 
play brings to the table is an attempt to reconcile the 
many interpretations of religious scripture and come up 
with one solid answer to how people can best improve 
themselves. The Scotch’n’Soda production does an 
excellent job of picking at all the ideas behind the play 
while providing sharp comedy and intense drama.

The School of Drama premiered an original, student-
written play on Wednesday. The Last Page: A Nuclear 
Folktale, written and directed by senior directing major 
Samuel French, tells the story of the pursuit of the 
American dream in a post-apocalyptic world. 
Junior acting major David Patterson played Soldier — 
circa the Revolutionary War — who, when in search of 
water, meets Little Girl, played by junior musical theatre 
major Alexis Floyd, looking for her mother. The two 
become friends when Little Girl shows Soldier that her 
veins are ?lled with water because her heart is a storm 
cloud. In their search for her mother, they come across 
Fox, played by junior acting major Mitchell Edwards, and 
Crow, played by junior acting major Olivia Brown, who 
are in search of water. Fox and Crow steal the little girl’s 
heart while she sleeps. 
Meanwhile, two destructive boy gods, Plutonium, played 
by junior musical theatre major Phillippe Arroyo, and 
Uranium, played by junior acting major Jeremy Hois, 
steal the crown of a riddle-solving Statue, who is also 
played by Brown. Without the crown, Little Girl can’t 
solve the riddle that would start the earth spinning again 
after the apocalypse, so Soldier and Little Girl go looking 
for it.
After the show, the cast and crew sat down with 
audience members for a talkback to get viewers’ 
reactions to the play and explain some of the behind-the-
scenes processes of making the play.
“It’s a very Americana play,” French said. “As we 
discussed this idea more and more, we realized that 
American ideas are actually a gateway to global ideas. 
How the Fox and the Crow interact with the American 
dream is the idea of ‘go out and grab what you want for 
yourself’ and ‘do whatever it takes to survive’ mentality, 
and how the Little Girl and the Soldier interact with the 
American dream juxtaposes that.”
The scenery was meant to re?ect the idea of the 
American dream. Sections of chipped white picket 
fences were the only scenery on the stage. The black 
?oor also had ?ecks of colors on it meant to make it 
resemble a galaxy. “I was trying to ?nd some symbol 
of Americana, so we used the white picket fence, and 
the ?oor was meant to re?ect the cosmic relativity of 
the play,” said junior scenic design major and the play’s 
scenic designer Pia Marchetti. “But when I saw the 
lighting, that’s when I started to see everything come 
together. It gave the feel of an abyss or a haze.”
The lighting signi?cantly added to the tone of the play, 
and changes in the lighting helped the audience to 
recognize breaks in the story and movement through 
scenes. A smoky haze ?lled the theater when the 
audience ?rst arrived, adding a mysterious aura before 
the play started. “I was hesitant when I ?rst read the 
script because one scene took place in the stars; the 
next was in the desert,” said junior lighting design 
major and the play’s lighting designer Rane Renshaw. 
“The set allowed me to create room and have you ?oat 
at times, be dehydrated at times, be in a kingdom at 
times. Behind you extended forever, which added to 
that idea of in?nite time, in?nite space. When they 
were wandering through the desert, the lighting felt 
dehydrated, and gave me the opportunity to emphasize 
that, and allow you to connect the dots.”
In addition to the aesthetic features of the play, the 
actors brought the otherwise confusing story to life. 
Especially delightful was Floyd’s portrayal of Little Girl. 
Comical at times, tear-jerking at others, and always 
vibrant, Floyd’s animated performance was captivating 
and was sure to make each member of the audience 
invested in her journey to ?nd her heart, her mother, and 
Statue’s crown.
“When I ?rst read it, I actually didn’t immediately get 
the sense of the American dream,” Floyd said. “What 
resonated with me were the characters. As we started 
to work on the play, I realized the Girl represented 
being attached to the American dream and to have the 
resources to go after what you want. She has faith in her 
that anything is possible.”
During the talkback session, some audience members 
expressed that they thought of Little Girl as a 
representation of an angel. “I have personal feelings 
about this, but at times she is an angel, whatever that 
means,” French said. “Her costume changed how I 
started to think of Little Girl. Eunjin Lee came to me 
with the idea of her costume looking like a quilt. It’s 
something that is handed down from generation to 
generation. What she could be and what she was is 
something I’m not going to disclose.” Lee is the show’s 
costume designer and is pursuing a masters in costume 
design. 
While Little Girl seemed to be a very universal character 
whose time period would be dif?cult to pinpoint, 
Soldier belonged to a very de?nite time period — the 
Revolutionary War. French said he chose to make 
him a soldier from that particular war because, “That 
was the start of America, when the American ideals 
originated that have been twisted, distorted, changed. 
That was when the ideal was most powerful. I chose a 
Revolutionary War soldier because he was a soldier that 
started there and saw how the country changed.”
Though the story was certainly creative and engaging, it 
was also very confusing at times. Because the characters 
were from such different worlds, time periods, and 
levels of believability, the story was often dif?cult to 
follow. The actors and lighting de?nitely helped, but 
did not eliminate all confusion. Overall, the play was an 
intriguing story and a unique experience.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for the House of 
Cards season two premiere, “Happy Birthday Mr. (Vice) 
President.”
“You didn’t think I’d forgotten about you, did you? 
Welcome back,” drawls former House Majority Whip 
Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) of Net?ix’s House of 
Cards. With that, the ?rst episode of season two comes 
to a close and the race to the end of the season is on 
once again.
House of Cards’s wildly successful ?rst season set a 
precedent for Net?ix-exclusive TV series, proving that 
it was possible to captivate even a limited viewership 
given the right ingredients. It is indisputable that 
Net?ix and House of Cards creator Beau Willimon have 
concocted the perfect recipe: complicated plotlines, a 
brilliant cast, and a slew of talented directors. After the 
whirlwind that was the ?rst season, the cast and crew of 
the series had quite a lot to measure up to. But even in 
the ?rst episode of the second season, it’s clear that the 
next 13 chapters that await viewers will leave them on 
the edge of their seats.
The ?rst episode, titled “Happy Birthday Mr. (Vice) 
President,” picks up minutes after season one ended. 
Without missing a beat, viewers are tossed back into the 
thick of things.
Reporters Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), Janine Skorsky 
(Constance Zimmer), and Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian 
Arcelus) are still in the midst of their frantic investigation 
into the death of Congressman Peter Russo (Corey Stoll). 
They’re getting closer to connecting the dots, realizing 
that there is a wealth of evidence that implicates 
Frank, despite the police report that claims that Peter 
committed suicide.
Meanwhile, Frank is in the middle of ascending to the 
vice presidency and ?nding a replacement for his now 
vacant Whip position, all the while keeping his allies 
close and his enemies closer. His wife, Claire (Robin 
Wright), decisively resolves the lawsuit that former 
employee and expectant mother Gillian Cole (Sandrine 
Holt) is bringing against Claire’s nonpro?t for wrongful 
termination. Using Gillian’s pregnancy to blackmail 
her into taking over for Claire at the nonpro?t, Claire 
coldly ends that chapter of her life in order to pour more 
effort into dealing with the media fallout that often 
accompanies Frank’s brutal scheming and politicking.
Frank’s chief of staff Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly) 
continues to run around and take care of all of Frank’s 
dirty work, which includes making sure that Rachel 
Posner (Rachel Brosnahan), ex-prostitute and pawn in 
Peter’s death, stays quiet and out of sight.
The episode is equal parts set-up material for the second 
season and standalone action. Instead of easing viewers 
into season two with a buffer episode, the show takes 
off almost immediately, making watchers feel as though 
they never left this fast-paced political thriller. This pace 
was a good decision since it’s been a year since season 
one was released,which means it could have been a full 
year since Net?ix users saw it.
House of Cards is not for the faint of heart, and 
Willimon issues a reminder that the series is a force 
to be reckoned with when, near the end of the season 
premiere, Frank kills Zoe when he ?nds out that she 
is close to ?nding out the truth behind Peter’s murder. 
Such a strong start indicates that this season will be 
?lled with even more shadowy secrets and dark deeds 
than the last.
Net?ix announced on Feb. 4 that House of Cards was 
renewed for a third season to be released in 2015. 
Considering that Time magazine reported nearly 15 
percent of Net?ix’s 40.4 million viewers watched the 
second season premiere within six hours of its release, 
it’s clear that by renewing this gem of a show, they’re 
not taking a gamble.

In the midst of the AIDS epidemic of the 
1980s, cowboy Ron Woodruff (Matthew 
McConaughey) is living the high life: lots 
of drugs, sex, and booze. Wanting to be 
the manly rodeo cowboy that he is, Ron 
is strongly homophobic and is therefore 
shocked when he contracts the HIV 
virus. In a desperate struggle of survival, 
Ron begins smuggling unapproved drugs 
and selling them to other AIDS victims. 
In a sudden career twist, McConaughey 
sheds his beach-boy persona and 
gives one of the best performances of 
his career. He carries the ?lm with the 
support of the amazing Jared Leto, who 
plays a HIV-positive transsexual woman 
(and a shoo-in for an Oscar). This is not a 
fairytale ?lm with happy endings; but it’s 
full of uplifting courage and strength that 
will send jitters down your spine.

12 Years a Slave
Saturday, Feb. 22 — 11
Sunday, Feb. 23 — 8
In one of the best ?lms of the year, 
director Steve McQueen ruthlessly 
captures the true story of Solomon 
Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free man in 
New York in the 1840s who is a gifted 
musician and carpenter with a family by 
his side. However, in a cruel twist of fate, 
he is captured and forced to work as a 
slave on a plantation in New Orleans. Depicting a true test of survival, 12 Years
 a Slave shows the cruel beginnings 
of American history and humanity. 
McQueen’s visceral style creates a 
documentary-like feel, making it hard to 
watch at times, but it’s a courageous and 
truthful account of one man’s journey 
during a devastating time in history.

Saturday night was the premiere and only night 
of Carnegie Mellon’s biggest annual fashion show, 
Lunar Gala, featuring dazzling designs created and 
modeled entirely by students. The theme this year was 
“Hypnôse,” with the tagline: “The Illusion is Beautiful.” 
The title and description ?t the replaying eerie video 
that began with a girl standing alone in a wintry forest 
staring curiously at what appeared to be a multicolored 
hologram. Only with the culmination of the show did 
the audience discover what happened to the girl when 
she stepped into the hologram: her image became a 
series of hallucinations and warped images, meant to 
represent the inspiration for this year’s Lunar Gala. The 
show itself was grand, complete with high-energy dance 
performances from Carnegie Mellon’s very own Infra 
Dance Company and SoulStylz, as well as a catalog with 
descriptions of each line.
The show began with a DJ playing energetic music, after 
which the video ?ashed on the screen and the crowd 
erupted into applause and shouts. The ?rst line displayed 
was titled “Cocoon” and was designed by sophomore 
design major Miriam Buchwald, who explains in the 
show’s magazine how the inspiration for her looks came 
from the unraveling of a cocoon. The series of delicate 
white dresses and gowns appeared angelic on stage, 
and seemed to include many different textures. It was 
most shocking, then, that each beautiful dress had been 
crafted completely from hot glue. The designer’s talent 
was apparent in the intricacies of each design, and how 
each look was unique, despite having been made from 
the same material.
Once “Cocoon” ended, there was a quick transition 
to the next line, “Saint Knox,” signaled by a change 
in music and pattern of lights on the light-board from 
which the models emerged.
The looks featured in “Saint Knox,” designed by junior 
design majors Keith Joseph and Hayden Smith, were 
more casual and edgy than the ?rst line. In stark contrast 
to the delicate white dresses of the ?rst line, the simple 
black or grey out?ts were unique, often with sheer 
or entirely removed sleeves. The designers de?nitely 
achieved their goal of creating “an easy-going line of 
modern street wear,” as described in the magazine.
From the next line “Fjortis,” the most memorable aspect 
was the light display on the board under which the 
models entered. Setting the scene for designer senior 
decision science major Anna Cederquist’s vision, 
as described in the program, of combining “what is 
considered mature and childish” was a light design with 
bright colors and images that danced along the light 
board in tune to the fun, upbeat music. The designs 
themselves matched the theme, with silhouettes 
that appeared adult-like and accented with small, 
unexpected bursts of neon and childlike patterns.
Junior design major Liana Kong’s “Heteroptera” was 
next on stage. Citing her inspiration as the book 
Heteroptera by Cornelia Hesse-Honegger, Kong created 
an alternate environment through her use of geometric 
shapes and mixes of textures such as leather and tulle. 
Purposeful cutouts and rips accentuated her theme of 
human destruction. This line was followed by “Biome,” 
created by ?fth-year architecture major Ying Lin, junior 
mechanical engineering major Josh Lopez-Binder, and 
?fth-year architecture major Paulina Reyes. Intricate 
patterns representative of the computational design 
involved in the creation of this line were juxtaposed 
against soft, wispy dresses.
Like its mysterious name, “Senhua” was intriguing 
with three-dimensional shapes, laser cut designs, and 
eccentric materials such as plastic. The designers — 
sophomore design major Chloe Chia, junior design 
major Alex Kane, and sophomore Bachelors of Computer 
Science and Arts student in computer science and 
design Jessica Shen — emphasized the importance 
Lunar Gala proves Carnegie Mellon gets fashion
The annual spectacle showcases student-designed collections and models
                  Abhinav Gautam | Staff Photographer
by Nikita Mishra | Staffwriter[]of balance in their line. The product of a trio majoring 
in varying disciplines, “Senhua” was a combination 
of various techniques and styles, tied together by a 
playful-yet-serious vibe. The differences and similarities 
in design worked to make the looks that were displayed 
visually appealing.
Everything in Lunar Gala was the result of careful 
planning and consideration, including the order in 
which the different lines were displayed. Though it was 
obvious that each fashion line tied into the Hypnôse 
theme by playing with texture and pattern, it was also 
noticeable that each line seamlessly transitioned into 
the next. While three-dimensional shapes characterized 
“Senhua,” the next line, “Dilate,” placed emphasis on 
light. The line’s designers — sophomore industrial 
design major Gina Huang, sophomore communication 
design major Irene Joung, and sophomore ?ne arts major 
Angelina Namkung — achieved this emphasis through 
3-D elements such as a string of light bulbs hanging 
around the model’s neck, or a few light bulbs dangling 
off a pyramid-shaped hat.
From one line based on light came another called 
“Lumi,” though this type of light came in the form of 
small LED bulbs that the models could control with 
Bluetooth technology. Through this line, designers 
sophomore art major Christin Bongiorni and senior 
business administration major Mia Skinner achieved 
their goal of fusing technology with fashion. This 
line was indescribably enjoyable to watch, due to the 
interplay between the lights and music.
Third-year architecture majors Shivani Jain and 
Jacqueline Yeung’s line, “Mureaux,” focused on what 
they described in the program as “extrusions of the 
body.” Most memorable from this line were the peculiar 
shapes in mostly neutral colors, accented by pieces 
in gold. This line easily transitioned to third-year 
architecture major Colleen Clifford’s “Capsaicin,” which 
was simultaneously simple and modern, marked by 
reusability of different fabrics.
Then came the futuristic neon plastics with junior 
design majors Samantha Chiu and Antonio Ono’s “UV,” 
followed by ?rst-year design major Eileen Huang’s 
“Youth.” While “UV” was more futuristic and revealing, 
“Youth” was, as its name indicates, more childish with 
items such as a pair of neon pink overalls.
Like many of the lines that incorporated technology 
with fashion, the next line, “Errorz” was inspired by 
a type of music, as described by designers junior 
human-computer interaction and design double major 
Aya Demler and junior mechanical engineering and 
robotics double major Rick Shanor. They explained that 
they utilized inspiration from the stages of electronic 
dance music, concerts to create their looks. The models 
strode onto the stage wearing designs reminiscent of 
Transformers, featuring geometric shapes that lit up to 
the beat of the music. Fourth-year architecture major 
Vishaal Dokras’s line “Vagoba” followed. The line was 
a modern take on the British invasion of India. Junior 
design majors Susan Park and Jane Yoon’s “Avalokita” 
came next. This line was inspired by a Buddhist god. 
The repetition in patterns and contrast in layers made 
“Avalokita” visually appealing. Most memorable was the 
moment when the models all stood at the edge of the 
stage and bowed to the audience.
The show ended with “Spectral Discord,” another line 
that focused on pattern repetition, though in this case 
the designer, junior design major Rachel Ciavarella, 
stated in the magzine that she drew her inspiration 
from “excessive media exposure.” There was then an 
atmosphere of celebration as all the people involved in 
Lunar Gala strode out onto the stage and were greeted 
by wild applause from the audience for their hard work 
and dedication to the show. Lunar Gala is a spectacle 
that every Carnegie Mellon student must experience at 
least once in his or her years here.
