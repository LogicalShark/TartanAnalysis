BAESINGER ELECTED 
SENIOR PRESIDENT
SCIENCE CLASS CHOOSES OFFI­
CERS FOR LAST TIME.
After a rather spirited meeting last 
Friday, the Science Senior class finally 
chose its officers for the ensuing year. 
The chief interest, of course, centered 
about the presidency. The entire 
election for this office was carried on 
by means of ballotting. On the first of 
these, nominations were made and the

names of the ten nominees were post­
ed. It was agreed that only four men 
should survive the second ballot, but 
a tie necessitated the listing of five for 
the next vote, after which two more 
were excluded. Then the third con­
tender was eliminated and the final 
count resulted in the election of Harry
D. Balsinger, of Ebensburg, Pa., for 
president, and Fred C. Ziesenheim, of 
North Girard, Pa., who received the 
second highest vote, for vice president.
Balsinger, a member of the Mechan­
ical Engineering class, needs little in­
troduction to the students. He is a 
member of the Seannachie Society and 
of Sigma Tau Fraternity. He was 
president of his Plebe class, vice pres­
ident of the Board of Control of the 
Athletic Association in his Junior 
year, and is one of the Senior Student 
Welfare Committee. He played half 
back on the Varsity football team dur­
ing his Plebe and Junior years and is 
holding the same position this season. 
The Senior president should always be 
a representative of the highest type of 
man in the school. In selecting Bal­
singer, the 1915 Seniors have placed

A large and enthusiastic crowd of 
Carnegie adherents turned out at Tech 
Field to see the Plaid in action against 
Waynesburg last Saturday. Although 
Waynesburg was walloped by the 
score of 55-0, the game was interesting 
from the spectators’ point of view, be­
cause it gave them the first glimpse 
at the new style of play that is being 
taught here. The play was fast and 
open, consisting mainly of open field 
play, long end runs and a forward pass 
here and there. Tech’s shift plays 
worked well and were used for long 
and consistent gains. The entire team 
showed to an advantage and presented 
the appearance of having been well 
coached. At no time was the Waynes­
burg aggregation equal to cope with 
the play presented by the Plaid eleven, 
and only once did they threaten to 
score. Standing in the shadow of 
their goal posts in the fourth quarter, 
Captain McCaughey’s men held 
Waynesburg for downs on the 1-yard 
line. Tech immediately punted out of 
danger and Waynesburg’s only chance 
to score went a-glimmering.
The backfield consisting of Kessner 
at quarter, Kreider and Balsinger ac 
halves, and Oeffinger at full, showed 
up the best. All the men ran the ball 
well and were good for long gains on 
almost every trial. Kessner and 
Kreider showed up well at end run­
ning and broken field play, while Bal­
singer and Oeffinger smashed the 
heavy Waynesburg line to smither­
eens. “Fritz” appears to be playing 
the same game this year that made 
him famous in the Haverford game. 
He runs low and hard and is a diffi­
cult man to bring down once he starts 
going. The entire backfield, while 
very light, is a good one and barring 
injuries should make it decidedly in- 
'teresting for the opposing linemen.
The line, with several new faces in 
it, worked good, and was not pushed 
to any great extent. Hellstroin at 
center, followed the ball well and 
made the play fast. Welch and Boil- 
leau at guards, and Crawford and Capt. 
McCaughey at tackles bolstered up 
the line and made large holes for the 
backs. Time and again Welch broke 
through the opposing line and took 
out the secondary defense men. The 
ends, Lauer and Mitchell, played a 
good defensive game beside being on 
the receiving end of several forward 
passes. Lauer followed the ball cau­
tiously and one of the. touchdowns 
was due entirely to his quickness in
getting down the field. Quite a few 
of the substitutes got a chance and 
made good impressions. Levy, Kel­
ly, Fletcher, Parke, McDowell, Hols- 
worth and Smith breaking into the 
game. The Waynesburg team on the 
whole was decidedly weak and played 
little real football. Lowstetter showed 
the best; he negotiated the only sub­
stantial gains made by the Tech op­
ponents. Bales punted well in prac­
tice but beside that he showed very 
little class. All the class of the 
Waynesburg bunch was gathered 
along the side lines in the form of 
“Dex” Very, Penn State’s former star 
end.
The game started with Oeffinger 
kicking off to Waynesburg on the 30- 
yard line. Sayre received the kick and 
returned to the 32-yard mark. Waynes- 
burga, was penalized for off-side play 
and Bales punted to Kessner on Tech’s 
30-yard line; he returned 10 yards be­
fore being downed. Balsinger and 
Oeffinger made 7 yards through the 
line and Kreider ran the end for 30 
yards, bringing up on Waynesburg’s 
18-yard mark. Bally and Fritz made 
it first down on two tries and then 
Oeffinger carried the ball over for the 
first touchdown of the season. Time 
required, 4 minutes. Kreider punted 
out to Hellstrom on the 17-yard line 
and Kessner kicked goal. Tech 7, 
Waynesburg 0.
Tech kicked off to Lowstetter on the 
15-yard line and after returning 10 
yards, he fumbled the ball as he was 
being tackled. Lauer picked up the 
pigskin and scampered 25 yards across 
the line for the second score. Kessner 
kicked goal. Tech 14, Waynesburg 0.
Oeffinger kicked to Bales on the 5- 
yard line and he returned 23 yards. 
Lowstetter was downed for no gain 
and Bales punted to Kessner on the 
Tech 40-yard mark; he returned 5 
yards. Kreider and Oeffinger then 
made a first down through the line. 
The next play was a neatly executed 
forward pass from Kreider to Mitchell 
and netted 25 yards, bringing the ball 
to Waynesburg’s 11-yard line. Bal­
singer, Oeffinger and Kreider made 
the remaining distance, Kreider mak­
ing the touchdow'n. Kessner missed 
goal. Tech 20, Waynesburg 0.
Waynesburg elected to kick to Tech, 
and Kessner received on the Tech 25- 
yard line. Kessner returned 43 yards 
before being downed, putting the ball

NEW PLAN TO BE ACTED ON 
THIS WEEK.
A committee composed of the 
Senior class presidents of the three 
men’s school met with Mr. Field last 
week to perfect the reorganization of 
the Student Activities Board. At the 
present time their plans have been 
completed, and are in such a shape 
that they will be presented to the 
student bodies for action at the first 
possible opportunities.
The chief objection to the present 
control of the Student Activities Fund 
is that the necessity of having two 
boards act upon applications tends to 
cause considerable delay which, while 
it is unavoidable, is nevertheless very 
undesirable in the case of activities 
needing immediate funds. It is with 
the idea of removing this objection 
that the new board is to be organ­
ized.
The Faculty committee will sever 
its connection with the Fund. Its 
only connection with the student ac­
tivities being to pass upon the eligi­
bility of the students who take part 
in the various activities. The Stud­
ent committee will be entirely abol­
ished as it now exists. In its place 
a new board will be formed. This 
board will consist of two men from 
each of the three day schools who 
will serve for two years. One man 
will be elected from the Senior 
classes of each of the night classes. 
He will serve for one year. The treas­
urer of the board will be elected from 
the Sophomore class by the board. 
It will be necessary for the men to 
compete for this position, and they 
will hold office for three years. The 
secretary of the schools will also be 
a member of the committee, and will 
have a veto power similar to that 
possessed by the Director of Ath­
letics.
The men who compose the new 
board must not be connected with 
any organization depending upon the 
Student Activities Fund in any ca­
pacity for support. This was con­
sidered desirable, as it is believed that 
the men who vote upon the granting 
of funds should in no way be con­
nected with the activities being bene­
fited by them. This was an objection 
to the old board. Likewise no man 
can be a member of the board if he 
is a varsity athlete as it is desired 
to have men elected to the board be­
cause of their interest in student ac-

A NIGHT SCHOOL EDITOR.
The announcement of The Tartan 
board competition a week ago is fol­
lowed in this issue by a special notice 
to night students. To make the Tai - 
tan truly representative of every de­
partment of the schools, it has been 
definitely decided to create the two 
new positions of Night School Edi­
tor and Assistant Night School Edi­
tor on The Tartan staff. In the past, 
news of the evening classes has been 
obtained through reporters in a 
rather unsatisfactory manner. Here­
after, if sufficient interest is shown, a 
regular space in The Tartan will be 
reserved for the accounts of Night 
School activities.
All articles for publication should 
be signed with the name and class 
of the writer and should be placed in 
The Tartan boxes in the various 
schools before 8:30 o’clock on Mon­
day mornings.
A CORRECTION.
By a lamentable mistake in last 
week’s issue of the Tartan, an incorrect 
inference was unintentionally placed 
upon the action of Dr. Esquerre in 
setting apart certain of the tables in 
the beanery for the use of the Seniors. 
Dr. Esquerre intends these tables for 
the use of the Seniors of all four 
schools. The notice as to the Plebes 
still applies in full force.
A DORMITORY.
At last we are to have a men’s 
dormitory! This information briefly 
conveyed last week is the most pleas­
ing as well as the most important 
news concerning the schools, we have 
heard since 1912, when the decision 
to grant degrees was reached. The 
one thing that has been lacking and
noticeably so, at this institution, has 
been so-called college life. In spite 
of unusual educational advantages 
this district offers, there is no over­
looking the fact that there have been 
few inducements to attract students 
to Carnegie. The average person 
does not care to, nor can he afford to 
spend the best four years of his life 
continually grinding. He must have 
some diversion, some social inter­
course with his fellow class mates.
Mr. McCullough’s remark that les­
sons may be learned on the athletic 
field that cannot be gained in the class 
room, applies equally as well to 
dormitories. With the exception of 
the few fraternity men, the majority 
of students seldom come into contact 
with one another outside of school 
hours.
Most of the large colleges and uni­
versities throughout the country are 
equipped with dormitories or their 
equivalent. In many cases, they are 
embodied in the architectural plan of 
buildings and occupy immense areas, 
as at Columbia and Pennsylvania. At 
the latter university, with which the 
writer is personally familiar, the 
dormitory life is one of the features 
of the school. Without dormitories 
college would be a drudgery, but with 
them, it becomes enjoyable. The un­
conscious influence of association 
with other young men, with men from 
other parts of the land, of other cus­
toms and habits, can only have a 
broadening effect upon development 
of an individual. This is perhaps the 
greatest benefit to be derived from 
dormitories.
The first step in their establishment 
at Carnegie must necessarily be a 
moderate one. For the present, priv­
ate residences will be made to meet 
the student demand. But we believe 
the time will shortly come when the 
schools will be forced to build dormi­
tories. Then Carnegie will have 
something to offer to students to make 
their college career pleasant and 
agreeable. Then and not until then, 
can Carnegie hope to take its place at 
the head of the technical schools of 
America.
THE TRAINING HOUSE.
The training house which has been 
established this week for the members 
of the football team is an institution 
the need of which has been long felt. 
It has been conclusively proven by 
the experience of our American col­
leges that the success or failure of 
athletic teams depends in a large meas­
ure upon the care which is taken of 
the men when off the field. In past 
years this feature of athletic training 
has been lacking, and has been be­
lieved by many to have been respon­
sible for the showing made by our 
teams. This year we will be able to 
see if these beliefs are well grounded. 
Manager Rownd is to be congratulat­
ed for bringing about this innovation, 
and should it prove to be the success 
that it is expected to be, it can be 
said that he has created an institu­
tion which should do much toward 
raising our athletic standards.
STUDENT ACTIVITIES

tivities and not because of their popu­
larity alone.
Students who for any reason are in­
terested in the board, or who desire 
any information or have suggestions 
to offer in regards to the new board 
would do well to see Secretary Field 
as he is desirous of obtaining the 
opinion of the students in regards to 
the new board, as well as receiving 
such suggestions as they can offer in 
connection with it.
THE FALL TENNIS TOURNA­
MENT.
The annual fall Tennis Tournament 
has already begun. P'orty-eight men 
are entered. This by no means shows 
the number of men playing tennis in 
the school. Practically speaking, one- 
third of those registered in the men’s 
schools play tennis, or at least play 
at it. These men should be out, for 
they never know how good they really 
are unless they come out and try.
The purpose of this tournament is 
not to pick a team. No team is ever 
picked in such a way. The playing 
is noted and those good enough for 
consideration are placed on a list of 
possible tennis squad members. We 
have a tennis team at Carnegie, and 
it is a good one. Last year we won 
five out of seven matches. We also took 
two trips. The tennis team is worth 
making. The five men who formed 
last year’s team have graduated; 
now’s your chance to show us how 
good you are.
The tournament must be played 
promptly. Best out of three sets will 
decide the winner. The bails will not 
be furnished by the tennis manager. 
For any further questions or for de­
cisions of doubtful points see Tennis 
Manager, R. S. Wilson, Senior Com’l.
CROSS-COUNTRY SQUAD 
MUST BE INCREASED.
Three Races May Be Run.
Up to the beginning of this week, 
not more than twenty-five men had 
reported for cross-country work. 
With as good, if not better facilities 
for that kind of running, than any 
other school in the country, there 
seems to be a woeful lack of support 
on the part of the students. We say 
lack of support rather than lack of 
material. In an institution number­
ing more than three thousand attend­
ants, there should be not less than one 
hundred candidates for every athletic 
activity. Track work especially 
should appeal to inexperienced men. 
Ability may be acquired by training 
and for the purpose of developing 
ability, a coach is engaged. Last year, 
Carnegie’s distance runners proved 
superior to those of any Plaid op­
ponent including Pitt and W. & J., 
with the probable exception of Penn 
State. This record can be duplicated 
if the students want it to be. It re 
mains entirely in their hands. We 
have the assurance of the coach, and 
his word is dependable, that he can 
organize a championship cross-coun-

It may be an incentive to pros­

GENEVA HERE SATURDAY.
Plaid Out For Revenge.
While the football season opened 
here last week in a most auspicious 
manner, and the team showed unex­
pected promise of developing into a 
consistent winner, yet the crucial game 
from a Carnegie standpoint will be 
played this Saturday at Tech Field 
with Geneva. Much depends on the 
outcome of this contest. Geneva beat 
us last year, 28-0, with a team that 
was in many ways not the strongest, 
but this year they have a better aggre­
gation and will no doubt be out to 
repeat t'heir performance.
To accomplish this, their chief as­
sets lie in Coach Metheney and Cap­
tain Park, two Carnegie mainstays of 
1912. Metheney was well versed in 
Tech’s plan of attack under the old 
regime, besides being a clever per­
former himself in all forms of foot­
ball tactics; so he had the qualifica­
tions of a good master and with a set 
of apt pupils, including Park, he finally 
formed a successful plan of battle 
against our cohorts as evidenced by 
last year’s score. But a different sys­
tem, a different aggregation of players, 
and a team in a different state of mind, 
will be met this year. The Western 
style has demonstrated its worth al­
ready. What person has ever heard 
of a Tech team scoring fifty-five points 
in one game? If this has ever hap­
pened before, it is beyond memory and 
time of the writer. We are hoping 
that Coach Steffens builds up a team 
to rival “Hurry-Up Yost’s old point-a- 
minute aggregation.” A good start 
has been made in this direction. Again 
this year’s team seems to have the 
fight, pepper and speed, which are the 
necessary qualifications for a winner. 
They will also be in prime shape be­
cause the training house and Steffens’ 
system of conditioning seem to be 
working wonders. Furthermore, the 
coach has placed himself high in the 
estimation of his men, and they seem 
willing to do almost anything for him. 
This attitude of the players toward 
their coach is reciprocated by the lat­
ter.
Another big factor, that should af­
fect the final result, is that the men 
will be expecting a hard game. With­
out discounting Geneva’s victory last 
year, without offering an alibi for our 
defeat, we can truthfully say that the 
men were over-confident and expected 
easy sailing. This usually proves fatal 
in all forms of athletics. But this will 
not be the case this year. We expect 
a hard game and will be prepared for 
it. It will be fight from the whistle 
and if Geneva wins (a thing which 
we hope will not happen), it will be 
because they have the better team 
and the victory will in no wise be due 
to any previous psychological effect. 
The team is determined to wipe out 
the stigma of last year’s defeat both 
for the sake of the school and for the 
sake of our former coach. This Gen­
eva victory has been a sore spot to all 
the old men on the team and it can 
only be satisfied by victory to us this 
year. We are out for bear and will 
be on the hunt for it every minute 
Saturday.
The student body should realize the 
importance of this contest. It means 
make or break ’ to us. If we beat 
Geneva this Saturday, we will have 
proved our standing for this year. The 
Waynesburg victory can then be con­
sidered as a true standard of form and 
not a flash. It means big things for 
the rest of the season. But if we 
lose, well that’s a different story. All 
the old men in school who made the 
trip last year to Beaver Falls will ap­
preciate what a victory means and 
all the new men will see the extent 
of this appreciation, if we win.
We are confident that the students 
will turn out to the man to encourage 
the boys on to another victory. They 
have a big task on hand and need 
any extra pull that can be applied. 
Last week's assemblage was a good 
one and the students should be com­
mended for their support to the team. 
I he sacrifice that the members of the 
band made was well appreciated, as 
they helped to liven up the occasion of 
such a brilliant and meteoric opening. 
Keep it up, band, your presence is 
well liked; you deserve credit. This 
Saturday's turnout should be larger 
than the one on the previous occasion 
because of the circumstances. The 
game will be worth going miles to see 
and every student and faculty member 
who has any pride in his school and 
that has any interest in athletics, 
should turn out to help the boys along. 
There will be no home game on the 
17th, so this will be the last oppor­
tunity to see the team before they 
go against their first formidable East­
ern foe, Lehigh.
THE TECH TRAINING HOUSE.
A long contemplated event is to 
take place at Tech, namely, we are 
to have a regular training house. This 
is an institution which has been under 
consideration for several years past 
but which for practical reasons had 
never been adopted.
The training house, which is located 
on Wightman street, is very handy to 
the schools and the athletic field. It 
is being rented by the schools, and 
has been furnished by them. Twenty 
men will be accommodated at the pres­
ent time. Twenty-four in all can be 
taken care of, and the full capacity 
will be attained if several of the scrubs 
show the class that they have been 
exhibiting in the past few weeks.
The men living at the house will be 
charged a price which will be only 
sufficient to cover the actual running 
expenses of the table. This is the 
same as was done last year when Man­
ager Harren instituted a training 
table.
Should the present house prove a 
success, and present no unforeseen 
difficulties, it is planned to make it a 
permanent affair. This will mean that 
the men making all the other Varsity 
teams will also have the privilege of 
living at a training house. This should 
in itself increase the efficiency of our 
athletic teams.

their trust in one who is worthy of the 
honor conferred on him.
Ziesenheim is also a student in the 
Mechanical department. He is a mem­
ber of the Zeta Lambda Epsilon Fra­
ternity, and was on the Junior Prom 
Committee last year. He is an earn­
est worker and should prove a capable 
official.
The elections for secretary and for 
treasurer were held in the usual man­
ner of oral nomination and one secret 
ballot. George R. Carroll, of Union 
City, Pa., was the victorious candidate 
for secretary, and William M. Sheldon, 
of Buffalo, N. Y., for treasurer. Car­
roll, an Electrical Engineering student, 
is a member of Beta Theta Epsilon 
Fraternity and of the Delta Skull Jun­
ior Society. He was second assistant 
football manager in his Sophomore 
year, class treasurer the first semester 
and secretary the second semester of 
his Junior year, and is a member of 
the Senior Student Welfare Commit­
tee. Carroll is a fellow that can be 
relied on to do his part in any task 
he assumes and what he lacks in size, 
he makes up in ability.
Sheldon is another embryo mechan­
ical engineer. He is a member of 
Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity, the 
Woodlawn Club, and the Delta Skull 
Junior Society. He was president of 
his Junior class during the second 
semester, was business manager of the
1914 Thistle, and secretary of the Stu­
dent Activities Committee and of the 
Mechanical Engineering Society last 
year. The class funds will be properly 
administered in Sheldon’s hands. His 
past record speaks for itself.
Before retiring from office ex-pres- 
ident Sheldon announced the appoint­
ment of the following committees:
Student Welfare Committee—L. J. 
Miller, Chairman; Balsinger, Klippel, 
Cunningham, Cameron, Carroll, Hant- 
man, Gibbs, Rauh.
Senior Coat Committee — Rauh, 
Chairman; Cameron, Carroll, Handel-

for this year were elected Tuesday, 
September 29th. The results of the 
election were as follows:

DORMITORY GIRLS GIVE 
DANCE.
Last Friday evening the girls en­
tertained most delightfully at an in­
formal dance at the dormitory on 
Morewood Avenue. The five large 
connecting rooms on the first floor 
were beautifully decorated in red and 
white, the color scheme, which was 
carried out further in the refresh­
ments.
About thirty-five couples enjoyed 
the dancing during the evening. 
Among those present were Director 
Hamerschlag, Dr. and Mrs. Esquerre, 
Miss Collingwood, Miss Lyon and Mr. 
Rush.
SHILLING JiOARD ORGANIZES.
To those who were in the school 
last year, the Shilling needs no in­
troduction. To the entering students 
we might say that the first volume ap­
peared last spring, and it is a periodi­
cal devoted to Literary, Scientific, 
Technical and Social work, and pub­
lished by the Margaret Morrison 
School, exclusively.
The Shilling is an activity which is 
under the direct supervision of the 
Department of General Studies 
though the work is done entirely by 
the students. Miss Parry, Professor 
of English, is giving assistance to the 
editors, and we are sure that the 
Shilling will soon become a prom­
inent feature in our college life.
The editorial staff which consists 
of twelve members from the Senior 
and Junior classes, is appointed by the 
department—their ability and class- 
standing being the bases upon which 
they are chosen. The appointments 
were made last week, and the posi­
tions they are to hold on the staff for 
the year, were assigned them by elec­
tion from the members of the staff. 
The result being as follows:
Editor-in-Chief, Anna M. Thomas, 
’15; Assistant Editor-in-Chief, Con­
stance C. Stout, ’16; Literary Editor, 
Dorothy Skinner, ’15; Assistant Lit­
erary Editor, Sara Wolfe, ’16; News 
Editor, Marguerite Spilman, ’15; De­
partment Editor, Ruth Welty, ’15; As­
sistant Department Editors, Ether 
King, ’15, and Blanche Booth, ’16; 
Activities Editor—Lu. M. Hartman, 
’15; Art Editor, Lorna Williams, ’15; 
Business Manager, Nelle Kern, ’15; 
Assistant Business Manager, Char­
lotte Watson, ’16.
The second volume of the Shilling 
will be ready for distribution the week 
of the Thanksgiving holidays. The 
editors have started to work in
earnest and hope to give the students 
a magazine which will please them in 
every particular.
The printing of the Shilling will be 
done by the Printing Department of 
the School of Applied Industries 
under the direction of Mr. Gage.
THISTLE REPRESENTATIVES 
ELECTED.
Miss Blanche Booth, Miss Maude 
Sanford and Miss Mary Ride were 
elected from the Junior class to serve 
on the Thistle Board for the coming 
year. All three are girls who are ac­
tively interested in the School activi­
ties, and the work of the school in 
general. We are sure they will do 
their best to represent us well on the 
Thistle.
EXPERIENCES IN THE WAR 
ZONE.
As I entered the Austalt of Dolcroze 
College on the morning of July 30th, 
small groups of students of about 
twelve different nationalities stood 
discussing the Austro-Servian war and 
wondering how classes would be ar­
ranged as we were losing some of our 
instructors.
The night before this men marched 
through the streets of Dresden sing­
ing patriotic songs—but when war 
with Russia seemed imminent a pen­
alty was pronounced against street 
confusion and all was tensely quiet.
The college was situated at Hell- 
eran four miles from Dresden and two 
from the Heller or field for military 
practice. Among my notes of August 
1st. I find that I said that war may be 
declared between Germany and Rus­
sia at any time; troops are being mobi­
lized and students are all leaving.
Every one but four Americans, a 
few English girls and a large group 
of Russians left the Pensions house 
August 2nd, as war was declared the 
night of August 1st. Away they went, 
leaving music, books and clothes. The 
people were haggard. The German 
women in tears. Hot baths were pro­
hibited on account of saving fuel. 
Clothes were not ironed for the same 
reason, and so the Russians who could 
not get home could not pay for their 
food, our supply was cut down and 
we had bread without butter and meat 
only twice a week. The police search­
ed us one morning at five o’clock and 
arrested five Russians—three men and 
two women. One poor girl shrieked 
all the way to the military prison. 
These students were released later.
I was half asleep when I was search­
ed and only remember setting up in 
bed and seeing a group of men with 
the Frau Doctor—and hearing the lat­
ter say “Sie is eine Amerikanerin”! I 
nearly sang “Oh, how glad I am!” 
That same day two Russians dressed 
as women with bombs concealed on 
their persons were caught beyond our 
village. They were treated as spies.
When England declared war, the 
English consulate in Dresden was 
stoned and it was not wise to speak 
English on the street.
My friend, Miss Howard, of Ken­
tucky went in to get her passport on 
August 3rd. She was arrested with
another American lady and an old 
Russian peddler with a pack on his 
back. With four guns on each when 
the officer said “march” they marched 
a mile to the military prison. “Merely 
a formality!” the officer told them 
when they arrived.
Luckily an American sense of hum­
or saved the day, but we were given 
police protection that afternoon as a 
result of the episode.
Many mornings I was awakened by 
the tramp of feet and looked out of 
my window to see a company of sol­
diers with a mounted officer at the 
head, marching and singing their won­
derful folk songs.
The Zeppelins flew by more often 
before the war than afterwards and 
we would all stop tennis spielen to 
watch them. They looked like huge 
steel beetles. The night I left Dres­
den for Berlin, August 20th, the wife 
of a Russian officer came to me in 
tears. “Ah Mees Stoner,” she said, 
“take my little Jeanie to America 
where she would be safe.” It was very 
pitiful for the mother was without any 
but Russian money which the war had 
made valueless.
We started for London on a Tues­
day night and reached there Saturday. 
For two nights we slept sitting up— 
sometimes in a station chair. 
Sometimes I slept at the Hague and 
the next morning went to see Mr. Car­
negie’s Peace Palace. The circum-

THE PAT I HELLENIC SOCIETY 
OF MARGARET MORRISON.
The Pau Hellenic Society of Mar­
garet Morrison was organized several 
years ago by the sororities which 
were active, at that time, in the school. 
It consists of the Psi Delto Gamma, 
Theta Sigma, Delta Delta and Alpha 
Psi Sororities.
Its object is to create a common in­
terest among the sororities, and to 
make general regulations, such as the 
pledging of Plebes. In order that ac­
quaintanceship might be fostered on 
all sides, the rushing does not begin 
until after the end of the first semes­
ter.
The members of the society consist 
of one Senior and one Junior from 
each sorority. These members act 
for their sororities in all discussions, 
elections, etc. The officers are:
President—Florence Hull, Theta 
Sigma.
Vice President—Blanche Booth,

APPLIED INDUSTRIES
I here has been some misunder­
standing regarding mail distribution 
and the present mailing facilities. In 
order to eliminate the possibility of 
letters and packages going astray 
while in the buildings it is in the form 
of a suggestion that all students have 
their mail addressed to their rooming 
houses. There will then be no room 
for doubt.
Special tables have been reserved 
in the Commons for the Faculty and 
Seniors of all schools, middle and 
lower men, watch this.
The care of the bulletin board has 
been given to Parker, Middle Ma­
chine. Let’s keep this board clean.
AQUATIC CLUB NOTES.
The reorganization of the Aquatic 
Club has met with considerable suc­
cess. This is probably due to the 
general interest taken in swimming of 
late.
At the last meeting a communication 
was received from Mr. J. Taylor, 
formerly coach at the Pittsburgh A. 
A., offering his services as a profes­
sional coach in training a swimming 
team.
This opens a new field of sport at 
Tech and we hope we can follow other 
big institutions by maintaining an 
efficient aquatic team.
The membership of the club is open 
to any student in the Institute and 
any persons interested are invited to 
attend the regular meeting, Monday, 
at Room 104, 3:30 P. M. in the In­
dustries building.
C. A. Parker, who is president of 
the club, wishes to announce that 
through the efforts of the club, he 
has secured a rate of fifteen cents per 
swim at the Oakland Natatorium upon 
presentation of a matriculation card.
At a meeting of the Soph class of 
Industries School held on Sept 26th, 
Parker was elected representative of 
the class to the board of control.
At the same meeting Liggett was 
elected class representative on the 
Tartan.
A committee of three members of 
the class was named to arrange for a 
banquet or smoker to be held in the 
near future for the Industry Sophs.
INDUSTRY PLEBES ORGANIZE.
The competition for Industries 
students for the position of assistant 
Industries-Tartan editor has begun. 
Any student is eligible. Write on 
school topics, using one side only. 
Quality counts more than quantity. 
Manuscripts should be handed the 
editor or dropped in the P division 
of the mail box.
The night registration is exceed­
ingly heavy, all departments report­
ing increases over last year. We 
would like to hear from the Night 
Tartan representative.
Herriot, ’14 Teachers, is holding 
down an excellent position as instruc­
tor in manual training in one of the 
local high schools.
Some of the Plebes would do well 
to wear their green bonnets and black 
ties before they lose part of their 
raiment. This is a Tech custom and 
a word to the wise is sufficient.
To make any doubts clear, the 
Student assembly is always open for 
suggestions. If you have any ideas 
which would improve conditions, don’t 
hesitate to get up and give them.
A number of Industries men are 
reporting regularly Sunday mornings 
at the Oakland Natatorium and en­
joying a good sport. Special rates 
for all Techites.
The first meeting of the Industry 
Plebes was held Thursday, Septem­
ber 24th.
A small but enthusiastic number 
turned out. Mr. Hartman acted as 
chairman, while the officers were be­
ing voted upon. The result of the 
election: Mitchell, president; Kerr,
vice president; McGuire, secretary 
and treasurer; Williams, Tartan 
representative.
President Mitchell then took charge 
of the meeting and the men for the 
various committees were chosen.
Club Room Committee—Patterson 
and King.
Athletic Committee—Griffith.
Student Organization—Batchelor.
Student Deportment—Koontz.
The class unanimously passed a 
resolution that fifty cents be assessed 
each Plebe as club room dues.
LECTURE ON PAPER.
A lecture on “The Anatomy of 
Paper” was given Monday evening in 
Science Hall by Mr. W. B. Wheel­
wright, the well known paper manu­
facturer of Boston. There were in 
attendance a number of the prominent 
printers of Pittsburgh, who evidenced 
a lively interest in the subject, as did 
the students of the newly organized 
Department of Printing, School of 
Applied Industries, for whose benefit 
the lecture was given.
“Fibre is the base of all papers,” 
said Mr. Wheelwright, “and in an­
cient times rags were the only known 
source. Not until the middle of the 
19th Century was wood used. About 
1850, the method of making papers by 
grinding wood was first brought into 
practical use, when news-paper was 
made from pulp. The bark is first 
removed, the logs split up and then 
ground to a pulp. Cotton rags con­
tain cellulose matter and the fibre is 
much better than that of wood, which 
contains clay. Also ground wood 
grows very brittle in the sun and in 
order to get a permanent paper the 
wood is checked with acid, in order 
to dissolve everything but the cellu­
lose matter. All the acid is washed 
out in the process of making pulp.” 
The speaker gave as reference a book 
by R. W. Sindall on “Paper Tech­
nology.”
Continuing, the speaker said, in 
part: “An important characteristic of 
the fibre is its affinity for moisture. 
Taking, for instance, blotting paper, 
we find the fibres are coarse and cut 
very short, with round open ends, 
hence the quick absorption of water. 
When wet, paper loses its strength,

the fibres becoming flaccid and of en­
larged diameter. In drying the fibre 
shortens, becomes crisp and regains 
strength.
“One of the first processes of making 
paper is the working of the fibres 
through what is called the “Beating” 
machine. The object of beating is to 
determine the length of the fibre. 
The length of beating and the nature 
of the construction of the beating 
machine, make the difference in the 
characteristics of paper. Blotting 
paper we have shown to be of short, 
coarse fibre. Wrapping paper and 
ledger paper are entirely different. It 
is a common expression of makers 
that ‘paper is made in the beating’.”
The speaker then traced the de­
velopment of the process from the old 
hand-shaking machines to the modern 
hydraulic vats, with their endless 
wire belts and great capacity.
Speaking of the matter of the 
“grain” of paper, Mr. Wheelwright 
gave some very valuable information. 
The fibres run either lengthwise of the 
sheet or across it. Owing to the ab­
sorption of moisture from the air by 
paper, the fibres become enlarged, 
thus either stretching, or widening 
the sheet, depending on the trend of 
the fibres. He demonstrated this 
with strips of paper of about 30 inches 
in length, where the increase in 
length and breadth by absorption of 
water from a sponge was easily dis­
cernible to those in the rear of the 
audience. This knowledge becomes 
highly valuable to the worker in 
what is known as the “three color 
process,” where hairbreadth register­
ing is absolutely necessary for perfect 
\york. The speaker advised the heat­
ing of the pressroom over night, or 
Saturday or Sunday, when any run of 
this nature is under way.
The speaker also dwelt on the sub­
ject of “Static electricity” in paper, 
the bane of all pressmen, especially 
on cool, dry mornings, when elec­
tricity is not conducted through the 
air, by reason of absence of moisture, 
to the earth. He cited a number of 
devices for overcoming this trouble, 
among them being the “Chapman,” 
the “Thompson,” which are electric 
devices, and also the use of a gas 
flame, over which the paper is passed 
in feeding into the press.
After the discourse was finished, an 
invitation was extended by Mr. Gage, 
head of the Department of Printing of 
the Industries School, to all present 
to adjourn to the Printing room of 
the school, where a pleasant hour was 
passed in inspection, and many pleas­
ing comments made on the excellence 
of the equipment.

all the flapdoodle to pass; precisely

WAYNESBURG
Continued from Page 1 
on the Waynesburg 32 yard line. On 
the next play the quarter ended. 
Waynesburg held and it was their ball 
on the 27 yard line. Waynesburg 
could do nothing with the Tech line 
and Bales punted to Kessner on 
Waynesburg’s 40 yard yard line. 
Waynesburg recovered a forward pass 
and after several futile attempts at the 
line, punted to Kessner on the 20-yard 
line. Kessner returned to the 42-yard 
mark, and after a series of plays, ran 
the ball for 25 yards through a broken 
field for a touchdown. Kessner kicked 
goal. Tech 27, Waynesburg 0.
Tech scored again before the first 
half was over. By steady plunging 
Tech carried the ball to Waynesburg’s 
18-yard line. A forward pass from 
Kessner to Levy brought the ball to 
the 3-yard mark and Oeffinger went 
over for a touchdown on the next 
play. “Kessy” kicked goal. Tech 34, 
Waynesburg 0. The half ended just as 
Oeffinger scored.
The second half was almost a dupli­
cation of the first, Tech scoring almost 
at will. Two touchdowns were made 
in the third quarter, one by Kessner 
and one by Oeffinger. Kessner kicked 
both goals. Tech 48, Waynesburg 0. 
The quarter ended with the ball on 
Waynesburg’s 20-yard line and in 
Tech’s possession. On several short 
plunges, Bally carried the ball over 
for the last touchdown and McDowell, 
who substituted for Kessner, kicked 
goal, bringing the total to 55 for Tech.
On the next kickoff, Waynesburg 
showed a little sign of life and by
brilliant runs by Lowstetter and Car­
roll around left end brought the ball 
to Tech’s 1-yard line. Attempt to hit 
the line failed and then Lowstetter 
tried to circle Tech’s right end, but 
Levy nailed him for a six yard loss. 
It was Tech’s ball on their own 7-yard 
line. After an exchange of punts, the 
whistle blew for the close of the game.

SCIENCE HEAR SEC’Y FIELD.
Coach Steffens Speaks 
At Mass Meeting.
Hot words from Coach Steffens and 
Secretary Field’s talk about the Em­
ployment Bureau and Student Ac­
tivities were the substance of the 
Wednesday morning Science Mass 
Meeting in Room 209, September 30, 
at 10:30.
Before the arrival of either speaker, 
Cameron and four husky Plebes 
brought the piano up to the lecture 
hall, where the Glee Club president 
led the room in the old favorites.
The talk of our head coach con­
tained some unmixed words. “The 
men out on the field are all working 
hard,” he said, “they are all bruised 
up. Now it's a question what you 
fellows are going to do. A fellow 
who don’t come out to the game Sat­
urday, unless he has a real excuse, is 
not worth while. He is a rank fail­
ure, and always will be. The men 
who wouldn’t come out when I went 
to school are teaching country school 
for about eighty dollars a month now. 
It’s real men, the leaders in Glee Club 
work, in athletics, are the ones that 
are making good.
“If the fellows get in a rut, cheer 
them out and show them that you are 
there.” The sound of the Long Car­
negie which followed the coach’s talk 
showed how the students were with 
the coach.
Following a period of songs and 
yells under the respective leadership 
of Cameron and Merril, Secretary 
Field entered. His remarks referred 
chiefly to the work of the Employ' 
ment Bureau, and they contained the 
stories of several cases, one in par­
ticular which paid about five cents an 
hour after deducting expenses. This 
position is now a very good one, 
however, on account of the good 
services rendered by our students. 
Just last week positions of blowing 
soap bubbles in East Liberty were 
filled by students. Mr. Redding of 
the Bureau is giving his entire time to 
this work now and a man is kept con­
stantly down town on the lookout for 
jobs, such is the scale of the present 
organization.
Relating to this work, the Secretary 
said: “I’ve been criticized for giving 
an impression that Tech students are 
very poor, and are depending upon 
this help given them, so that perhaps 
there is an element of charity con­
nected with it. The only thing I want 
to do is to play up the part of the 
students who need work.”
Next Mr. Field spoke about the 
Student Activities. His definition in 
regard to their purpose is: “The pur­
pose of Student Activities as I look at 
them after several years, is social 
primarily and technical secondarily.
“When the Student Activities were 
first started,” he continued, “the 
school was small and financial help 
was needed. So the students agreed 
that they woud each pay five dollars 
at the time of registration.” Tw|a 
committees, a faculty and a student, 
with representatives from each school 
were formed to consider all requests 
for help from this fund. After being
passed by the student committee the 
faculty committee could either pass 
or veto it. This year it is planned to 
abandon the faculty committee and 
have only the one student committee 
with Secretary Fields as chairman.
FIRST THISTLE BOARD 
MEETING.
Year Book Organization Started.
On October 1, at 4:30 P. M. the day 
school members of the 1915 Thistle 
Board met in Room 104 A. I. All of 
the day school members, excepting 
the art editors, who have not yet been 
chosen, were present, and the work 
of the year was started.
The election of Thomas Gleason of 
the Design 1916 class as business man­
ager was the important business of 
the meeting. Gleason is a man of 
considerable former business experi­
ence, a favorite among his classmates, 
and certainly should prove an ideal 
man for this important post.
It was decided to have the large 
board of about twenty-five meet only 
once a month, while an executive 
committee of the editor, business 
manager, assistant editor from M. M.
C. S., publicity manager, treasurer and 
possibly a few others should meet 
weekly.
Several new departures will be used 
this year. Stevenson of Science will 
hold the post of publicity manager 
and be responsible for the number of 
books sold. There is no reason why 
at least a thousand copies could not 
be sold provided there is enough pub­
licity for the students to know the 
book as they should.
The office of treasurer is also new 
this year. This position, not yet ap­
pointed, is designed to relieve the 
business manager of some of his ad­
dress duties, and also to furnish a 
check on the accounts of the book.
A committee to draw up a consti­
tution for the future guidance of 
Thistle Boards was appointed. The 
need of this has long been felt, but 
nothing has been done heretofore. 
The committee consists of P. N. Bos- 
sart, T. L. Gleason, Miss Booth, 
William Espy, and Secretary Fields.
The place of meeting for the Board 
at present will be in the joint room 
of the “Thistle,” “Tartan,” and Ad­
vertising Bureau in the A. I. building, 
but later a special room in the new 
Administration building will be given 
the Board.
Mr. Gage, head of the department 
of printing was elected a member of 
the board, and his experience and 
skill will be a valuable asset to the 
publication of this year’s annual. At 
least some of the printing work will 
be done in the new department, al­
though its capacity may not be suf­
ficient for the press work. A great 
deal of experiment can be carried on 
in the new printing shop in respect 
to the type composition of the book, 
and Mr. Gage says there is no reason 
why we shouldn’t have an annual 
unique in its mechanical excellence.
The board as far as yet elected is 
Paul N. Bossart, Sc., editor-in-chief; 
Thomas L. Gleason, D., business man' 
ager; Blanche Booth, M. M. C. S.,

MHO CLUB BUSINESS 
MEETING.
The second meeting of the Mho 
Club for this year was held in Room 
104, Machinery Hall on Monday even­
ing, September 28. Consideration of 
pins and of the possibility of uniting 
with the Mechanicals to form a joint 
club was the principal business of the 
evening. The cup offered by Pro­
fessor Wurts for the best student 
Work in discussing technical topics at 
the club meetings was explained by 
Professor Work. This cup has never 
been awarded, although it has been 
offered before.

BEANERY NOTES.
If the Beanery is to be conducted on 
as economical a plan as possible, it 
is essential that every student do his 
share to keep down the ex­
pense. In several instances this has 
not been done, the students not seem­
ing to realize that the more cheaply 
the Beanery can be operated, the 
more food they will receive for the 
same price.
One of the most important examples 
of lack of thought on the part of the 
students is in the use of the novel type 
of sugar bowl placed on the tables. 
This type was designed to do away 
with the chance of a student dipping 
his individual spoon into the bowl, un­
fortunately rather a frequent happen­
ing in the old Beanery. However, 
the new bowls are used while 
the user is thinking over difficult cal­
culus or other problems, the sugar 
being allowed to run out indefinitely. 
Enough sugar has been used up 
lately to run a large hotel. It was 
originally calculated that twelve lbs. 
a day would be a large sufficiency but 
instead the amount averages about 
twenty-six pounds and one day ran 
so high as forty-eight, the coffee cups 
coming out to the washing machine 
with a half an inch layer remaining 
on the bottom. This is pure food 
waste and it also increases the diffi­
culty of washing. Such an extra waste 
amounts to an excess in the sugar bill 
alone of $1.00 a week, which of course 
reacts against the student, for there 
is not surplus allowed to remain over 
actual running expenses.
It is to be hoped that the patrons of 
the Beanery will be more careful in 
this seemingly small, but still, when 
totalled, very large item. The thought­
ful interest of every student will be 
necessary in order to make the Bean­
ery the success that its sponsors wish 
for it.
THE SCHENLEY THEATRE.
The Schenley Theatre, that beauti­
ful new playhouse that is located in 
Forbes street, Pittsburgh, opposite the 
Hotel Schenley and within a short 
distance of the entrance to Schenley 
Park, will formally open its doors 
Monday matinee, October 12. The 
play selected for the dedication will be 
“Bella Donna”, dramatized by James 
Bernard Fagan from Robert Hichens’ 
novel of the same name. Miss Nance 
O’Neill, the well known star, who will 
be leading woman of the new com­
pany. George Alison, a well known 
actor, will be leading man. In the
company will be Alfred Hickman, 
Roxanne Lansing, Jessie Mueller and 
others.
The Box Office is now open at the 
theatre where single tickets and sea­
son reservations may be secured. The 
prices, most attractive, owing to the 
large capacity of the new theatre, will 
be 50, 35 and 25 cents for the evening 
performances and the Saturday mat­
inee. The only other matinees will be 
given Mondays and Wednesdays, 
when the price of admission to all 
parts of the house will be 25 cents. 
As the balcony and lower floor seats 
are exactly alike and that the occupant 
of each seat anywhere in the auditor­
ium has a complete and unobstructed 
view of the stage, seats in the balcony 
are sure to be popular.
EXPERIENCES IN WAR ZONE
Continued from Page 4
stances invested it with peculiar inter­
est—and we had a strong feeling of its 
futility.
Before I left Germany German doc­
tors thrust the German White Book 
into my hands and talked at a fast and 
furious rate, which spoiled my knowl­
edge of what they wanted me to know. 
The English gave me their official ex­
planation of the war in London. I 
obediently perused both documents on 
my cooped up second cabin deck from 
Liverpool to America. It is not pos­
sible for any one to state an opinion 
about how the war started and no- 
American who values our state of neu­
trality will hazard his convictions. But 
as one man on board the “Finland” 
said, “We have ’ein!” All we can say 
after seing the German wives with 
babies in their arms, tearfully waving 
goodbye to their soldiers as they 
marched, one who has seen train loads 
of prisoners, finely cheerful, and last 
the splendid English soldiers, well set 
up and sturdy, and heard of their brav­
ery in English hospitals, one’s heart 
bleeds for all of them'. It would be 
brute to say that “The Goddess of Lib­
erty looked good to me.” I was busy 
trying to get enough American money 
to tip my stewards when we passed 
her, but I did rush out and take a 
picture before the howling mob 
claimed us at the dock, and a kind 
friend helped me to disembark.
Oh, yes, I had money enough left to 
take me home but if the Tennessee 
had not brought me some gold, I, like 
other Americans who were stranded in 
London, would have had to borrow 
from our perfectly good U. S. Govern­
ment.
