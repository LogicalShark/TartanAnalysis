Carnegie Tech Kiltie Band
by Bruce Gelin
The Kiltie Symphony Band will present a concert honor­
ing Dr. Horton Guyford Stever, president of Carnegie Tech, 
at Carnegie Music Hall on Friday at 8:15 p.m.
Director Richard E, Strange and1 
Associate Director Philip B. Cate- 
linet will conduct.
All music in the concert was 
written originally for wind groups. 
Felix Mendelssohn’s “Overture 
for Band in C Major” will open 
the program. The overture was 
written in 1824, two years before 
Mendelssohn wrote the famous 
music for “A Midsummer Night’s 
Dream.”
The “Hammersmith-Prelude and 
Scherzo” was written by Gustav 
Holst in 1930 for the B. B. C. 
concert band of England. It was 
never performed by this group, 
and lay idle for 24 years until 
Robert Cantrick, former director 
of the Kiltie Band, secured it from 
the composer’s daughter and gave 
its world premier performance 
with the Kiltie Band in 1954. This 
work will be conducted by Mr. 
Catelinet.
The first half of the concert 
closes with George Frederick 
Handel’s “Music for the Royal 
Fireworks.” It was written in 1748 
to celebrate the Peace of Aix-la- 
Chapelle, and Handel recom­
mended for its performance an 
instrumentation of 40 trumpets, 
20 horns, 12 bassoons, various 
flutes and fifes, 101 brass cannon, 
and 18 pieces of small ordnance. 
The wind-brass-percussion en­
semble will perform it in the orig­
inal key, which results in ex­
tremely high and demanding 
brass parts.
The second half of the concert 
will open with Percy Gauginer’s 
“Irish Tune from County Derry” 
and “Shepherd’s Hey,” which are 
settings of British folk songs.
The finale of the concert will be 
the twenty minute “Symphony in 
B Flat for Concert Band” by Paul 
Hindemith. Composed in 1951 on 
commission by the US Army 
Band, Hindemith considered it 
one of his finest achievements, 
and often performed it on orches­
tra concerts by removing the 
strings and augmenting the winds. 
It is technically one of the most 
exacting compositions for band.
The concert will be free to all.
Congress
There will be a Student 
Congress meeting this after­
noon at 4:30 in the Wher- 
ret Room. Elections for 
chairman and vice chair­
man will be held.

Sorority queen presenta­
tions will be held Friday at

vided by the Cadillacs._____
Today, Dr. Horton Guyford Stever, president of Carnegie Tech, announced his 
acceptance of the three major women’s housing recommendations. His statement read as
?follows:
During the past year, dis­
cussions between the Division 
of Student Affairs and the 
Women’s Dormitory Council 
have resulted in a series of 
proposals to the administra­
tion concerning housing for 
women students. I have been 
much impressed by the 
thoughtful and responsible 
approach which they brought 
to the preparation of the pro­
posals.
There were three recom­
mendations:
Delta Skull, junior men’s ac­
tivities honorary, selected 18 new 
members for the 1965-66 aca­
demic year.
Those chosen include: Will An­
derson, David Altman, Pete Bair, 
Robert Blasier, Kim Cassady, 
Thomas Clements, Richard Eck- 
hardt, Robert Glaubinger, and 
Jeff Kalin.
Others selected are: Richard 
Londergan, Evan Melhado, Dan­
iel Mersel, Joseph Nirschl, Jo­
seph Orens, John Polles, Richard 
Sextro, David Simons, and Da­
vid Wise.
Carnegie And Computers
by Harry GoldenReprinted From ‘The New York Post’
Some time ago I made a speech 
at the Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology. Carnegie Tech, as the 
school is more popularly called, 
was founded by the steel tycoon 
Andrew Carnegie to train tech­
nicians for the steel industry in 
Pittsburgh. Carnegie has far out­
grown this original purpose.
Andrew Carnegie was the only 
robber-baron who practiced 
noblesse oblige. He stated publicly 
that God let him make money so 
he could benefit mankind, and 
where other robber-barons pro­
ceeded to make millionaires out of 
canny art dealers like Duveen and 
mediocre architects, Andrew Car­
negie endowed schools and li­
braries all over America.
A Scot, Carnegie eventually re­
tired to a castle in Scotland which 
he called Skibo. The auditorium 
at Carnegie Tech, in which I 
spoke, is called Skibo Auditorium, 
and in endowing it Carnegie made 
only one condition: neither pray­
ers nor preachers should ever 
desecrate its interior. Something 
to ponder.
Something elese to ponder was 
the seminar in which I participat­
ed. The seminar went by the name 
of “The Computer, Creativity and 
Modern Society.”
I have seen two of the giant 
computers industry now uses. One 
is at Eastern Airlines in Charlotte 
and this computer keeps track not 
only of how many empty seats 
there are on those flights at every 
stop; but how many seats have 
been sold at the next airport, what 
time the planes are expected to 
land and when they are expected 
to take off. It knows those facts 
at a moment’s notice.
The other computer was the 
one the Jonathan Logan Company 
employs in New York. Jonathan is 
a garment concern and the com­
puter knows to the exact yard 
how many dresses a store in Los 
Angeles will buy, how many cut­
ters are employed, how many 
dresses must be sold to pay their 
salaries — in short, everything.
Yet these computers inspire no 
widespread protest. They have 
done away with the job of the in­
ventory clerks and have, in the 
case of Jonathan Logan, even 
done away with many of the 
salesmen.
When the adding machine first 
made its appearance in industry, 
the workers protested and there 
were demonstrations and even 
some violence in the offices which 
first installed them. The textiles 
loom inspired even more violence, 
for its automated even more 
workers from their jobs.
The textiles loom inspired the 
Luddite Revolt which raged 
through England and Scotland 
from 1811 to 1816. Workmen 
smashed the machines and march­
ed against the employers and beat 
up their fellow workers who op­
erated these looms. The revolt 
took its name from Ned Ludd, 
who used to smash the stocking 
frames.
The computer has had a quiet 
introduction into industry, yet it 
dwarfs the adding machine and 
the loom when one considers its 
consequences. Why has it inspired 
no widespread labor complaint? 
The answer lies, I suspect, in our 
recent history.
There is a deeper confidence 
since Franklin D. Roosevelt. De­
spite all we hear about “federal 
control,” there is an underlying 
sense of security in the knowledge 
that the U.S. is now committed to 
the welfare of its citizens. If the 
federal government had not made 
this commitment, the computer 
would have long since inspired 
another Ned Ludd.
The computer will process sta­
tistics; it will never provide lead­
ership or produce ideas. Four 
hundred years from now, mankind 
will celebrate the 800th anniver­
sary of William Shakespeare. The 
word “computer” may not even be 
in the dictionary then. There’ll be 
something else — probably a 
toothbrush operated by atomic 
energy.
To Commuters 
Next Weekend
by Cindy Morse
Panhellenic Council will 
sponsor a women’s commuter 
dorm for Thursday, Friday, 
and Saturday of Spring Car­
nival weekend.
Accommodations for the entire 
weekend will cost $1.50. Thirty to 
sixty beds will be available in 
Morewood Garden’s recreation 
room. Those interested may sign 
up in Skibo room 103.
The food service at Morewood 
will be open for these commuters 
no minimum or maximum prices 
will be charged for commuter 
meals.
In addition to beds, linens, and 
a blanket, mirrors and hangers 
will be provided.
There will be special sign out 
sheets and commuters will be 
governed by the same rules as 
dorm residents.
A similar commuter dorm was 
set up for Fall Festival but the fee 
for the weekend was $5. The 
Spring Carnival price has been 
lowered because instead of being 
rented, beds have now been pur­
chased by the school as part of a 
long-range program.
If the commuter dorm is suc­
cessful during Spring Carnival it 
wlil be set up again during Fresh­
man Orientation Week.
Group Guidance 
Conclave Slated
by Carol S. Guber
A faculty-student conference on 
group guidance for undergraduate 
women will be held April 30 and 
May 1 at Carnegie Tech.
Members of the Senior Honors 
Program of Margaret Morrison 
College and faculty and seniors 
from leading colleges such as 
Sarah Lawrence, Jackson and 
Beaver, will meet for speeches 
and group discussions.
There will be three primary ob­
jectives of this conference: to ex­
plore through discussion the spe­
cial counseling needs of students 
as perceived by faculty, admin­
istration and seniors; to compare 
the group findings as summarized 
by discussion and group leaders; 
and to use the findings as a guide 
in developing guidance programs.
Topics to be discussed will be 
the “Special needs of Freshman, 
Sophomore, Junior, and Senior 
Women,” “Faculty/Administration 
Responsibility for Guidance Pro­
grams,” “Student Responsibility: 
Attitudes and Encouragement,” 
and “Extension of Group Guid­
ance beyond the Freshman Year; 
Pros and Cons.”
1) That A tower be made an 
“honor” tower, with minimum 
restrictions. It is expected that 
eighty spaces be assigned to 
selected seniors and juniors, 
with preference given to those 
21 years of age or older. 
Parental approval will be re­
quired;
2) students 21 years of age 
or over may live off campus if 
parental approval is granted;
3) individual suites may be 
assigned to groups of women 
that their members may more 
sharing a common interest so 
effectively develop programs 
for themselves.
Upon receipt of these rec­
ommendations I asked the 
Division of Student Affairs 
to assess their effectiveness 
on our campus in all their im­
plications. The Division of 
Student Affairs did an excel­
lent job of evaluating the in­
terests of parents and stu­
dents, the social implications 
of the proposals in our urban 
setting, and especially the 
evidences of maturity and re­
sponsibility already shown by 
students on our campus and 
other campuses.
On the recommendations of 
the Division of Student Af­
fairs and out of my own con­
fidence in the students at 
Carnegie Tech, I am very 
happy to give my approval 
to the proposals and to initiate 
the required changes in our 
housing program for women.
It is abundantly clear to me 
that the students have worked 
out these plans not so much in 
expectation of gaining a priv­
ilege but as a way of exercis­
ing the kind of responsibility 
in living of which they are ca­
pable. These are the kinds of 
programs and recommenda­
tions I have come to expect 
ever since I began to learn 
something about the students 
here at Carnegie Tech. And 
I hope that these three specfic 
propositions are just the first 
in a series of steps which we 
can work out with students 
as their growing maturity and 
sense of responsibility make 
new ways of campus organiza­
tion and living possible.
Room drawings had been post­
poned at Morewood Gardens in 
expectation of Dr. Stever’s an­
nouncement about his decision.
As stated in the Tartan of April 
13, the recommendations for wom- (continued on page 7)

Maintenance Crews
Meet The Spring
by Howard Weiss
The Carnegie Tech ground 
maintenance men have already 
begun their spring season activi­
ties and projects.
A crew of twelve full-time pro­
fessional groundmen are striving 
to maintain Carnegie Tech’s 
“park-like setting,” which gives 
a suburban - type atmosphere 
“rarely found in an urban com­
munity.”
They will continue to use such 
techniques as dormant spraying, 
spring pruning, seeding and patch­
ing of lawns, grass cutting and 
weeding to exhiece this effect.
During the spring alone the care 
and maintenance of lawns and 
shrubs account for about ten tons 
of fertilizer.
Good weather this year has per­
mitted an early start upon such 
activities as the planting of trees, 
shrubs, and plants to replace those 
which have died during the win­
ter.
A special project which will be
i continued this year is the plant­
ing of 17,000 Zoysia grass plugs 
on the intramural playing field. 
; Due to the heavy use the field un­
dergoes from the intramural and 
physical education programs, the 
1 original turf has been killed in 
many spots.
It is hoped this heavy-duty
Zoysia grass will be more suc­
cessful in resisting this constant 
heavy mechanical wear.
The maintenance department 
stated that students and faculty 
can help make their 88 acre cam­
pus more attractive this year.
The Office of Operation and 
Maintenance reports that the av­
erage daily requirement for pick­
ing up litter is approximately 
twelve man-hours. The head 
gardener stated that it would be 
a great help to the grounds-keep- 
ers and the campus if members of 
Carnegie Tech would refrain from 
littering and constant use of the 
same short cut on the lawn.
Library Adds 
5900 Volumes
by Sue Attinson
The Hunt Library has added 
more than 5900 books to its col­
lection since September.
These books include titles or­
dered by faculty members for spe­
cific courses and those requested 
by students and faculty for gen­
eral reading.
Approximately 1500 of the 
books deal with engineering and 
science, 1100 with humanities, 2200 
with social studies, and 650 with 
the arts.
Most of the books were pur­
chased with funds allotted to the 
libary by Carnegie Tech. A spe­
cial fund for the Masters pro­
grams in English and history was 
used to purchase some of the hu­
manities books.
The Hummel Gift, a sum of 
$1700 subscribed by faculty and 
friends in memory of Miss Patri­
cia Hummel, a Carnegie Tech 
alumna, was also utilized.
According to Mrs. Scarlott, of 
the library administration, “Fac­
ulty and students, as individuals 
may suggest the purchase of ti-
tles.” Request sheets are availa­
ble at the circulation desk.
The library’s technical process 
department places an average of 
150 to 200 book orders, twice 
weekly. These orders are received 
by Carnegie Tech after about five 
! weeks and catalogued and shelved 
by the 11 departmental employees 
in approximately 9 weeks.

summer employment periodically 
review listings of summer job op­
portunities on file in the bureau 
library, in suite 10, Skibo.
New listings are received and 
placed in the library on a daily
basis.
According to E. F. Ventura, 
Alumni Placement Officer and 
Summer Employment Coordina­
tor, “Unfortunately, it appears 
that many of these jobs will not 
be filled, or taken by students 
from other schools because our 
students seem not to be reviewing 
the listings.

Editorial
Obsolete Housing
“Carnegie Teeh’s residence halls are unattractive, noisy, 
and poorly ventilated. Furthermore, they do not provide for 
the differing needs of students in widely ranging curricula/'
In a recent report to President Stever, discussed in the 
last issue of the Tartan, George K. Brown, dean of student 
affairs, analyzed the Carnegie Tech housing facilities. He 
found them to be grossly inadequate in many respects. In­
deed, the inadequacy of the living accommodations provided 
bv Carnegie Tech has long been a source of discontent among 
undergraduates.
Several dormitory residents have brought to the atten­
tion of the Tartan examples of these deficiencies: Hamersch- 
lag and Scobell are intolerably noisy. Poor ventilation in Don- 
ner makes studying difficult in warmer months. The oc­
cupants of Henderson are not permitted sufficient quantities 
of electric power.
The heating systems in the older dormitories are particu­
larly primitive. There are steam radiators with uninsulated 
pipes and no thermostatic control. In all the residence halls 
there are insufficient lounge and recreational areas. In fact, 
these are often combined, as in Donner Hall. The noise from 
the recreational activities defeats any attempt to use the 
lounges for reading or studying. Finally, there are minimal 
provisions for personal privacy throughout the housing 
complex.
The existing facilities are not only uncomfortable, but 
they have been designed without regard for the differing 
needs of students whose academic orientations vary over a 
wide range. An architecture student, for example, requires 
room for drawing board and work space for building projects.
In light of these factors, and considering the recent rise 
in the dormitory rent, it is hardly surprising that upperclass 
undergraduates are moving off campus into private apart­
ments. There they experience greater freedom, have more 
comfort, and often pay lower rent per student. In fact, 
less than half (44%) the men’s dormitory residents are 
upperclassmen; the rest are freshmen, who are required to 
live in the dormitories.
But why have Carngie Tech’s housing facilities proved to 
be so unsatisfactory? Why were the newer dormitories, 
Hamerschlag and Donner, built without regard to the real 
needs of students? The answer to these questions lies in the 
school’s philosophy and its concomitant policies regarding 
living facilities.
This policy was summarized by Dean Brown in his report 
to President Stever: “Dormitories have been built at the 
lowest possible cost per student, and, in the planning stages, 
settlements have been made for inferior design and facilities 
in order to keep within established financial limits.”
Carnegie Tech has sacrificed quality to minimize costs. 
But minimizing costs does not fulfill the requirements of stu­
dents; experiences in the living environment comprise an 
integral part of the educational process.
In a recent interview with two Tartan editors,
R. D. Strathnieyer, vice-president for business affairs 
of Carnegie Tech, said, “I find our living facilities — our 
basic concept of living facilities — to be very much ob­
solete.” Mr. Strathmever went on to say, “It is necessary 
to take a serious look at the whole education-living pro­
cess; to research student needs in order to carry out that 
process.”
Evidence that such research can be fruitful exists on 
this campus today. The single graduate students in Mudge 
Graduate House have found their accommodations to be 
more than satisfactory. According to Mr. Strathmeyer, the 
students in Mudge met with the architects, designer, and 
administrators to discuss their housing needs. Furthermore, 
Dean Brown and Dr. Allen F. Strehler, faculty resident of 
Mudge, were sent to tour various educational institutions 
around the country to investigate their housing philosophies 
and policies. The ultimate result of these discussions and 
investigations was a high-quality resident hall, which caters, 
as much as possible, to the specific needs of the residents.
The Tartan, in its editorial of April 7th, called for in­
creased communication between students and administration 
to facilitate re-evalution and re-definition of educational 
philosophies. Furthermore, it requested a re-structuring of 
policies in accordance with new philosophies.
President Stever is now considering recommendations 
for both short range and long range housing improvements. 
Here is an excellent opportunity for students and administra­
tors to cooperate in creating a modern philosophy of the edu­
cation-living process.

The Forum, the newspaper 
published by GSIA for More- 
wood Gardens residents and 
members of the administra­
tion is being discontinued.
The newspaper was originally 
proposed as an experiment. The 
GSIA staff agreed to print all ar­
ticles received without editing.
It was hoped that such a com- 
^ munication might be helpful in 
diminishing alienation of students 
for the college.
The plan was approved by Dr. 
Robert J. Kibbee, assistant to the 
president fo planning, George K. 
Brown, dean of the Division of 
Student Affairs, and Virginia Mil­
ligan, Dean of Women, who felt 
that such a study might be helpful 
to the college.
The paper first came out in 
W early March. Its two issues were 
filled with criticism of Morewood 
Gardens and campus policies.
Many students felt that the sec­
ond issue had “the same type of 
criticism as the first but with 
a more caustic attitude.”
After the first issues were dis­
tributed, a group of Morewood 
residents formed a committee to 
propose to Dorm Council that 
names of the writers be made 
% known. This proposal was then 
submitted to individual floors at 
Morewood, where the residents 
were asked to sign a petition stat­
ing that the articles in “The For­
um” be signed.
Before the petition was sub- 
mited to Dorm Council Swinth de­
cided to end the project. Swinth 
did so because “The Forum” 
turned into a publication not hav­
ing “rational criticisms.”
^ He might recontinue the experi­
ment later in another form.
Many Morewood residents have 
expressed definite opinions about 
the “Forum.”
Marilyn Blitz, freshman P&D, 
feels that the paper was ideal­
istically good, but “realistically a 
failure.”
Nicki Fox, sophomore graphic 
arts, cited the poor choice of 
words in the “Forum.” She feels 
is was written on a junior high 
school level.
There are students who re­
sponded positively to the paper.
Betsy Atkins, freshman Home 
Economics, believes that the paper 
“offered a means by which people 
could express themselves without 
names.”
Various other students feel that 
the “Forum” was not given enough 
^ time to prove itself in two issues.
Speakman to Talk 
At GSIA Seminar
Dr. Frederick Speakman, mini­
ster of the Westminster Presby­
terian Church in Dayton, will be 
a guest speaker at the Alumni 
^ Conference held by the Graduate
* School of Industrial Administra­
tion at Carnegie Tech on April 30 
and May 1.
The conference will focus on 
“Innovation and the Practice of 
Management.” Dr. Speakman’s 
topic will be “Personal Ethics and 
the Planning of Change.”
Carnegie Tech’s President H. 
Guyford Stever will also speak 
during the two-day seminar.
Foreign Student Brochure
A brochure describing a new 
program to aid foreign students is 
now available in the Dean of 
Men’s office.
The brochure, published by the 
International Student Service, is 
designed to give foreign students 
an opportunity to become ac­
quainted with the United States 
by staying with families as they 
® travel.
Jean Renaud (funny you should 
mention it) Altmeyer, president 
of Scotch ’n’ Soda, is co-stage 
manager for “Whatserface.” Jean 
was also stage manager for “Viv” 
and “Miss Stars ’n’ Stripes.” She 
will graduate in psychology and 
hopes to work on the Poverty 
Program.
Larry Miller, director-choreog- 
rapher of this year’s show is a 
junior Graphic Arts Design major. 
He began his professional career 
at the tender age of eight, with a 
stirring rendition of “Life Is Just 
a Bowl of Cherries.” Due to a 
sudden decline in the popularity 
of tap dancing, Larry’s seemingly 
star-bound career took a sharp 
turn for the worse after this sin­
gular beginning. He is still trying 
to convince America that a male 
toe-tap dancer can make good.
However, to while away the 
weary hours waiting for his big 
break, he has worked as assistant 
choreographer-director at the Gey 
Gables Theatrical workshop and 
assisted in the choreography of 
several high school and communi- 
ity productions for which he also 
designed the sets and lights. Pro­
fessionally Mr. Miller has been 
scenic designer for Finnan’s Musi­
cal Comedy Theater and assistant 
designer for the inconceivably 
short-lived Yonkers Playhouse. In 
connection with Scotrh ’n’ Soda 
(and other folklore) he was a cast 
member in “Miss Stars ’n’ 
Stripes” and choreographer for 
“Evnod.” This year he is also vile 
president of the Oganization. In 
his spare moments (what?) Mr. 
Miller is ever planning his stage 
come-back in an intimate review 
version of “Golddiggers of ’33.”
Iris Ratner is a junior acting 
major in the Drama Department 
who fell in love with musical 
comedy one day and decided to 
write one. Despite the fact that 
performing is Iris’ first love (she 
played Phoebee in “As You Like 
it,” Lola in “Damn Yankees,” 
Claudine in “Can-Can,” Liesl in 
“Sound of Music,” Cairie in 
“Carousel,” Anybodys in “West 
Side Story,” Patty O’Neal in “The 
Moon Is Blue,” writing (in case 
you haven’t noticed) places a 
close second. Although “Whatser- 
face” is her first book show, Iris 
has written review material for a! 
local Pittsburgh organization dur­
ing the past several years. Scotch 
’n’ Soda then has given her the, 
opportunity to give her writing aj 
whirl, while performing in thej 
drama department at the same 
time.
Lawrence Stephens was born in 
Burma where his father served in 
the diplomatic corps. Larry, or as 
his friends call him. Lawrence, 
received his early musical experi­
ence teaching natives to sing 
Christmas carols. During the now 
historic uprising, his family mi­
grated to Peoria, Illinois, in 1955, 
and he remained there until com­
ing to Tech. In Peoria, he was a 
member of the Lincoln Players, 
for whom he wrote several re­
vues. From one of those revues, 
came the now famous folksong, 
“We Are Marching to Peoria.” 
Last summer, he worked in stock 
.playing such varied roles as Ham­
let in the play of the same name 
and the title role in “Any Wed­
nesday.” He is a freshman Dramat.
Sherman Himelblau, a fifth 
year music major, is music direc­
tor of “Whatserface.” He has been 
associated with Scotch ’n’ Soda 
since 1960 when he was band 
manager. Sherman has played 
trumpet with the Pittsburgh 
Youth Symphony and McKeesport 
Symphony, as well as in the S’n’S 
orchestras of ’61 and ’62. This is 
his second year as Musical Direc­
tor of S’n’S.
John Kavelin, set designer, is a 
senior in the drama department 
majoring in stage design. He has 
designed the past two S’n’S pro­
ductions, “Miss Stars ’n’ Stripes” 
and “Evnod.” His professional ex­
perience includes several seasons 
as assistant designer with East 
coast stock theiters. Last year he 
designed half a dozen musicals for 
the Good Olde Days Dinner The­
ater here in Pittsburgh! This year 
John designed the sets for the 
drama department’s production 
of “As You Like It.” John also 
staged the Battle of Bushy Run 
some time in his short-lived 
career.
Timothy Miller, costume de­
signer, is a junior design major in 
the drama department where he 
recently designed the costumes 
for Lorca’s “Blood Wedding.” Last 
summer Tim designed sets and 
costumes for the Theater Club in 
Washington, D. C. His other cred­
its include “Little Mary Sun­
shine,” “Annie Get Your Gun,” 
Moliere’s “The Miser,” Girau- 
doux’s “Ondine,” and countless 
I others. He has also done costume 
I designs for the Washington Ballet 
I and the D. C. Recreation Depart­
ment.
Ken Moses, a senior Dramat, is 
lighting designer for this year’s 
show. Ken has his fingers in so
many things on this compus that 
if any of them were divulged, 
well God knows what would hap­
pen, so therefore . . .
Judy Litman, Business Man­
ager, is a junior English major. 
Judy was ticket manager in 1962 
for “Miss Stars’n’ Stripes” and 
was business manager as well as ' 
a Boomer girl„(!) in “Evnod” last 
year. Outside of S ’n’ S, Judy is 
working as a research assistant on 
the Margaret Morrison study of 
Women’s Roles, and she has just 
been elected to Phi Kappa Phi na­
tional academic honorary.
Mike Hotopp, assistant design­
er, is a freshman stage design 
major in the drama department. 
Earlier this season he designed 
“All the Way Home” for the ! 
Chancery Lane Players here in1 
Pittsburgh. His previous design 
experience includes several sea­
sons of summer stock, the Show­
boat Rhododendron, various com­
munity theater and musical or­
ganizations. Specific design cred­
its include “Come Blow Your 
Horn,” “Critic’s Choice,” “The 
Taming of the Shrew,” “Girls in 
509,” “Romanoff and Juliet” and 
“Plain and Fancy.”
J. Williams, a junior Graphic 
Arts Design major, is Graphic 
consultant for this year’s poduc- 
tion. J. Williams has been with 
Scotch ’n’ Soda for thee yeas, the 
past two as a Board Member. His 
freshman year he was Dexter 
Reading in “Miss Stars ’n’ 
Stripes” and this year he is Jerry. 
Prior experience, in preparation 
for this year’s role, include travel 
in Europe, “High Button Shoes,” 
“Flossmoor Frolics,” “Carousel,” 
“Plain and Fancy,” “No Love 
Lost,” “Midnight Rock” in which 
he did his now famous song and 
tap dance to an all American 
favorite Church ditty, and Ethel 
Merman's autograph, just to name 
a few. Some of his activities on 
campus include, Sigma Nu Fra­
ternity, Swim Team, Student 
Congress, Student Union Commit­
tee, Assembly Committee, Fresh­
man Orientation Committee, 
Scimitars, Delta Skull, Omicron 
Delta Kappa, Campus Visuals and 
layout editor of the Carneçie 
Technical. Some of his work seen 
on campus are a few posters for 
Film Arts, the series of posters for 
the Assembly Committee and 
ticket announcements for main- 
stage productions by the drama 
department not to mention this 
year’s posters and programs for 
“Whatserface.” Currently J. Wil­
liams is flunking out of school
Security Office 
To Examine 
Tech Traffic
by John Leise
The Carnegie Tech Secur­
ity Office is making plans to 
j conduct a traffic survey at the 
| intersection of Forbes and 
Morewood Avenues.
Statistics will be made on both 
vehicular and pedestrian traffic,
| the directions in which the cars 
| move, and the general areas used 
for crossings.
On the basis of these statistics, 
and in view of the changes anti­
cipated from the new construction 
projects in the area, the Security 
Office will file a request in the 
Bureau of Traffic Planning for im­
proved means of traffic control at 
i the intersection.
Communications between the 
! Security Office and the Pittsburgh 
; Department of Public Safety have 
been underway for a considerable 
period of time. A request to in- 
j stall a walk-light at the intersec­
tion was made and turned down.
Chief Young, head of the 
, Security Office, hopes that the 
1 survey will result in definite mea­
sures to stop the “dangerous com­
petition betw'een motorists and 
pedestrians” whenever traffic 
along Forbes Avenue stops.
Loans Presented 
By Peace Corps
College juniors who wish to 
practice in the Peace Corps Ad­
vanced Training Program during 
the summer, may now borrow up 
to $600 to pay for their senior year 
expenses.
According to an announcement 
by Peace Corps director Sargent 
Shriver, the program will be 
financed by the United Student 
Aid Fund and the Peace Corps 
Volunteer Fund.
Trainees are chosen for the Ad­
vanced Training Program by the 
same criteria as for the Peace 
Corps. These include a question­
naire, placement test and char­
acter references.
Students are evaluated during 
the summer program and final 
selection is made after gradua­
tion.

Jim Brown, Northwestern University, '62, came 
with Western Electric because he had heard about 
the Company's concern for the continued develop­
ment of its engineers after college graduation.
Jim has his degree in industrial engineering and 
is continuing to learn and grow in professional 
stature through Western Eiectric’s Graduate Engi­
neering Training Program. The objectives and edu­
cational philosophy of this Program are in the best 
of academic traditions, designed for both experi­
enced and new engineers.
Like other Western Electric engineers, Jim 
started out in this Program with a six-week course 
to help in the transition from the classroom to 
Industry. Since then, Jim Brown has continued to 
take courses that will help him keep up with the 
newest engineering techniques in communications.
This training, together with formal college 
engineering studies, has given Jim the ability to 
develop his talents to the fullest extent. His present 
responsibilities include the solution of engineer­
ing problems in the manufacture of moly-permal- 
loy core rings, a component used to improve the 
quality of voice transmission.
If you set the highest standards for yourself, 
enjoy a challenge, and have the qualifications 
we’re looking for — we want to talk to you! Oppor­
tunities exist now for electrical, mechanical and 
Industrial engineers, and for physical science, lib­
eral arts and business majors. For more informa­
tion, get your copy of the Western Electric Career 
Opportunities booklet from your Placement Officer. 
And be sure to arrange for an interview when the 
Bell System recruiting team visits your campus.

Changes On Campus
Fraternities Adapt 
To Changing Times
by Liz Seley
The fraternities at Carnegie Tech have experienced 
many entanglements in acquiring their present residences. 
During World War II most of ?---------------------------------------------------------
the fraternities were not on cam­
pus. Fraternity members who had 
not entered the armed forces 
lived either in dormitoris or in off 
Campus housing. A few fraternity 
members lived in campus houses.
Theta Xi fraternity has occu­
pied its present residence since 
1927. Before moving into their 
house the brothers had lived in 
two other houses off campus.
In 1946 the brothers of Beta 
Sigma Rho moved into Pickering 
House. The mansion, still used by 
ythe fraternity, dates from about 
1880.
Kappa Sigma fraternity was 
housed off campus at 624 Clyde 
Street from its founding until 
1962, when it moved into its pres­
ent residence.
The Kappa Sigma house had 
been a private house which was 
bought by the university. The 
house has also been used as a 
-faculty lounge, a student union 
©and a girls’ dormitory. During 
the war, Kappa Sigma combined 
with Phi Kappa Theta.
The Sigma Nu house was taken 
over by the Carnegie Tech Chap­
ter in 1950. Prior to this date, 
the brothers lived in off campus 
residences. Between 1940 and 
1950 they had no house. The war 
years left the chapter with four 
brothers who increased the mem­
bership of the chapter by going 
out and rushing pledges from the 
remaining student body. Their 
present house was built in the 
1890’s.
Two brothers of Beta Theta Pi 
previously occupied and owned a 
house of Murdock and Whiteman 
Streets. Beta Theta Pi and Delta 
Upsilon fraternities were the first 
to occupy the duplexes construct­
ed on campus. A silver dollar was 
-flipped between the two fraterni- 
i'1ties for sides of the residence.
The Beta side of the structure 
was dedicated on October 12, 
1956. Before moving into the 
house, while the finishing touches 
were being put on, the brothers 
began to paint their own rooms. 
They were struck by union paint­
ers until an agreement was 
reached between the two parties.
Delta Upsilon fraternity has 
lived previously in three other 
^houses. Their present house is 
located on the site of the third 
house. During the war between 
eight and twelve brothers re­
mained at Tech.
The Delta Tau Delta duplex was 
completed in 1957. The two other 
houses occupied by the chapter 
were located on Morewood Place 
and the present plot respectively.
The fraternity remained open 
during World War II.
The houses occupied by Tau 
Delta Phi and Phi Kappa Theta 
fraternities were built in 1961.
Tau Delta Phi had occupied a 
house on Forbes Avenue near the
I.M. field before moving into their 
present residence.
The brothers of Phi Kappa 
Theta have lived in a total of 
four houses since their founding 
at Carnegie Tech. The first house 
was on Center Avenue, the sec­
ond was located on the land on 
which E tower of Morewood Gar­
dens now stands, the third is at 
5029 Morewood Place, and the 
duplex. During World War II 
approximately two brothers re­
mained. They lived in the Kappa 
Sigma house.
In the fall of 1957 the Alpha 
Tau Omega-Sigma Epsilon duplex 
was finished. It was the second 
duplex built on campus.
The first Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
house was near Morewood Gar­
dens E tower. The second resi­
dence was a house on Morewood 
Place.
Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity has 
had two houses on the Tech cam­
pus. The first house was purchased 
in 1937. It was the Thaw mansion 
and stood on the same plot as the 
present residence. Several art ob­
jects still remain in the possession 
of the fraternity. Among items of 
interest in the house is an Italian 
fireplace dating from the 1500’s. 
They moved into their duplex in 
1959.

3 Profs Get 
Fellowships
Three Carnegie Tech facul­
ty members were awarded 
Guggenheim fellowships for 
12 months, beginning next 
September.
They are: Dr. Simon A. Fried- 
berg, professor of physics, Dr. 
William H. Robinson, associate 
professor of metallurgical engi­
neering, and Dr. Seymour J. Man- 
delbaum, assistant professor of 
history.
Funds are granted as gifts from 
the foundation to assist in pursuit 
otf plans for self-government, 
education, and development. The 
holders are allowed research or 
creative activities.
Dr. Friedberg will study mech­
anisms by which electric current 
and heat are transported through 
certain kinds of alloys and mag­
netic crystal at low temperature.
Dr. Mandelbaum will study the 
impact of changes in communica­
tion and information systems on 
urban developments in the United 
States.
Dr. Robinson’s plans include 
studies in the field of mechanical 
properties of metal crystals.
Elimination of Pigeons
New York’s ASPCA has dis­
closed a new “humane” program 
for the elimination of pigeons — 
bird seed treated with a birth con 
trol drug.
“It would reduce flocks without 
resorting to poisoning, shooting, or 
other extreme measures,” said Col. 
Edmund M. Rowan, director of 
the humane works division of the 
ASPCA.

en’s housing were included in a 
report on housing submitted to 
President Stever by George K. 
Brown, dean of student affairs.
Other recommendations in that 
same report, which are still pend­
ing action, include the suggestions 
that “considerations be given to 
the installation of a coed dining 
system;” that a professional resi­
dent head be employed in the 
men’s dormitories to “improve 
materially the social, recreational, 
and political environments of the
men’s housing complex;” and that 
an architectural study be made 
of the hill dormitories with the 
objective of “improving the ap­
pearance and living accommoda­
tions in the complex.”

A message of importance to sophomore men
If you’ve got what it takes 
to be an Army Officen 
you may qualify for this new 
on campus training program
A new Army ROTC program starts this 
coming Summer for sophomore men who apply 
prior to May 1—only 3,000 applicants to be accepted
If you’re a sophomore now attending one of the 247 colleges and universities that 
offer Army Officer training—or you plan to transfer to one of these schools next 
Fall—you may qualify for the new two-year Army ROTC program.
This new program—designed especially for college men who have not taken 
Army ROTC during their first two years—will commence with six weeks of 
field training this coming Summer, beginning June 14. Then you'll have 
on-campus training during your junior year ... six additional weeks at camp 
during the following Summer . . . and more on-campus training during your 
senior year. Even flight training is offered at some schools.
ROTC training is really a process of learning to organize and direct others— 
to be a leader. Consider how important this ability can be to you throughout life; 
yet, to acquire it you will spend relatively little time in the ROTC classroom. 
You’ll obtain valuable junior management experience ... a fuller and richer 
campus life . . . extra spending money ($40 per month during your junior 
and senior school years, and even more during Summer training) . . . and, 
when you graduate, an Army Officer’s commission as Second Lieutenant.
Then you’ll normally spend two interesting years on active duty, often 
abroad with opportunities for travel.
Talk to the Professor of Military Science on your campus about this 
opportunity. Ask him to describe this new short program in detail.'
Or send in the coupon below for complete information. There’s no obligation 
involved, and you’ll not be subjected to any "hard sell” recruiting effort.
The kind of men the Army wants can decide for themselves if this new 
opportunity is right for them.
If you're good enough to be an Army Officer, 
don’t settle for less. Sign up now for Army ROTC.
I Send in this coupon for more information on this new two-year on-campus Army Officer training program.

Happening Staged 
By Tech Students
by Carol S. Guber
A Happening was staged at Carnegie Tech, April 11, in
the Wherrett Room, Skibo. ?---------------------------------------------------
dueers. It is agreed, though, that 
there are two kinds.
One is the spontaneous type oc­
curring, for example, when a child 
catches a ball at a ball game and 
people begin to respond by fight­
ing, throwing things, etc.
The other type occured at Ski­
bo. This was planned with a de­
finite script, but not a definite 
reaction by the participants. Those 
participating were expected to re­
act in any way to them most ap­
plicable.
According to one of the pro­
ducers of the Carnegie Tech Hap­
pening, a Happening is “an im­
provisation closely related to the 
creative arts.”
Happenings have been staged at 
universities throughout the coun­
try, at Princeton, UCLA, and 
Brandéis for example.
One staged recently at Cornell 
took place at a junk yard. Girls 
built bird nests and squatted in 
them while boys built phalluses.
The boys then rolled into the 
junk yard in an old car which 
they spread with jam.
The girls licked the jam off the 
car and destroyed the boys’ phal­
luses. The boys destroyed the 
girls’ birdnests and the happen­
ing was over.
The Carnegie Tech Happening 
occured after much forethought on 
the part of a serious group of 
students who were in search of 
variety in the creative experi­
ence.
Earlier this year several stu­
dents from the Department of 
Fine Arts went to New York in 
order to speak with avante garde 
film makers and leading creators 
of Happening.
The students who made the trip 
later propossd an arts festival, 
financially backed by Alfred Les-
The script was written by John 
Muchmore, sophomore, painting 
and design, Don Stettner, sopho­
more painting and design, and 
David Byrd, graduate painting 
and design.
Participants were given carrots 
as they entered. While confetti 
was thrown upon tfre audience 
by people on high ladders, Liz Eis, 
senior, drama, recited selections 
from the phone book.
Electronic music, composed by 
Bill Eurbin, alternated with music 
from a piano. Joe Deiinger, sopho­
more, architecture, read selections 
from Lawrence Ferlingetti’s Coney 
Island of the Mind.
The people on the ladders then 
began shooting shaving cream on 
the participants below. Shortly 
after this, a movie screen was 
lowered and a “stag” movie was 
shown.
During the film Peter Stewart, 
sophomore, drama, recited the 
“Stench” excerpt from James 
Joyce’s A Portrait of The Artist 
As A Young Man.
After approximately ten min­
utes, the movie was abruptly 
stopped and the lights went on. It 
was announced over the micro­
phone that the Happening was 
over.
At first students thought that 
this announcement was part of 
the Happening. Most of them re­
mained in the Wherrett Room. 
After approximately five minutes 
they began to realize that it was 
over and filed out slowly.
According to Lee Goldman, 
head of the Department of Paint­
ing, Sculpture and Design, the 
Happening might have stopped 
because of his comment protesting 
the second half of the Happening. 
He had said that it was “imitative 
and canned,” and a “bizarre, 
existentialist orgy.” He was not,

ted to stage its own Happening.
When asked to comment on the 
Carnegie Tech Happening, its 
producers stated, “As students we 
perhaps lack the technique which 
professional artist has in produc­
ing his work. We say that perhaps 
this very lack of technique might 
sometimes allow for just as excit­
ing a finished product. Whether or 
not this happening was “success­
ful” — it is most important to note 
that we wanted something new in 
the first place, and that there was 
a great response from those who 
attended.”
The Happening did bring a 
variety of comments from stu­
dents.
Dale Whitman, freshman, 
drama, stated that the people 
came to have something happen to 
them and not to participate.
Mary Forester, freshman En­
glish, felt that, “the Happening al­
lowed many students to express 
themselves in a different, creative 
medium.”
A negative opinion was offered 
by Frederick Kahn, sophomore, 
architect, “This vulgar, dirty, 
filthy, obscene, commie inspired 
show should be quashed in their 
conception. It’s an insult to the 
God-fearing students of our fine 
upstanding institution to have 
such blatent bad taste exhibited 
within the hallowed halls of the 
student union.”

The Carnegie Tech tennis team, 
after getting off to an excellent 
start, has run into stiff competi­
tion in its last two matches.
After beating St. Vincent, 
Waynesburg, and Washington and 
Jefferson by scores of 8-1, 6-2, 
and 5-4, the team dropped matches 
to Westminster, Bethany, and 
Grove City by the close score of
5-4, 6-3, and 5-4.
The closeness of the last three 
matches is not completely evident 
from the scores. Against West­
minster there were six three set 
matches with the victors winning 
four of them. It was very much 
the same story against Bethany 
last Thursday and Grove City on 
Saturday, as can be seen in the 
individual scores.
The next match is against St. 
Francis today in Loretto. The next 
hame match is against- Pitt on 
May 15.

IM Softball 
Action Heavy
by Chuck Beard
With a good turn-out of 24
major league teams and 10 jag 
teams, I.M. softball is well-un­
derway despite Mother Nature’s 
attempts to delay it. With about 
a third of the games played, the 
final standings are a toss-up. In 
the major league alone there are 
eleven undefeated teams.
In the Cards league the Ideals 
have slugged for two wins, a 13-3 
decision over DU and a 20-12 vic­
tory over GSIA “B”. SAE has also 
been hitting the ball and beat 
E.J.’s 9-3 and the Organization 
30-10. Also in this league, GSIA 
“B” evened up their record by 
squeaking past the Organization, 
6-5.
In the Yanks league the Grad 
Eagles have pounded out victories 
over BSR “B” 34-0 and PKT 28- 
3. SN romped to a 21-4 victory 
over the Finks but were stopped 
cold by a sub-par ATO team, 17-9.
In the Sox league BSR “A” 
rolled to easy victories over SN 
“B” 11-1 and the Chem Grads 6-1. 
On the other end of the ladder 
PKA lost two, the first to KS 10-4, 
and the second to Trips to Win 
18-13.
In the Reds league BTP was 
dumped twice, by GSIA “F” 9-6 
and by the Fink “Beauts” 10-8. 
The Fink “Beauts” picked up an­
other victory by defeating DTD 
13-7. Other action saw TDP easily 
outhitting TX for a 15-9 win.

Westminster Defeats CIT;
Tartans Sweep Tri-meet
Carnegie Tech’s hopes for an undefeated track season 
were given a rude jolt by the Westminster Titans in a pre-
Easter meet, as the Tartans went down to a 79-61 defeat. 
Tech bounced back, however, in a4- 
triangular meet involving St.
^-Vrancis and Waynesburg, chalking 
up 107 points to 45 for the Frank­
ies and 21 for Waynesburg.
Titans Dominate CIT
The Tartans were never able to 
get too close to Westminster, who 
took a quick early lead and held it 
throughout the meet. With the 
temperature in the high thirties 
and a brisk wind buffeting the 
(ffar straightaway, Tech never did 
get into full stride.
The Tartans efforts weren’t 
helped any by the performance of 
Westminster’s Gib Armstrong, 
either. Armstrong managed three 
firsts, a second, and a third, for 
19 points, just about single-hand­
edly carrying the Titans to vic­
tory.!>Chris Macosko led Tech with a 
first in the mile, a first in the two 
mile, and a second in the 880. 
Only eleven men caacked the 
scoring column for Tech, indica­
tive of the off-day had by the 
team. Gus Ralogeras turned in 
the day’s best performance, with a 
176’-5” toss in the javelin, an im­
pressive feat, considering the 
weather.
Tech Sweeps Triangular Meet
Tech had little trouble dispos­
ing of St. Francis and Waynes­
burg in last Saturday’s triangular 
meet, picking up twelve first 
places and plenty of supporting 
help. Tony Williams, with firsts 
in the pole vault, high jump, and 
i^riple jump, led the Tartans’ romp. 
Chris Macosko, paced by “rabbit” 
Paul Denberg, turned in a fine 
2:00.1 880, and also won the two- 
mile in 10:15.1.
Roger Cairns ran away from 
the field in the mile in 4:32.0. With 
a 3:18 timing at the three quarter 
mark, Cairns had an excellent 
chance to top his own school rec­
ord, but the lack of competition in 
the last lap erased this hope.
The drama department’s contri­
bution to varsity sports, Drew 
Snyder, continued to aid the Tar­
tan effort with a win in the 330 
intermediates and a third in the 
120 highs, while Bob Diskin con­
tinued undefeated in the broad 
jQump.
The schedule pits the Tartans 
against W&J, this Saturday, at 
W&J. Tech should be able to 
win hands down, with the meet 
serving as a warmup for the 
season’s highlight next Tues­
day, the triangular against 
Grove City and Allegheny. The 
Grovers will certainly be Tech’s 
(i toughest opposition this year 
and will bring a talented crew 
into town, and Allegheny is 
rugged competition in their own 
right.

Spring Carnival Is A Week Away
Honda, Raffle
The fraternities and dormitories are entering twenty 
buggies this year in the design and racing competition of the 
Sweepstakes. Each group is entering from one to two bug­
gies, none to exceed fifteen feet in length and five feet in 
width. ? '
The design judging will be held
at 7 a.m. Friday morning. There 
will be five judges, including: Dr. 
Stever, a representative of Ford 
Motor Company and one from an­
other auto industry, Mr. Ed 
Lowther, Sports Car Racing 
champion named Driver of the 
Year by the New York Times, 
and a representative from the 
school’s mechanical engineering 
department, who will evaluate the 
buggies in terms of design and 
construction.
At 10 a.m. each team will run 
a buggy with one driver and five 
“pushers” along a mile - long 
course. Each buggy will be shov­
ed by two consecutive pushers 
from the starting line at the base 
of Tech Street to the crest of the 
half-mile hill. From there the 
buggies will free-roll into the 
park. Three consecutive pushers 
will then push the buggy uphill 
three blocks on Frew Street to the 
finish line in front of GSIA.
The top six buggies in the Fri­
day races will compete on Satur 
day morning.
There are two general styles to 
the buggies, the low, streamlined 
frames with soap-box derby 
wheels, and the bicycle frame 
with large-diameter tires. A rider 
may maintain a sitting-lying posi­
tion under a bubble canopy. He 
may be in a prone position, or 
croached or laying flat on a bi­
cycle frame. One buggy requires 
its driver to ride suspended high 
above the road between four large 
bicycle wheels in a tubular V- 
shaped frame.
The designers of the buggies 
have been testing and coasting 
their partially completed and to- 
be-improved buggies for weeks 
and months, stopping traffic in the 
park and working late into the 
night.
The “pushers,” too, have been 
running and practicing.
Last year’s buggies are being 
redesigned, new ones have been 
worked on all year. Some models 
are worth as much in material 
value as $1000, plus valuable time 
and energy in engineering and de­
sign skills of individuals.
The Technical will sell a twen­
ty-four page Sweepstakes pro­
gram at and before the races. A 
full issue on the Sweepstakes will 
appear in next week’s Technical. 
A complete description of the 
various buggies will also appear, 
on the spoils page of next week’s 
Tartan.
Tickets
Tickets for the Friday night 
concert, the Saturday night dance 
and the Saturday afternoon Bo 
Diddley dance are now on sale at 
the book store, in the fraternities. 
They are also being sold by dorm 
vice-presidents.
Tickets will also be sold on the 
cut starting next Monday, and 
some will be available at the 
events.
The tickets for the three events 
include the Honda door prize stub 
and are $10 per couple.
The Spring Carnival Commit­
tee is encouraging the purchase of 
the $10 per couple ticket to help 
make this a truly successful all­
school weekend. Single tickets, 
however, can be purchased for the 
separate events.
The Mitchell Concert ticket is 
being sold at $3.75 per person, 
dance tickets at $2 per person, and 
Bo Didley tickets at $2 per person.
No one will be admitted to any 
of the three events—including the 
trophy presentations — without a 
ticket.
A Honda 50 will be given away 
as a door-prize at the dance Sat­
urday night.
The Mitchell Trio will draw ten 
ticket stubs, each of which will be 
placed in an envelope to be held 
by Security until the following 
evening.
At this time, between 10 p.m. 
and 11 p.m. Saturday night, the 
first envelope and the stub num­
ber announced.
If the holder of the matching 
number does not appear within 
five minutes after the announce­
ment, he will forfeit the prize, 
and the next envelope will be 
opened.
This procedure will be followed 
until a winner can claim it.
Plank Joust
Groups entering the plank 
jousting event must contact 
George Mink at 621-2689.
Competitors in the faculty egg 
toss are to contact Paul Magnu- 
son at 683-1379.
Midway Booths And Rides
Descriptions of the themes of 
fraternity and dorm booths will 
appear next week in the Tartan. 
At that time the entertainment 
and bands for the Midway with a 
description of the three carnival 
rides, will be announced.
The Tartan extends its 
special thanks to Elissa Park­
er for providing the informa­
tion and photos on this page.
The Mitchell Trio will spark 
the Friday evesing of Spring Car­
nival Weekend with their highly- 
praised ‘and much-banned topi­
cal folk-style satires.
They will entertain in the 
gymnasium from 9 p.m. to 11 
p.m. The gymnasium door will 
open at 8:30 p.m. and the win­
ners of the Talent Jamboree will 
entertain while the audience is 
being seated.
The controversial songs of the 
Mitchell Trio range from “The 
Twelve Day of Christmas,” using 
an increasingly militant chant of 
the carol as music for a satire 
on Neo-Nazism, through “The 
Ideas of Texas,” extolling the 
virtues of its most recent hero, 
Billie Sol Estes, and “Alma 
Mater,” a salute to the nostalgic 
college days of Ole Miss.
The trio is probably most iden­
tified with their recording of 
“The John Birch Society.”
The Mitchell Trio has appeared 
as a headlining group in T.V. 
shows, night clubs, and colleges 
across the country, and have re­
cently participated in a fifteen- 
week tour of America under the 
auspices of the United States 
State Department.
During intermission the Mitch­
ell Trio will draw ten stubs for 
the Saturday night Honda pres­
entation.
Refreshments will be 
the Black Cat Lounge.
