Aharoni speaks on branding
by Mariluz Orbay
Junior Staffwriter
Ido Aharoni is a salesman. But 
instead of selling a product, he’s 
trying to sell a country.
On Thursday, the Israeli as­
sistant foreign minister and 
brand team manager spoke to a 
crowd of students in Porter Hall
100 about how a nation’s brand 
identity affects its image and, 
consequently, its relations both 
internally and globally.
“Branding a nation is a new 
emerging process meant to even­
tually bring an improved image,” 
he said. “And Israel’s brand im­
age does not serve its interests 
right now; I believe we can do 
much better.”
The lecture was brought to Car­
negie Mellon by Caravan for De­
mocracy, an outside organization 
affiliated with the Hillel Jewish 
University Center of Pittsburgh, 
which is dedicated to bringing 
different speakers from Israel to
discuss the challenges the coun­
try faces as the only democracy 
in the Middle East.
“It is time for the Arab world 
to look in the mirror,” Aharoni 
said in an interview with The 
Tartan. “What is the future of a 
society that nurtures the culture 
of death?”
Only the citizens of the Arab 
world can initiate the effort to 
modify the region’s brand image, 
Aharoni said.
The Foreign Ministry has been 
pushing a re-branding effort for. 
Israel over the past several years. 
Its goal is to shift the widely- 
held perception that Israel is 
defined solely in terms of war 
and religion, and ensure that the 
country’s positive qualities are 
defined by Israel itself instead of* 
by its critics and enemies.
Aharoni referred to the pop­
ular movie Borat, a comedy 
featuring a character who goes 
around interviewing different 
sources in the U.S., which has 
falsely branded Kazakhstan as
a racist country. The greatest 
danger a country faces when 
it doesn’t define its own brand 
identity, Aharoni said, is that it 
allows others to do it, and as a 
result becomes “Boratized.”
There are many ways for a 
country to build a solid brand 
image, Aharoni said, including 
revising its policies, initiating 
greater tourism efforts to give 
visitors first-hand experience of 
the country’s true essence, and 
increasing exports and foreign 
investment. .These aspects, he 
said, show the world the identity 
of a country.
Aharoni explained the psycho­
logical antecedents of branding, 
which includes 20th-century 
psychologist Erving Goffman’s 
theory that it is a basic rule of hu­
man interaction that people will 
always try to seek control over the 
way others perceive them. People 
send messages and build expec­
tations to build their individual 
public personae, Aharoni said,

Protected sex might soon get a lot cheaper 
|at universities nationwide. A bill proposed 
to the House of Representatives last Thurs­
day would dramatically reduce birth control 
f prices on college campuses.
The Prevention Through Affordable Ac- 
¡ cess Act was proposed to the House by Rep. 
Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) in an effort to ad­
dress the increase in the price of birth control 
¡that began in January 2007
The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA), signed 
¡into law by President Bush in 2005, caused 
¡the price hikes and set them up to take place 
/o years later.
The DRA prevented the Centers for Medi- 
|eare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from 
allowing university health services and safety 
let providers to buy birth control in bulk at 
r discounted prices as they had done before.
“Students that are on the Carnegie Mellon 
University health insurance plan continue 
po receive a generous discount for oral con- 
raception at student Health Services,” said 
t Paula Martin, registered dietitian at Health 
Services and president of the Women’s 
bsociation, an organization of women 
faculty and staff members dedicated to the 
|well-being of female students.
After the DRA went into effect, students 
lid between $5 and $20 for generic and 
¡name-brand contraceptives included in the 
^university health plan.
However, as the university no longer re­
ceives discounted rates from CMS, it has 
id to raise costs for uninsured students to 
compensate.
Therefore, students without knowledge of 
ieir parents’ insurance carriers, or who are 
liding oral contraceptives from their par­
ents, have been required to pay about $40 
lore per month.
“The university has an obligation to pro­
vide birth control at a low price to students 
/ho must, for some reason, depend on their 
: Own limited budgets,” said Janine Dutcher, 
jphomore psychology major and peer 
lealth advisor.
A similar situation has occurred with safety 
let providers, organizations that deliver a 
significant level of health care to patients 
¿ho are uninsured, on Medicaid, or other- 
ise financially vulnerable. These providers 
lclude public school-based clinics, commu- 
lity health clinics, and public hospitals.
Safety-net providers have been especially 
¡ffected, since the majority of the women 
ley treat are hiding oral contraceptives 
rom their parents, or lack sufficient insur- 
ice to cover them.
“CMU is probably not nearly as affected by 
is [as safety-net providers] because every- 
|One is required to have insurance here, and 
lost insurances cover birth control,” said 
Dutcher.
Echoing Dutcher’s sentiment, Martin re­
ported minimal change in the number o| 
students receiving birth control from Health; 
Services before and after the DRA, despiteJ 
the price hike.
However, it is estimated that the DRA 
has affected an estimated three millior 
college-aged women nationwide with 
disproportionate impact on low-income 
students.
“I can’t believe that there’s such a disparit 
between the different economic groups anc 
that can just be okay,” said Gabby Moskow- 
itz, sophomore computer science major anc 
executive board member of the CMU College 
Democrats.
Crowley’s bill, which he deemed the “com| 
mon sense” initiative, proposes a reversal of 
the pricing provision of the DRA and a re 
turn of the discounts as given before Januai 
2007.
Crowley said the DRA provision was a “bdj 
reaucratic mistake” to begin with, according 
to a Nov. 1 article in The Chronicle of Higher 
Education.
“This isn’t just a democratic initiative,’ 
said Moskowitz. “It spans all parties anc 
with absolutely no cost to taxpayers, the bil 
seems more than favorable.”
The bill appears to have bi-parti­
san support, and is co-authored by twc 
Republicans and two Democrats, as well
101 co-sponsors of both parties in the House 
of Representatives.
Planned Parenthood is also a stror 
advocate of the bill, issuing a press release 
immediately after its proposal which state« 
that the organization supported Crowley’fj 
initiative.
“The American College Health Associf 
tion, of which we are a member school, 
providing advocacy on this issue and is keep-; 
ing members informed of the Capitol Hil 
response,” said Anita Barkin, director oi 
Health Services.
However, Health Services insists that ore 
contraceptives are not the only option.
“Condom use is still the easiest anc 
cheapest prevention method,” Martin saic 
“Condoms are recommended even if 
woman is on oral contraception for protec 
tion from sexually transmitted infections as 
well as pregnancy.”
The U. S. Department of Health and Hume 
Services has started the Healthy People 201C 
campaign, a comprehensive set of disease 
prevention and health promotion objectives 
for Americans.
One of the campaign’s focus areas is to in­
crease the percentages of college-aged an? 
young adults using both condoms and oral 
contraceptives.
“Accessibility of oral contraceptives to 
women could prove to be key to this initia 
tive and so much more,” Moskowitz said.
The Prevention Through Affordable Ac 
tion Act is expected to come to a vote in the: 
coming weeks.

Whether Carnegie Mellon 
students find themselves buying 
cage-free eggs from Entropy-1-, 
throwing their glass bottles into 
the recycling bin in the Univer­
sity Center’s Green Room, or 
falling asleep every night under 
the roof of New House, the first 
green dormitory in the country, 
it’s clear that Carnegie Mellon’s 
green practices are deeply inte­
grated into campus life.
“It’s collaboration between 
faculty, .staff, and students. 
We’re doing a lot of good stuff 
and, as a whole, it’s a big ini­
tiative,” said Barbara Kviz, 
environmental coordinator of 
Facilities Management Services 
and co-chair of the Green Prac­
tices Committee.
This “good stuff” is drawing, 
attention from many nationally 
recognized organizations. Carn­
egie Mellon was recently ranked 
the 10th “coolest” school by Si­
erra magazine in its November/ 
December cover story for its ef­
forts to thwart global warming 
and create a greener campus. In 
addition, the university received
$22 million from the Heinz 
Endowments, $8.5 million of 
which will be earmarked for 
the university’s work in green 
chemistry, according to an Oct. 
26 press release.
The Sierra Club, the largest 
grassroots environmental or­
ganization in the United States, 
commended Carnegie Mellon 
for its green roofs on the Posner 
Center and Hamerschlag Hall, 
as well as the modular-raised 
floor system in the Collaborative 
Innovation Center, which al­
lows double the normal amount 
of fresh air to circulate through 
the building.
The magazine also recognized 
Carnegie Mellon for its commit­
ment to pursuing Leadership in 
Energy and Environmental De­
sign (LEED) silver certification 
for all buildings constructed af­
ter 2001. Certification measures 
water efficiency, sustainable 
sites, energy and atmosphere, 
materials and resources, and 
indoor environmental quality. 
Currently, Carnegie Mellon re­
quires a minimum level of silver 
for all its buildings. In 2003, 
New House was the first build­
ing on campus to receive the 
LEED silver certification.

The Cut was lined with cans on Wednesday as student organizations competed in the annual 
“Cans across the Cut” food drive competition. The foods include everything from spaghetti 
sauce to fruits and vegetables, all given to the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. The 
goal of each organization is to make a line across the Cut with their donated cans over a period 
of eight hours. The winner receives a trophy and their team photo is displayed in the University 
Center.
“We were the first house to 
have recycling bins in every 
room,” said M. Shernell Smith, 
coordinator of Student Develop­
ment and director of New House 
environmental programming. 
“It. worked because we didn’t 
have a seminar on recycling, 
you’d just come home and it was 
in your face. It began a trend on 
campus, and now every dorm on 
campus has — or should have — 
a recycling bin.”
The university’s efforts have 
rubbed off on students.
“Being in New House and on 
this campus has made me think 
about things I never really took 
the time to think about before,” 
said Kaeo Helder, a first-year 
architecture student and New 
House resident.
But students should also look 
for ways to further improve en­
vironmental efforts on campus, 
Kviz said.
She encourages students to 
come to her if they see opportu­
nities to save energy.
“If you see something that 
isn't right, contact me, let me 
know,” she said. “We’ll make the 
improvements. We can always

Relay race, policy debate connect students to local issues
Students discuss local governmentAPhiO to hold wheelchair race
In honor of community service fra­
ternity Alpha Phi Omega’s National 
Service Week (Nov. 4 to 10), Carnegie 
Mellon’s chapter of APhiO will host 
“Wheels of Glory,” a manual wheelchair 
relay race, on Saturday. The theme of 
this year’s week is “helping children 
with disabilities,” and the money raised 
from the event will go to Families of 
Spinal Muscular Atrophy, the largest 
non-profit organization supporting 
those with spinal muscular atrophy 
(SMA), a genetic neuromuscular dis­
ease that affects the nerves controlling 
voluntary muscle movement.
In teams of four, participants will 
compete in a relay race using manual 
wheelchairs (wheelchairs will be pro­
vided). Those who wish to play or watch 
should meet in the Morewood parking 
lot Saturday at 3 p.m. Registration is 
$10 per team. Teams can register at the
tables outside Doherty Hall.
The event was organized by sopho­
more mechanical engineering major 
Heather Tomko, who has SMA.
“I wanted to do a fundraiser that 
would serve children with disabilities, 
but also one that would be fun and 
would get as many people as possible 
involved, since the cause is one that 
is so important to me,” Tomko said. 
“And since people have been asking me 
if they could drive my wheelchair for 
as long as I can remember, I thought 
that people would have a blast with a 
wheelchair race of their own.”
Those who cannot attend Wheels 
of Glory but would like to support the 
cause can make a donation to Families 
of Spinal Muscular Atrophy through 
APhiO or directly through the organi­
zation’s website, www.fsma.org.
Last week, more than 50 students 
from the Heinz School of Public Policy 
and Management and the University 
of Pittsburgh’s School of Social Work 
and Graduate School of Public and 
International Affairs competed in 
the 2007 Local Government Case 
Competition sponsored by the Allegheny 
County Department of Human Services 
to debate the best way for human ser­
vices to be administered in the future. 
The students worked together in 13 
teams to develop a set of solutions and 
presented their ideas to the judges, local 
government, foundation, and business 
leaders.
Case Competition administrators 
determined the makeup of each team 
in order to ensure that they were in­
terdisciplinary and included students 
from various backgrounds. Participants 
debated a local government issue and
were advised to confront the problem as 
government or business leaders would. 
Each team devised and presented an 
appropriate solution based on the given 
information. The first-place team re­
ceived $3000; the second-place team 
received $1500.
According to the Department of 
Human Services, the goals of the compe­
tition were to enable students to use their 
creativity and knowledge to confront 
and solve issues in the public sector, and 
increase students’ awareness of opportu­
nities in the local government.
The competition was co-funded by the 
Human Services Integration Fund.

Unclouding the human brain
Researchers develop microcapsules to 
instruct neural stem cells
by Hanadie Yousef
Staffwrite
Biomedical engineering pro­
fessor Stefan Zappe and his 
research team are developing a 
neural stem cell therapy to treat a 
variety of genetic disorders of the 
central nervous system, includ­
ing Hunter syndrome.
Stem cells are primal cells that 
retain the ability to renew them­
selves and multiply through cell 
division. These cells can also dif­
ferentiate into a diverse range of 
cell types.
Zappe said, “It’s like a wild 
card,” speaking of neural stem 
cells.
Adult stem cells are found in 
adult tissue and act as a bodily re­
pair mechanism because they can 
be matured into specialized cells 
when these cells become injured.
According to a Carnegie Mel­
lon press release, Zappe and his 
collaborator Raymond Sekula, a 
neurosurgeon at Allegheny Gen­
eral Hospital, are working with 
adult neural stem cells because 
they can be harvested from a pa­
tient’s brain.
Neural stem cells can then be 
manipulated to multiply and dif­
ferentiate into any cell type of the 
brain.
Hunter syndrome is a disease 
in which patients lack the enzyme 
iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS), an 
essential protein needed to help 
cells break down toxic waste. 
According to a Carnegie Mellon 
press release, one in 130,000 boys 
are born with Hunter syndrome.
Sasha Bakhru, a graduate stu­
dent in Zappe’s lab, stated in an 
e-mail, “The present therapy for 
Hunter syndrome involves de­
livery of an active, recombinant 
version of the lacking enzyme, 
IDS, through the blood. This 
works to relieve the problem in 
almost all tissues of the body, but 
not the brain.”
In the past, a major barrier to 
treating brain disorders result­
ing from lack of expression of 
a particular protein has been 
the blood-brain barrier. The 
blood-brain barrier is the divi­
sion between brain tissue and 
blood vessels that regulates the 
pathway of drugs in the brain.
To overcome this barrier, Zappe 
and Bakhru have developed cell- 
instructive microcapsules that 
contain genetically modified 
neural stem cells. These micro­
capsules control proliferation 
and differentiation of neural 
stem cells.
“Our microcapsules contain­
ing stem cells are implanted on 
the other side of the blood-brain 
barrier, providing the cell^access 
to the affected tissue of the brain, 
into which they may migrate and 
integrate,” Bakhru stated.
Zappe said that neural stem 
cells tend not to attach to 3-D 
surfaces, but instead, they “float 
around” as “neurospheres” (clus­
ters of neural cells). Cells at the 
center of these clusters do not 
receive nutrients, and they die or 
spontaneously differentiate.
“The idea would be to adapt 
the microcapsule culture to hu­
man neural stem cells,” he said.
The microcapsules are made 
out of modified collagen held 
together by positively charged 
collagen and a negatively charged 
polysaccharide, alginate.
The neural stem cells are 
suspended in microdroplets 
of modified collagen solution, 
which make up the inside of each 
microcapsule.
In addition, the microcap­
sules contain growth factors 
and other proteins, all of which 
are located within the collagen 
matrix. Growth factors prevent 
differentiation of the stem cells 
into other cell types.
Zappe said, “Our idea is to 
create new stem cells that are 
implanted into the brain. They
are engineered so that they can 
produce the missing enzyme [in 
Hunter syndrome patients].”
The neural stem cell therapy 
begins by harvesting a small 
number of stem cells from a 
brain tissue sample.
Zappe said, “You start with a 
single stem cell...and you cre­
ate many many stem cells.”
The adult neural stem 
cells are then microencapsu­
lated for expansion in the cell 
culture.
Bakhru stated, “These cells 
are then harvested from 
microcapsules and geneti­
cally modified to produce 
[the enzyme] alginase (for 
delivery) and IDS (to treat 
the underlying problem) 
on demand, in response to 
administration of two chemical 
inducers.”
“The genetically engineered 
cells are then re-encapsulated 
for expansion and implantation 
into the brain,” Bakhru stated.
The microcapsules are then 
implanted into the brain.
Within the brain, the micro­
capsules protect the stem cells 
from exposure to inflamed tis­
sue after surgery, which would 
otherwise cause many of the im­
planted stem cells to differentiate 
into scar tissue, or die.
After inflammation has passed, 
patients will be given a chemical 
inducer in pill form. This chemi­
cal will stimulate the stem cells 
and cause them to produce and 
secrete an enzyme called algi­
nase.
The alginase selectively breaks 
down the alginate in the micro- 
capsule wall, thereby freeing the 
cells. The cells may then migrate 
into the surrounding tissue.
Upon administration of a sec­
ond inducer, the cells secrete the 
needed enzyme IDS to be used by 
neighboring neural cells.
So far, researchers have shown 
that this drug therapy system is

How Things Work: Aircraft carriers
Michael M. Whiston
Taking off from an aircraft 
carrier requires more than just 
radio communication between 
a pilot and ground crewmen — 
it takes the mechanical power 
of massive catapults and fast- 
acting braking systems.
Aircraft carriers have enough 
engine power to launch one air­
plane every 25 seconds.
The most important com­
ponent of an aircraft carrier is 
the flight deck, or the landing 
and launching strip. Because 
the flight deck is so short, pilots 
and ground officials must keep 
close watch over all aircraft 
that are located on the carrier 
and flying around the ship.
U.S. aircraft carri­
ers belonging to the Nimitz 
class of carriers have a runway 
that is just over 300 meters 
long; for comparison, the run­
way at John F. Kennedy Inter­
national Airport in New York is 
about 4400 meters long. In ad­
dition, Nimitz aircraft carriers 
have a flight deck that is about 
250 feet wide, and they are ca­
pable of traveling at 34 miles 
per hour.
Nimitz aircraft carriers also 
consist of a hangar deck, island, 
and power plant. The hangar 
deck is the area of the ship 
where stationary planes are 
kept. Planes are also repaired in 
the hangar deck, and they are 
transported to the flight deck 
by giant elevators.
The island, the building 
where officials regulate the 
movement of aircraft on and 
around the ship, is located on 
top of the hangar deck. Crew 
members in the island also steer 
the carrier.
The lower decks, on the other 
hand, contain machinery that 
powers the carrier. The engine 
pushes the ship forward with 
propellers.

Aircraft carriers use catapults to help airplanes accelerate from zero to 150 miles per hour in three seconds.
The hull — or main body—of 
a Nimitz aircraft carrier is made 
of steel that is thick enough to 
protect the carrier against fire 
damage. The bottom of the ves­
sel consists of two layers of steel 
to protect the ship against tor­
pedo attacks.
For a plane to take off from an 
aircraft carrier, it must acquire 
enough lift force to take off 
from the short flight deck. Some 
of this lift force is produced by 
the wind, but most comes from 
on-board machinery. To gen­
erate lift, planes are launched 
by four catapults on the ship’s 
flight deck. The catapults are 
powered by pistons that are 
housed inside cylinders.
Prior to takeoff, the plane’s
front wheels are attached to the 
catapult’s shuttle, or the part 
of the catapult that sits on the 
flight deck’s surface. Once the 
plane is prepared for takeoff, 
the catapult’s cylinders fill with 
steam. The steam creates a re­
gion of high pressure inside the 
cylinders. Eventually, the pis­
tons unlock, and the catapults 
launch the plane forward.
Under the force of these cata­
pults, it takes three seconds for 
planes to accelerate from zero 
to 150 miles per hour.
Similar to takeoff, landing 
an aircraft involves the work 
of several machines aboard the 
ship, in addition to monitoring 
by ground crewmen.
To land a plane, the pilot 
_______&________________:__________
flies over the flight deck and at­
taches a hook on the plane to a 
steel wire on the ship, called the 
arresting wire. The arresting 
wire is attached to a hydrau­
lic system that slows the plane 
down. It can stop the plane in a 
distance of 300 feet. There are 
four such wires on the ship, but 
pilots always try to catch the 
third wire because it’s safest.
Furthermore, because the 
landing strip is so short, land­
ing a plane requires close 
communication between the 
pilot and ship crew.
When multiple planes await 
landing, they fly in an oval for­
mation. One by one, air traffic 
control gives the planes clear­
ance to land. 
---------------------------------j--------------------
If a plane is not on target for 
landing, the landing signal offi­
cer (LSO) can use radio or light 
signals to redirect the plane. 
The LSO can request that the 
plane abort a landing attempt.
Pilots are also directed to 
the flight deck by the Fresnel 
Lens Optical Landing System 
(FLOLS). FLOLS is a collection 
of lenses that produces light 
beams at different angles. The 
different lights beams inform 
the pilot about his or her posi­
tion relative to the aircraft.
In particular, if the pilot sees 
an amber light in line with a 
series of green lights, then the 
plane is correctly aligned with 
the runway.
However, if the amber light 
appears to be out of line with 
the other lights, then the plane 
is misaligned with the runway.
If the plane doesn’t catch 
one of the arresting wires upon 
landing, then the plane takes 
off again from the ship. As a 
safeguard, when the plane 
lands, it immediately turns its 
engines to full power.
If the plane successfully 
catches the arresting wire and 
comes to a stop, it is moved to 
the side of the landing strip.
While accidents involving 
aircraft carriers are rare, crew 
members can be thrown over­
board by a jet engine or be 
injured by onboard mechanical 
failures.
In 1995, a sailor was killed 
on a U.S. aircraft carrier during 
a maintenance procedure. The 
crew member was maintaining 
the hydraulic system for one of 
the arresting wires when one of 
the piston caps flew out at him.
To help prevent injury dur­
ing landing, aircraft carriers 
are equipped with fire trucks 
and tanks of water. Crew mem­
bers also wear inflatable coats 
in case they are thrown over­
board. The jackets have lights 
on them for search and rescue.

Violence goes on 
YouTube
YouTube has been grappling 
with issues of free speech and 
censorship following a deadly 
school shooting in Finland 
that left nine people dead on 
Wednesday.
Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the al­
leged shooter, had posted a 
video showing a photo of Jokela 
High School that transitioned 
to a man pointing a gun at the 
camera.
YouTube responded quickly 
to this by removing the video­
sand profile page of Auvinen’s 
username “Sturmgeist89.”
YouTube’s term of use agree­
ment bans “pornography, ob­
scene, or defamatory material” 
but the site still contains ma­

Planet discovered 
in constellation
Astronomers have found 
another planet that orbits the 
star called 55 Cancri, making
5 planets total. This system of 
planets looks similar to our so­
lar system — it has four smaller 
planets orbiting close to the star 
and a larger planet orbiting far­
ther away.
The planet circles 55 Cancri 
from around 70 million miles 
away, which is approximately 
the distance of Venus from the 
Sun. The planet takes 260 days 
to orbit the star.
Researchers suspect that the 
planet is similar to Neptune or 
Saturn. Thus, it would not be 
able to support any kind of life.
On the other hand, the planet 
could have rocky moons that 
would have the same tempera­
tures as Earth. However, these 
moons would need to be as 
large as Mars to maintain the 
presence of water.

Intellectual laziness leads to misinterpretation
illegal immigrants is not only to add a 
non-existent context to the message but 
to reverse its entire meaning.
This offended party’s disgust is trans­
mitted, and nobody bothers to reread 
the work with an eye toward judging 
context, if they bother to read it at all. 
Higher and higher offices are petitioned, 
and soon action is taken to destroy the 
offensive but benign speech, rather than 
to engage in the positive discussion 
which is the valid answer to speech one 
finds objectionable.
Certainly this pattern and this prob­
lem are not limited to the Carnegie 
Mellon campus. Individually, it is under­
standable and excusable, but when 
larger numbers of people are involved, 
there’s no reason why this should occur 
at Carnegie Mellon at all. We’re smarter 
than that.
The article “Administration white­
washes ‘threat’” in last week’s issue of 
The Tartan shows an example of a threat 
to free speech which is both subtle and, 
unfortunately, common on the Carnegie 
Mellon campus. That threat is intellec­
tual laziness.
Perhaps intellectual laziness is the last 
thing most would expect of the Carnegie 
Mellon community, given our academic 
reputation, but it exists nonetheless. The 
mechanism is simple: One person reads 
something with half an eye, and incor­
rectly gleans from that work a message 
which he or she finds abominable above 
and beyond any legitimate tastelessness 
in the message itself.
“MEXICO. No illegals, no burritos; 
you better think twice, America.” The 
message is not obvious, but neither is it 
dense. It’s not exactly high satire. Is it 
offensive? Probably. Is it profane? Yes. 
Is it stupid? My sources say “yes.” But to 
read into that message a threat against

Rent-A-Dog raises spirits,
How much is that doggie in the win­
dow really? According to reports, a dog 
will run you somewhere from $500 to 
3000 for the first year, and about half of 
that for every other year. I don’t know 
about other college students but that is 
not an expense I can afford while paying 
about $50,000 a year for an education. 
I can, however, afford $5 to dedicate 
a half hour of my time to a homeless 
animal that I think needs a little more 
affection than traditionally given.
Last week’s article “Rent-A-Dog 
offends” didn’t cover the whole story. 
Granted, the execution of the event 
wasn’t without error and I believe the 
campus community can agree that no 
event performed at Carnegie Mellon is 
ever flawless, but to say that it was 
“offensive and ultimately pointless” is 
going a little too far. Is the editori­
al board trying to insinuate that pay­
ing attention to an animal, even for 
30 minutes, is in no way beneficial? I 
am inclined to disagree with that posi­
tion. Any attention paid, whether to a 
dog, parakeet, or ostrich, leaves some 
impression of care and generosity. I ask 
the readers to envision an instance in 
which someone paid extra attention to 
them. Perhaps a teacher staying after 
school to help with homework, your 
parents or friends listening to you vent 
after a rough week, or maybe even your 
beloved household pet lounging beside 
you in appreciation for your love toward 
it. If your pet’s displays of love toward 
you left an impression, who’s to say your 
affection toward it won’t also produce 
some response?
As far as the price tag and time limit 
set for the event, I agree that it presents
awareness
a different message than what the 
Humane Society’s true goals were trying 
to achieve. Again, however, I ask that 
you remember there is no such thing as 
a “free lunch.” Sadly everything has a 
cost and that includes bringing dogs to 
Carnegie Mellon and supporting them 
at the kennels. If you stop and think 
about where that money may actually 
be going you will realize that in order 
to maintain the dog’s temporary home 
funding is necessary. If my $5 in any 
way aids in keeping those animals from 
being truly homeless then I’d pay 10 
times that much.
As previously stated, the event had 
some flaws. It would have been better 
if there had been no price tag, but let’s 
assume it’s going to a worthy cause. 
The advertisement of volunteer posi­
tions and donation opportunities would 
have been a good idea as well, but we 
can’t dwell on the past. Let’s instead 
try to get more activities like this one at 
Carnegie Mellon and fix the oversights 
that arose in the last event because every 
animal needs love, if only for 30 min­
utes. Those who jumped at the idea that 
these animals were being devalued and 
that no college student wants a dog may 
be surprised at how many students do 
want a pet to care for but just weren’t 
aware of the opportunities available. 
Now, due to this event, they are.

Keep our Social Security numbers secure
ments, Carnegie Mellon can make the 
choice to switch to randomly generated 
student ID numbers. Although stu­
dents can currently request randomly 
generated student ID numbers to use 
instead of their Social Security num­
bers, Carnegie Mellon should give every 
student a randomly generated number 
immediately. The administration will 
always need students’ Social Security 
numbers for financial information, but 
there is no need to use them to identify 
students on a general basis.
It won’t be easy. Colleges that make 
the switch have to use software to find 
the stored Social Security numbers and 
replace them with randomly generated 
ones, which proves to be an imprecise 
process. There’s also the problem of 
cleaning out professors’ computers and 
reassigning the ID numbers of alumni, 
who deserve to have their identities 
protected.
breaches, according to a Nov. 2 article in 
The Chronicle of Higher Education — we 
were one of them.
Earlier this semester, a Carnegie 
Mellon professor’s laptop containing 
students’ Social Security numbers was 
stolen.
Obviously, the university cannot 
tag students solely by their first and 
last names — there would be plenty 
of repeats — but using Social Security 
numbers is not the only alternative.
According to The Chronicle, many 
colleges, including Cornell University, 
the University of Pennsylvania, and the 
University of Colorado, have started 
using randomly generated student ID 
numbers instead of Social Security num­
bers. In fact, the use of Social Security 
numbers for student IDs is now illegal in 
over 30 states, though unfortunately not 
in Pennsylvania.
But regardless of the legal require-
In high school, most of us didn’t even 
know our Social Security numbers, and 
those of us who did were instructed to 
keep those precious nine digits under 
wraps. In college, though, all of that 
changed.
Carnegie Mellon students are trained 
to reveal parts — and often all — of 
their Social Security numbers, with 
little concern for their own personal 
privacy. Since Orientation, it’s been 
last-four-digits this, last-two-digits that. 
Getting into campus dorm rooms and 
registering for classes both require par­
tial Social Security numbers. On top of 
that, students are often asked to divulge 
their entire Social Security number 
when a university employee asks for a 
student ID number.
That’s because social security numbers 
are student IDs, and this is a problem.

many graphic, violent screenplays for 
class that concerned professors and stu­
dents alike; the 18-year-old gunman at 
Jokela High School made multiple vid­
eos depicting violence, calling for revo­
lutions, and using the songs that played 
on the Columbine shooters’ website.
We believe that it is the responsibility 
of schools to care for and watch the men­
tal and emotional health of students; 
we also believe that students should 
be mindful of content passing through 
their contemporaries’ most prominent 
form of connection and socialization, 
the Internet.
We don’t want vigilantes dominating 
universities, but we do want communi­
cators.
This past Wednesday, a student at 
Jokela High School in Finland shot and 
killed seven students and the princi­
pal before also killing himself. Though 
school shootings may seem to be a 
primarily American affair, they are not 
infrequent abroad: Since 1996, there 
have been 114 deaths as a result of school 
shootings in the United States, 49 in Eu­
ropean countries, eight in Yemen, three 
in Argentina, and three in Canada.
In the United States, school shootings 
are often catalysts for debate about gun 
control. However, the frequency of gun- 
related violence in schools in other coun­
tries — each with different gun control 
policies — is evidence that the problem 
is universal, and likely psychological.
Concern about political correctness
— not separating or calling attention 
to kids who display emotional instabil­
ity and violent tendencies — hinders 
communication between peers and 
authority figures, as well as different de­
partments in schools. It’s apparent that 
what is crucial is knocking down the 
walls that inhibit connection and com­
munication between departments like 
psychological services and educators; 
not that students be flagged and tagged, 
but rather that warning signs are heeded 
and, perhaps, interventions staged.

Decreasing meat consumption decreases suffering
In response to your article “Adjusting 
our extremist attitudes,” I would like 
to compliment Steve Weinberg for 
discussing the ethics of conscientious 
consumerism. If every American were to 
cut their meat consumption by half, as 
Weinberg suggests, billions of animals 
would be spared a lifetime of being 
forced into tiny cages and slaughtered 
for food. Not to mention, our impact on 
the environment would be significantly 
less, since a recent United Nations report 
showed that animal agriculture contrib­
utes more to global warming than all 
of the cars, trains, boats, and planes 
combined!
Certainly the reasons are there to want 
to pick vegetarian and vegan dishes, 
whether it is out of health concerns, in 
response to the environmental destruc­
tion of the meat industry, or of course 
cruelty to animals. Most people are hor­
rified to discover that animals killed for 
food often have abuses inflicted upon
them that would warrant felony cruelty 
to animals charges if they were done to 
dogs or cats. On today’s factory farms, 
chickens have their beaks sliced off, 
cattle and pigs are castrated with no 
painkillers, and many are even skinned 
and dismembered while still fully con­
scious. This is the product of an industry 
that refuses to make even the most basic 
changes in the way they raise and kill 
their animals.
With so many delicious vegetarian 
and vegan options, including many that 
are designed to the taste like meat, such 
as barbecue “riblets” and vegan pizza, 
there’s simply no excuse for continuing 
to support these horrific industries. For 
more information, visit www.peta2.com 
to request a free vegetarian starter kit, as 
well as stickers and a DVD.
Students ignore mayoral election
Last week Mayor Luke Ravenstahl 
was elected and Carnegie Mellon seems 
not to have noticed. Students, gener­
ally, ignored that an election was taking 
place.
While it’s likely that many students 
couldn’t have voted in the election 
because they aren’t registered in Penn­
sylvania, students who were eligible 
to vote were largely apathetic. Among 
the informed, a bigger issue was surely 
more troubling — neither of the candi­
dates focused on any issues that directly 
impacted students.
The Tartan did not endorse either
candidate because we felt that neither of 
them had plans that spoke to the biggest 
issues faced by students. While we did 
provide information on both candidates 
leading up to the election to encourage 
students to make their own decisions, 
we felt that the issues the candidates 
thought were the most important to stu­
dents really weren’t.
Now, like it or not, Ravenstahl will be 
our mayor for the next two years and 
it is unlikely that much in Pittsburgh 
will change. And we do think this is a 
problem, although not necessarily one 
that Mark DeSantis would have dealt
with much better. Pittsburgh is facing 
a lot of tough issues and a strong leader 
with a real plan would have been much 
appreciated.
With the choices as they were, we can 
hardly expect the students to care much 
about this election. Many students see 
Pittsburgh as a temporary home for a 
few years until they move on to bigger 
and better places. We only wish that 
a mayoral candidate, or better yet our 
mayor, cared enough about the students 
of Pittsburgh to convince them to partic­
ipate in the process of making Pittsburgh 
a place they could consider home.

Recreational 
equipment and 
the Tartanswiki
Sean Weinstock & Adi Jain
Hey Tartans. This week we 
sat down with the Student Dor­
mitory Council (SDC) to bring 
back the recreational equip­
ment we had on campus at the 
end of last year in a responsible 
manner. We also had conversa­
tions with the Computer Club as 
to how we can really populate 
the Tartanswiki which holds so 
much promise as a social tool 
for our current and prospective 
students.
Though controversial, the 
previous administration’s Public 
Rec Program was a success in 
the amount of fun it generated. 
Sunny days when everyone 
was playing soccer, football, 
throwing around Frisbees, and 
even riding around on the bikes 
made Carnegie Mellon a much 
more livable place. The only 
problem was that after a little 
while, all the equipment was 
either gone or broken. This is 
undoubtedly because of the pro­
gram’s lack of checks.
We believe in the virtues of fun 
on campus that the Public Rec 
Program engenders. Because of 
that, we’re working with SDC 
to re-implement the Public Rec 
Program in a more scaled-down 
and realistic manner. As soon as 
we buy the equipment (which 
should be early next semester), 
it will be available for check out 
in the various living areas across 
campus. All you’ll need to do to 
grab a ball or Frisbee is leave 
your student ID with the desk 
you’re borrowing the equipment 
from. This new system will not 
only allow the fun to happen, but 
it will also prevent any improper 
destruction or acquisition of the 
equipment from occurring.
Another holdover from last 
year is the Tartanswiki. At its in­
ception, expectations were high 
that it would solve our campus 
institutional memory issues. 
However, unfortunate circum­
stances and the lack of controls 
on the system caused it to crash 
and get spammed. We believe 
in the Tartanswiki. We don’t 
necessarily think that it should 
be the end-all for institutional 
memory at Carnegie Mellon 
(see last week’s article about the 
progress with OrgTracker), but 
we do feel that it can be a great 
social destination. We are work­
ing closely with the Computer 
Club, which created and oper­
ates the wiki, to figure out how 
we can populate it and make 
it something special. On that 
note, there will be a small fo­
rum next Saturday from 1:30 to 
2:00 in DH 1112 that you should 
come to if you have any opinions 
about the wiki. Stop by and talk 
it up. It’s only a half hour of your 
time, and it can lead to some­
thing awesome!

Sandra Lee: Homemade pies or homemade lies?
Marshall Roy
To the list of things that must, for the- 
sake of mankind, be stopped cold (global 
climate change, a nuclear North Korea, 
pre-emptive militarism, the persistent 
perversion of American English by the 
same citizens who demonize non-English- 
speaking immigrants, etc.), I humbly (but 
urgently) add: Sandra Lee.
Ms. Lee hosts Semi-Homemade, a show 
on the Food Network that teaches viewers 
how to buy prepared food at the supermar­
ket, arrange it prettily, and claim the work 
as their own.
Supposedly she studied at Le Cordon 
Bleu in France — but then, our president 
attended Yale.
In a recent Halloween episode, she 
actually instructed viewers to buy a 
pumpkin pie from the store, scoop out the 
filling for use on cookies, then discard the
crust. Another of her recipes calls for a 
hapless cheesecake to be similarly disem­
boweled.
Aside from the fact that the show is 
predicated on lying to your friends and 
loved ones, the entire premise is antitheti­
cal to the traditional ethos of a cooking 
show. Cooking shows are meant to teach 
and inspire, leave the viewer saying “Hey! 
With a pinch of know-how and a dash of 
moxie, I too can prepare a dish heretofore 
out of my culinary league!” But Ms. Lee’s 
show does the exact opposite: Her ditzy 
fakery devalues the time, energy, and — 
yes — the love that go into cooking. The 
tagline of her program might as well be 
“Why learn something when you can buy 
something? And then LIE ABOUT IT TO 
YOUR FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES?”
At the heart of Ms. Lee’s con is the 
tension between appearance and truth. 
She might produce dishes that appear to 
have been slaved over, and she may advo­
cate lies of omission by allowing guests 
to believe the dishes are homemade, but
all she’s really doing is eroding the bond 
between host and company, spitting in the 
face of the idea that it’s the thought and 
the effort that count.
Imagine her pernicious mendacity in 
other situations: Would you ever give 
someone a Gap sweater with the tag cut 
out and claim to have knitted it? Would 
you tell your fiancee that you personally 
mined her diamond out of the earth?
How long do you think The New Yankee 
Workshop would stay on PBS if its soft- 
spoken, flannel-clad craftsman of a host 
spent his half-hour time slot driving to Ikea 
and buying a credenza?
(By the way, real TV chefs accept assis­
tance from the grocery store all the time. 
But they keep it to a minimum and always 
own up to it.)
Of course, those other TV chefs aren’t 
perfect, either. For all her exquisite reci­
pes, Ina Garten’s favorite ingredient is 
condescension, as she reminds viewers to 
“buy really good vanilla,” and “never cook 
with a wine you wouldn’t want to drink!"
All that is true, but perhaps she could try 
delivering that advice with a little less 
unveiled disgust.
Then there’s Alton Brown, human 
culinary almanac, whose awesomely 
informative but zanily contrived show can 
sometimes verge on irritating; Giada De 
Laurentiis, who owes her screen presence 
to the Freudian appeal of her tendency to 
wear low-cut shirts and cook with lots of 
heavy cream; and Emeril Lagasse, whose 
top-notch recipes barely outweigh his 
lurching, Special Olympian delivery.
And then of course there’s the 
juggernaut. The inimitable, the unstop­
pable Rachael Ray. Eat a couple of her 
dishes in a row and you’ll pee chicken 
stock and poop cumin.
So nobody’s perfect — but until Sandra 
Lee came along, at least everyone was 
trying.

A PERSON’S OPINION
Compiled by Jesse Kummer
Rachael Clemmons
Celebrities are taking over the world. 
The evening news is rife with the latest 
on Nicole Richie’s pregnancy and Britney 
Spears’s daily train wreck of a life. Celebrity 
bloggers like Perez Hilton are infamous. 
Celebrities are going into other countries 
and adopting their children to save lives. 
Oh and, yes, while Bono and Madonna 
make attempts toward world peace, they 
would like you to wear pieces from their 
clothing lines — because you too can stop 
world hunger, one pair of jeans at a time.
Excuse me? These celebrities are clearly 
out of their minds. No, Donald Trump, 
despite my love of fine beef, I do NOT 
want your name-brand steak; despite the 
rigorous college lifestyle, I do NOT want 
your name-brand vodka. And why do 
the Coppolas have their own wine? Why 
is Carlos Santana, master of acoustics, 
hawking around women’s shoes? Why!?
It seems that the worst of the celebrity 
“Sell! Sell!” scheme lies within the modern 
music-making community. It’s gone way 
beyond Santana’s shoes. Take Diddy, for 
example. The notorious entrepreneur (You 
could call him an entrepreneur, right?) is 
not exactly renowned for his rapping skills, 
but he doesn’t even need rapping skills. 
His Sean John line is making him serious 
money, which he totally deserves because 
I’m sure he designed every piece. The artist 
formerly known as Puff Daddy is one of the 
masters of the “Sell! Sell!” scheme, making 
sure his name is plastered on everything, 
from a new fragrance to a new season of 
Making the Band. Diddy said it best with 
his Bad Boy crew in 1997: It’s all aboiut the 
Benjamins. Uh huh. Yeah.
Jennifer Lopez has made an art of sell­
ing her name. In the last year, she has 
had to be making money from her four 
fragrances, her clothing line, her subpar 
movies, her Spanish-language album, and 
her recently released English album. Is she 
having trouble putting food on the table? 
Even considering how poorly her last few 
movies and her English album have done, 
J. Lo makes plenty in royalties. So what’s 
the point? Lopez is sacrificing her art for 
some perfume. Like other celebrities, her 
extracurriculars seem to be hurting her 
career. Do you remember how amazing 
Lopez was in Selena? Before she started 
putting her nickname on a bottle of “fra­
grance”?
I suppose the overarching question is 
this: Why are celebrities determined to put 
their name on anything that sells? People 
are going beyond their field to model for 
this brand, or make their own brand. It

can only be about the money, because a 
lot of times, celebs do a poor job; and their 
fans, determined to support them in any 
way possible, end up smelling like a baby 
prostitute (a la Mean Girb).
Even though part of me cringes to think 
I could possibly end up wearing shoes 
by Jessica Simpson, there are celebrities 
whose efforts are commendable. I could 
question Sarah Jessica Parker’s new line 
of cheap clothing, curiously titled Bitten. 
Every piece in the line is less than $20 — 
Sarah Jessica Parker aims to please the 
people. Maybe Bitten isn’t a moneymak­
ing scheme, with such cheap clothing; 
but I’m not convinced — it could eas­
ily be a scheme for SJP to sell her name. 
I mean, she advertises for Garnier Fructis 
face products! She is definitely all about
selling her name. Gwen Stefani’s L.A.M.B. 
brand’s debut was integrated into her first 
solo album of the same name. Which was 
creative enough, until she started adver­
tising for HP and generally slapping her 
name on fashion trends. I cannot wear 
a black and white striped shirt without 
someone asking me if I’m trying to be 
Gwen Stefani.
Celebrities are getting out of hand. 
Maybe if they weren’t so focused on sell­
ing schemes and making money, their 
material would be better. When’s the last 
time Sarah Jessica Parker was in a serious 
blockbuster movie? Footloose? Jennifer 
Lopez’s new album, Brave, is really bad. 
The success of Diddy’s last album, Press 
Play, depended heavily on the guest stars 
— all he did was cosign in the background.
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
Celebrities, I love you and will continue 
to read celebrity gossip; but work on your 
art! Although I hate to admit it, it’s not 
all about making money. It’s about doing 
what you love.
And now to recover from my cliche, I’ll 
drink some of Nelly’s Pimp Juice (yes, it’s 
real) while wearing some Santana pumps 
and eating a Trump steak. And perhaps 
while I do all of this, I’ll call Trump and 
suggest he should endorse his own brand 
of hair plugs instead.
Rachael Clemmons (rclemmon@j is a 
professional writing major. She apologizes 
to any celebrity she may have offended in 
this article, but maintains that all celebri­
ties need to understand that the smell of 
baby prostitute is not a good thing.

On the ensuing kickoff, the 
Tartans forced another turn­
over as sophomore safety Josh 
Kresge stripped the ball from 
W & L’s Stuart Sitterson and 
Tartan junior defensive lineman 
Clay Crites pounced on it. Sivek 
found the end zone for the first 
time on the day, rushing the ball 
in from 1 yard out.
W & L stormed back with two 
touchdown drives to narrow 
their deficit to 29-21 at the 14:47 
mark of the fourth quarter. With 
it now only a one-possession 
game, the Tartans did what they 
do best: They ran the ball down 
the throat of W & L, using up over 
eight minutes of game clock be­
fore Marks nailed a 27-yard field 
goal to make the score 32-21 in 
favor of Carnegie Mellon.
W & L turned the ball over on 
downs on their next possession 
and Carnegie Mellon scored one 
more time. Gimson scampered 
35 yards on a running play to col­
lect his third touchdown of the 
game and to put the game out of
the reach of the Generals.
Gimson and Sivek both 
eclipsed the 1000-yard mark for 
the second year in a row in the 
game. Gimson rushed for 161 
yards to give him 1007 oh the 
season. Sivek barreled his way 
for 134yards, giving him 1033 on 
the year and 4101 career rushing 
yards. Sivek’s touchdown moves 
him into 18th place on the NCAA 
Division III scoring list with 354 
points in his career. Pantalone 
played well, completing five of 
his eight passes for 85 yards.
Defensively, senior safety Jon 
Scholl and junior linebacker Dan 
Falkenstein led the charge with 
nine tackles apiece. Crites and 
McGovern chipped in with seven 
tackles each.
The Tartan football team 
responded to their four-game 
losing streak with a four-game 
winning streak to finish the sea­
son over .500.
“For the defense, it started af­
ter the Randolph-Macon game 
when coach Bodnar, during 
films, simply asked certain play­
ers before each play if they did 
their job,” Reggie said. “It forced
us to acknowledge and own up 
to our mistakes. Then he told us 
we would end up being the first 
team in 30-some years to have a 
losing season, which was a real 
wake-up call. The seniors were

SOCCER, from A10
We just had two little lapses and 
then we were behind.”
Griffin’s scrappy play provided 
the equalizer in the 77th minute. 
First-year midfielder Adam Bo­
gus headed a cross toward the 
net only to have Griffin’s foot 
flick the ball past Bobcat junior 
goalkeeper Jay Herford. The 
goal gave Griffin a team-leading 
12 goals on the season.
“The second goal came at 
the end of a good play,” Grif­
fin said. “We were moving the 
ball around and got a nice cross 
over that Bogus got up and won. 
I was just trying to get forward 
in case the ball got free. The ball 
dropped right in front of me and I 
was able to kick it in right before 
the goalie could get it. Our team 
is definitely good at responding 
when we go down. We were cre­
ating chances all game — and 
especially when we went down 
2-1, we picked it up until we got
that second goal. Everyone on 
our team was confident we could 
come back, so I think that was a 
big part of it.”
Despite having a 19-9 edge 
in shots for the game, Carnegie 
Mellon wasn’t able to punch in 
a go-ahead goal late in regula­
tion. Frostburg took the kickoff 
to start the overtime and the 
tandem of Dotter and junior 
Gregg Laskow combined for the 
game-winner.
Dotter’s through- ball to 
Laskow beat the defense, and 
with only Bazin to beat, Laskow 
booted a shot that found its way 
into the back of the net to end 
the game a mere 11 seconds into 
overtime.
“Going into overtime, we still 
felt confident because we were 
creating chances and then they 
scored so quickly ... we didn’t 
know what hit us,” Griffin said.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s 
soccer team fell to the Frostburg 
State University Bobcats 1-0 dur­
ing an Eastern College Athletic 
Conference (ECAC) South quar­
terfinal match Wednesday.
The Tartans conclude the 
season with a 8-7-2 record 
overall. This one-game postsea­
son marked the collegiate finale 
for the three seniors: midfield­
ers Amanda Rose and Jessica 
Howard and forward Kasey 
Stever.
The Tartans dominated the 
flow of play for the first 10 min­
utes. Howard sent a cross into, 
the center of the 18-yard box 
for Carnegie Mellon’s offense to 
run onto, but Bobcat senior goal­
keeper Stephanie Gwinn met the 
ball and Stever at her feet, saving

while Amaechi contributed seven 
blocks. Brackin accumulated 
nine kills, while first-year middle 
hitter Caroline Size added eight.
The Tartans faced the top- 
seeded Johns Hopkins Blue 
Jays in the championship match 
Sunday. The Blue Jays defeated 
Washington & Jefferson College 
in the other semifinal match 3-0 
to advance to the championship. 
Johns Hopkins boasted a 25-5 
season record going into the 
match, while the Tartans’ record 
stood at 22-15.
“I think we all felt we deserved 
to be the number-one seed, even 
though Johns Hopkins was. Their 
schedule didn’t compare to ours,” 
Toney said. “They had a great re­
cord, but they played really bad 
teams. Our record doesn’t look 
very good but if you look at the 
quality of the competition, you 
can see our coach matched us up 
against lots of great teams. Of 
our losses, the majority was to 
nationally or regionally ranked 
teams.”
The Tartans downed the Blue 
Jays in a well-fought, back-and-
a golden scoring opportunity for 
Carnegie Mellon.
Moments later, Frostburg first- 
year forward Stephanie Parker 
took on Tartan junior defender 
Sarah DeWath, and struck a shot 
from 25 yards out that first-year 
Carnegie Mellon goalkeeper 
Anya Rosen deflected right for a 
corner. The Bobcats’ kick dropped 
in the box and Frostburg tried to 
finish, but missed the frame.
Rosen was kept active, mak­
ing three saves prior to the lone 
goal scored in the 27th minute. 
Frostburg sophomore Lauren 
Lentine came up the right flank 
and passed a through ball into 
the center to teammate Amanda 
Drake. Drake slid it into the lower 
left corner of the goal just seconds 
after entering the game from off 
of the bench. Forty seconds later, 
Rose attempted to retaliate and 
rifled a shot at Gwinn but to no 
avail.
forth match. The Tartans won 
the first game 30-23, but the 
Blue Jays retaliated and took the 
second game 30-21. Carnegie 
Mellon took game three 30-22, 
and Johns Hopkins won game 
four 30-22.
The championship title came 
down to game five, which was 
won by the Tartans 15-13 after 
an attack error cost Johns Hop­
kins the game.
Brackin received the Most 
Valuable Player award for the 
championships. Brackin and 
Amaechi led the Tartan offense 
with 14 kills apiece. Stepp fol­
lowed with nine, while Size 
added eight to the team total.
Carter logged 57 assists and 
14 digs during the match. Grif­
fin added 25 digs, while Stepp, 
Fatigati, and sophomore right 
side hitter Julie Ng each recorded 
nine digs.
The volleyball team ends 
the reason with a 23-15 record 
overall. The young team will 
graduate only two seniors: Stepp 
and Toney.
“Kate Stepp and I are the only 
seniors, but we both have posi­

The second half appeared to 
be more promising for Carnegie 
Mellon as the team came out with 
a revived spirit and intensity. The 
team cranked up the offense and 
stabilized the defense, creating 
scoring opportunities for junior 
forward Abigail Coffin, Rose, 
and Stever to capitalize in the at­
tacking third.
“It was hard ending the sea­
son with a loss,” assistant coach 
Betsy Warren said. “It was even 
harder to see the careers of our 
three amazing seniors not end 
in the way they deserved to go 
out. This was a tough season in 
respect to the demanding sched­
ule and high level of competition 
we faced. I was really impressed 
with the team camaraderie and 
the players’ ability to work to­
gether and play for each other.”

“During the season, practices are 
focused around a team dynamic
throughout the match.
“This season we had the 
chance to play some very com­
petitive teams, like Denison and 
the University of Rochester, and 
proved that we could compete 
with them,” sophomore mid­
fielder Eleonore Valencia said. 
“I am so lucky to have had the 
opportunity to play with such 
talented and hardworking girls, 
especially our three seniors who 
will be leaving a large void that 
will be very hard to fill.”
“We have some great talent and 
dedicated players who are will­
ing to push themselves and their 
teammates to improve,” War­
ren said. “We have a lot of good 
things to build off of from this

“Grove City is probably one 
of our biggest rivals,” senior co­
captain Andy Douglass said. “In 
the past some of our meets have 
been very close. Unfortunately, 
this year they lost some of their 
best swimmers.”
The swimming and diving 
teams will return home Fri­
day when they host Franklin & 
Marshall College, Washington

so we are looking .forward to 
the chance to try to beat them 
this year,” Douglass said. “[The 
women] tied F & M last year, so 
they are looking forward to the 
chance to beat them this year.”

The Carnegie Mellon women’s 
volleyball team ended its fall 
season last week with an East­
ern College Athletic Conference 
(ECAC) South Championship 
title. The Tartans defeated Penn 
State-Altoona, New York Univer­
sity, and Johns Hopkins Univer­
sity en route to the Division III 
title.
The third-ranked Tartans
began their championship bid 
Wednesday when they hosted 
sixth-ranked Penn State-Al­
toona in a quarterfinal match. 
Carnegie Mellon demolished the 
Lions 3-0 with scores of 30-21, 
30-14, 30-23. The Lions ended 
their season with a 21-9 record 
overall.
Senior outside hitter Kate Stepp 
led the Tartans with 12 kills dur­
ing the match. Sophomore middle 
hitter Jessica Brackin followed 
with 10, and junior middle hit­
ter Chisom Amaechi added nine

kills to the Tartan total. Brackin 
also contributed a career-high 13 
blocks, eight of which were solo.
Sophomore setter Samantha 
Carter collected 43 assists, while 
first-year defensive specialist 
Cameron Griffin totaled 17 digs. 
Sophomore Cara Fatigati added 
nine digs to the Tartan total.
“ECACs were a fun way to end 
the season,” senior middle hitter 
Abbie Toney said. “We had re­
ally low-key practices all week, 
and the games were relatively no 
pressure.”
Carnegie Mellon hosted the 
semifinals Saturday, facing the 
seventh-ranked NYU Violets. 
The Violets upset the second 
seed, New Jersey City University, 
3-1 to make it to the semifinal 
match. NYU’s championship run 
ended in the semifinals as Carn­
egie Mellon defeated the Violets 
3-0 (30-19, 30-20, 30-22).
Carter had 31 assists and eight 
digs in the win. Griffin led the 
Tartans defensively with 20 digs,

Men’s soccer season ends with 3-2 overtime loss
by Doug Fricker
Senior Sports Staff
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
soccer team saw its season come 
to an end in an unfortunate fash­
ion in the quarterfinals of the 
ECAC South Tournament. The 
Tartans hosted Frostburg State 
University Wednesday and lost 
3-2 in overtime, as the Bobcats 
needed only 11 seconds of over­
time to score the game-winning 
goal.
A quiet first half saw the 
Tartans strike first in the 13th 
minute. Sophomore forward 
Ricky Griffin crossed the ball 
from the left side toward the 
front of the goal and a Frostburg 
defender slid and kicked the ball 
into his own net to put Carnegie 
Mellon up 1-0.
“The first goal was a little lucky 
because they kicked it into their 
own net,” Griffin said. “However, 
we had a couple guys in the box 
ready to put it in if he didn’t.”
The score remained 1-0
heading into halftime with the 
Tartans holding a 7-2 edge in 
shots. Frostburg mounted a furi­
ous comeback, netting two goals 
within 80 seconds of each other 
to tie, and then take the lead.
Frostburg sophomore Steven 
Jacobsen leapt and headed in 
a cross from junior Adam Gra­
cia at the 66:24 mark that went 
over the head of Carnegie Mel­
lon junior goalkeeper Matthew 
Bazin. The Bobcats took the lead 
at the 67:44 mark when senior 
Kenny Dotter blasted a shot from
the right sideline that somehow 
managed to go between the right 
post and Bazin and into the back 
corner of the net.
“We really needed to get [a] 
second goal when we were up 
1-0,” Griffin said. “We had a lot 
of good chances, especially at the 
beginning of the second half. It 
would’ve been a different game 
if we had just gotten that second 
goal, but the longer it took the 
longer they were still in the game.
Men’s cross country j

Staffwriter
Junior Brian Harvey won the 
NCAA Division III Mideast Cross 
Country Regional Championship 
Saturday, beating nearly 300 
runners. Harvey finished the 8K 
race at Lehigh University with a 
personal best time of 24:44, be­
coming the first Carnegie Mellon 
student to win a regional.
Harvey led the men’s team to 
a third-place finish overall out of 
41 teams, with 71 points. Haver- 
ford College won the men’s team 
championship with 45 points. 
Allegheny College took second 
with 52 points. Haverford and 
Allegheny received automatic 
bids to the NCAA Division III Na­
tional Championships.
For the Tartans, fifth-year 
Geoff Misek and sophomore 
Dario Donatelli finished close 
behind Harvey, taking 12th and 
15th overall with times of 25:11 
and 25:15, respectively.
“My performance was okay, 
but next week I’m going to make 
it a point to not let a couple of 
those Allegheny kids beat me,”
Misek said.
Junior Breck Fresen and first- 
year J.P. Allera placed 18th and 
25th overall with times of 25:19 
and 25:36, respectively. Ju­
niors Ryan Anderson and Mike 
Condon finished 35th and 54ih 
overall with times of 25:43 a#d 
26:28.
* “With six of seven runners 
well under 26:00 and listed as 
All-Regional Runners, along with 
Harvey’s victory, we showed that 
we can hold our own with the 
best of them,” Anderson said. ,4
On the women’s side, despite 
having a young team, the Tar­
tans finished 16th out of 37 
teams with 522 points in the 6K 
race.
Every runner on the women’s 
team finished her season with'a 
personal best time. Junior Car­

Sports Editor
The men’s and women’s swim­
ming and diving teams defeated 
Grove City College Saturday in 
their second dual meet of the 
season.
The women’s team dismantled 
the Wolverines 180-133, while 
the men’s team won by a score of 
171-128.
The Carnegie Mellon women’s 
200-yard medley relay “A” team 
opened the meet with a win 
(1:53.47). The team consisted of 
first-years Molly Evans and Lau­
ren Gumbel, sophomore Sara 
Andrews, and senior Lauren 
Connell.
“Our medley relay is a really 
young group and swimming re­
ally well this year,” Connell said. 
“The team has a lot more depth 
with the addition of a big, tal­
ented freshman class, and that’s 
really exciting for the future of 
the team.”
Evans continued her standout
rookie year, winning the 100- 
yard backstroke (58.58) and the 
500-yard freestyle (5:09.66r). 
Her backstroke time set a new 
school record and is a prelimi­
nary qualifying time for the 
NCAA championships.
Senior Sarah Lam took third 
in the 100-yard backstroke 
(1:07.57), while junior Becky 
Martz took second in the 500- 
yard freestyle with a time of 
5:31.76.
Carnegie Mellon swept the 
1000-yard freestyle and the 200- 
yard butterfly. First-year Noelle 
Helmstetter won the 1000-yard 
freestyle with a time of 11:18.53, 
while senior co-captain Xiao-Lan 
Wong took second (11:29.00), 
and junior Tina Daup placed 
third (11:32.30).
Senior co-captain Anna Koch-

Senior Robert Gimson (#21) runs with the ball during Saturday’s game 
against W & L. Gimson passed the 1000-yard mark during the game.
by Doug Fricker
Senior Sports Staff
The Carnegie Mellon defense 
forced six Washington & Lee 
turnovers, and the running back 
tandem of seniors Robert Gim­
son and Travis Sivek propelled 
the football team to a 39-21 
victory on senior day at Gesling 
Stadium. The Tartans finish the 
regular season at 6-4, courtesy 
of their current four-game win­
ning streak, and now await news 
today of a possible ECAC bowl 
game.
“Defensively, we wanted to 
stop the run and force them to 
tfyrow the ball,” senior defensive
nose guard Mike Reggie said. “As 
the game went on, they made 
some adjustments and we missed 
some tackles that let them stay in 
the game — and, as a defense, 
missed tackles will always hurt 
you. Once our offense put up 
some points and they started 
getting into desperation mode 
with passing, we knew we could 
handle them, especially after we 
had put their starting quarter­
back out of the game early in the 
first quarter.”
With 8:46 remaining in the 
first quarter, the Tartans struck 
first on a 3-yard Gimson run, 
capping off an eight-play drive 
(all runs) that started because 
of an interception by senior
4
linebacker Dan Shamash that he 
returned 12 yards to the W & L 
31. The Tartans failed on the ex­
tra point because of a bad snap.
W & L (6-3) used 12 plays to 
go 70 yards and take the lead in 
the middle of the second quar­
ter. Quarterback Patrick Rouse 
completed a 26-yard pass to Jack 
Martin in the end zone to put the 
Generals up 7-6.
Carnegie Mellon fired back 
with a quick touchdown drive, 
marching 65 yards in seven plays 
to take the lead back for good at 
12-7. Gimson notched his second 
touchdown run of the day, this 
time from 4 yards out.
The Tartans added to their 
12-7 halftime lead with a 25- 
yard field goal from junior kicker 
Colin Marks with 5:52 remain­
ing in the third quarter. Junior 
cornerback Steve McGovern 
ended the next W & L drive by 
intercepting Rouse and return­
ing the ball 26 yards to the W & L 
8-yard line.
Sophomore quarterback Phil 
Pantalone converted the Gener­
als’ miscue into points with his 
4-yard touchdown run, putting 
the Tartans up 22-7.
“Turnovers always play a big 
part in any game,” Reggie said. 
“Chances are, if you can force 
more takeaways than you give 
up, you’ll win. It was great see­
ing Dan Shamash getting a pick 
on senior day and it’s always 
exciting when Steve McGovern 
picks one, because he always has 
potential to take it to the house

The man [hiding] behind the raptor
Randall Munroe, artist of webcomic xkcd visits campus
Just one day before the Fall Concert, Wiegand 
Gymnasium was already packed. On the stage: a 
kite, an oscilloscope, a decorated harp, a projector, 
a couch, a skee-ball alley, and one of the staples of 
geek culture, Randall Munroe.
Munroe worked for NASA before and after his 
graduation from Christopher Newport University.
His contract was not renewed in 2006, so he turned 
his hobby, a webcomic called xkcd, into a full- <¦ 
time endeavor. Most of his minimalist, stick-figure 
strips featured mathematics or computer science 
jokes, while others had deep philosophical or 
romantic thoughts not meant to be humorous at all. 
Occasionally, he would grab Internet-wide attention 
with elaborate mappings of Internet culture.
Fans have, on numerous occasions, reproduced 
events in Munroe’s strips: smuggling chessboards 
with glued-down pieces onto amusement rides; 
or calling for citations in true Wikipedian fashion 
("citation needed"), as a member of the audience so 
boldly produced on the spot. Munroe’s fan devotion 
has progressed to the point where, for one strip, he 
included GPS coordinates and a date. On that day, 
hundreds of fans congregated and welcomed Munroe 
on.those coordinates, a playground in Boston.
Adding to the artist’s character, Munroe’s webcomic 
reflects an apparent obsession with potential raptor 
attacks (inspired by Jurassic Park) and the Guitar 
Hero video game series. Behind Munroe during the 
entire lecture, though covered by a projector screen 
on stage, was a hulking silhouette of a raptor.
Munroe attracted 800 fans to a crammed Wiegand 
Gymnasium. At 25, Randall Munroe looked like 
he could have been anyone in the audience, but 
everyone sitting below knew him by sight. There 
was a noticeable shift in the audience as they first 
listened to him speak.
After the initial applause, Munroe commented 
that he had wanted to visit Carnegie Mellon, 
and had been consistently receiving more e-mail 
invitations to lectures here than anywhere else.
He then referenced and added more jokes to his 
previous strips, one of which featured a fictional 
scatterplot association between blood-alcohol 
content and programming ability. He announced that 
programmers with a BAC of 0.1337% are the most 
proficient.
Later, Munroe described a college prank he 
performed at CNU, alongside his hobby of kite 
photography (attaching cameras to kites). He flew 
a kite very high over a first-year dorm, with a long 
string tied near the top of the kite line. The kite and 
the kite line were essentially invisible at their height, 
and perplexed first-years gathered around a string 
held vertically with no apparent object above it. One 
girl eventually concluded that a clear dome covered 
the campus, Munroe explained.
Remembering that fans tend to reproduce what he 
imagines, Munroe spoke of an image that he has 
waiting for somebody to actually create: Suspended
by a system of weights and pulleys attached to 
beams, two people engaging in a light saber fight 
in midair. Citing fencing as one-dimensional 
sword fighting and regular sword fighting as 
2-D, Munroe described this as a 3-D sword-fight, 
looking suggestively at the ceiling of Wiegand.
A student wielding a green laser pointer in the 
audience marked out possible spots, to everyone's 
amusement.
Munroe also made several important 
announcements. Recalling how readers have often 
e-mailed him for grammar and spelling mistakes 
on his strip, he created a new grammar standard 
on quotations, allowing question marks and 
exclamation marks inside or outside quotations 
(or both) depending on context. Munroe justified 
his standard by citing the lack of a legal governing 
body for the English language, unlike French; thus, 
he claimed publicly accepted standards of language 
like The Elements of Style hold no authority over 
his. Exploiting this logic, he also designated himself 
the president of the Internet, as no such office 
existed, and made it a non-voting position.
Among other raptor-related questions in the info 
session, Munroe was asked of his marital status, 
to which he bashfully admitted his difficulty in 
striking up conversation with the opposite sex 
in the academic circles of Boston, as everyone 
there knows his jokes by heart and would often 
finish them from mid-sentence. However, Munroe 
explained, this a small price to pay for entertaining 
the masses.
To everyone’s applause, Munroe accepted an 
invitation to participate in Capture the Flag 
with Stuff, a rule-heavy variation on the classic 
playground game put on by campus organization 
KGB.

Everything you need to know
About rooming with friends and Mr. Wrong 
Dear Myrtle, Dear Myrtle,
Jesse Kummer I Photo Staff
Webcomic artist Randall Munroe participates in a 
Q&A with Carnegie Mellon students.
My roommate and I have been 
good friends since freshman 
year, before we were roommates. 
This is my second year rooming 
with her, and, over the past year, 
she has stopped wanting to hang 
out with me and will often ditch 
me to hang out with her other 
friends. It seems that, because 
we’re roommates and we see 
each other all the time, she 
doesn’t feel the need to hang 
out with me and always seems 
so excited to see everyone else. 
This makes sense, but I feel like 
we’re not good friends anymore, 
and I don’t want this to happen. 
What can I do to save/renew our 
friendship?
—Worried About Roommate 
Friendship
Hello there WARF,
Unfortunately, there’s nothing like 
rooming together to break up a good 
friendship. It’s a very rare couple 
of friends who can room., together 
and remain close. Being in close 
proximity puts all kinds of stress on 
a friendship - all the little things 
that you don’t mind in a friend (like 
gum-popping, leaving dirty dishes 
lying around, watching Bill O’Reilly, 
or plucking eyebrow hairs out one 
by one and shrieking each time) 
drive you absolutely up the wall in 
a roommate. And you’ve also got 
it right that being.with one person 
24/7 can make you crave a change
— even if nothing that person does 
drives you nuts. So the best thing 
you can do for this friendship is to 
stop being roommates. With any 
luck, you’ll find that a little distance 
is all your friendship needs. Of 
course, there’s a slim chance you’re 
just drifting apart, but there’s no 
reason to accept that until it’s the 
only possibility. Until you can move 
out (I’d wait until the end of the 
semester, at least, if not the end of 
the year), talk to her and tell her how 
you feel. Also, do some fun stuff 
together to remind yourselves how 
great it is to actually get along with 
your roommate — have a movie 
night, cook your favorite meals 
together, or redecorate your room.

I have a great boyfriend — stable, 
cute, sweet, sensible, gentle, 
pre-med — only problem is, he 
doesn’t excite me. He should 
excite me — he’s right in every 
way — but I keep getting the 
hots for bad boys, married boys, 
boys who only want me for my 
body, and even criminals (once). 
What’s the matter with me?
—Seeking Mr. All Wrong
Dear SMAW,
The first thing you have to do is 
leave your boyfriend, now. He may 
be “right in every way,” but he’s 
obviously not right for you, and 
you’re only hurting somebody who 
seems perfectly nice by staying in 
a relationship that does nothing for 
you whatsoever. After you're single, 
think carefully to yourself about 
whether you really want a committed 
relationship right now. Maybe what 
you need at the moment is to date 
a bunch of different guys (preferably 
one after the other, not all at once, 
as you are now) and learn more 
about yourself in the process before 
tying yourself down to someone 
you’re not into. Or maybe you just 
want all these "bad boys” because 
your “good boy” wasn’t doing it 
for you. If you look hard and long,
I think you'll find someone who’s 
both right in every way and a little bit 
naughty and exciting. Don’t commit 
to anyone who doesn’t meet both 
criteria.

Suitcase Royale unpacks in Pittsburgh
Australian troupe comes to the School of Drama
The Suitcase Royale, a touring theater company from 
Melbourne, Australia, visited the School of Drama on 
Saturday. The Royale, made up of Miles O'Neill, Joseph 
O'Farrell, and Glen Walton, is a young company, brought to 
the city by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust as part of this year's 
themed celebration of Australian artists. The members have 
only recently graduated from Victoria College in Melbourne, 
Australia, where they pursued double majors in theater 
and, respectively, English (O'Neill), contemporary dance 
(O'Farrell), and communications media (Walton). During the 
question-and-answer session at Carnegie Mellon, the Royale 
members answered questions about their.recent success at 
international theater festivals such as the Edinburgh Fringe, 
where their performances generated praise from critics and 
audiences.
The group’s success, like its work, has taken an 
unconventional route. From performing atop a bar 
at the Melbourne Fringe Festival, where the Royale 
won the Audience Choice Award, to Edinburgh, 
the company’s rise to critical acclaim has been fast. 
Despite this, the trio's attitude during the session here 
was relaxed and humble as the actors spoke of their experiences 
at school, their creative process, and their plans for the future.
The Royale's performances are shaped by the actors’ dislike 
of aspects of their traditional conservatory training and the 
professional theater world in general, but they agreed that 
school was a valuable experience. "Even though we went to 
a sort of mediocre university, school gave us access to these 
great things,” said O’Neill. “Black-box theaters. Tech guys 
always hanging around willing to talk to us. Extension cords. 
That helped a lot."
The actors' work onstage reflects their diverse training and 
interests: incorporating music; quick, clever dialogue; and 
physical movement so exaggerated it sometimes evokes 
choreography. The Royale's performances are exhilaratingly
Casting the
Sculptor Rachel Whiteread
Rachel Whiteread, a pre-eminent British sculptor, spoke last 
Tuesday at the Carnegie Lecture Hall. Whiteread gained 
international recognition in the 1990s by casting the negative . 
space of objects as small as furniture to structures as grand as 
houses. While reflecting such strange proportions, the artist’s 
haunting quality of work also portrays her interest in memory 
and death. With her cast pieces, Whiteread strives to carry 
what she called "the residue of years and years of use.” Her 
casts of voids made solid, which are nostalgically evocative, 
prove that there is a certain appeal in nothingness turned 
tangible.
Her 2002 piece “Untitled (Domestic),” which was co­
purchased by the Carnegie Museum of Art and Albright-Knox 
Museum Gallery of Buffalo, N.Y., was recently added to the 
Carnegie’s local collection. Although the museum temporarily
rough, falling under the category of D.I.Y. The set is a 
harvest of the street, the living room, and the junkyard, with 
transitions often signified by cardboard signs, the passing of 
time with a handheld moon. The fake blood is an aromatic 
blend of food coloring and vinegar, and green masking tape at 
one point becomes a moustache.
But what distinguishes the Suitcase Royale from many of 
the "experimental” D.I.Y. theater collectives or performers 
is the actors' commitment to craft onstage. This isn’t 
craft as it appears in traditional theater format, but skilled 
timing, complex narrative technique, and consistently 
powerful energy. Their tight, controlled pacing and delivery 
show an understanding of theater and the importance of
communication with the audience — a sensibility that many 
D.I.Y. acts, despite their high energy, miss.
The Royale draws inspiration from various sources outside 
traditional drama. “We don't really see much theater," O’Neill 
said. “We draw more from films and music."
“I don’t know if that's entirely true; we watch plays," O'Farrell 
interjected.
“We haven’t decided whether we watch theater or not," 
Walton concluded, to laughter from the audience.
Although theater attendance is somewhat of a gray area, the 
influence from other genres is clear. “We really wanted to be 
a rock band,” Walton said. “That didn’t work out, so we were
housed Whiteread’s “Untitled (One Hundred Spaces)" in 
1995 and owns her "Untitled (Yellow Bath)” (2002), "Untitled 
(Domestic)’’ is the first large-scale piece to arrive on the site. 
The piece, which is a plaster cast of a staircase in Admiral 
Lotd Nelson’s 18th-century London town house, is starkly 
white, angular, and monumental. The familiar form of the 
stairwell is made strange by a 180-degree turn, and the 
effect of the sculptural reversal is disorienting. The viewer 
is stunned by the simultaneous beauty and simplicity of the 
space.
As for her lecture on Tuesday, Whiteread began with slides 
of her influences and early artwork. This left the attendees, 
mostly a mix of Carnegie Mellon students and faculty, 
only somewhat satisfied; they commended Whiteread’s 
wide array of slides, but criticized her lack of conceptual
like, ‘Hey, theater!”'
“We're influenced a lot by film — a story unfolding in a series 
of frames," added O'Farrell. "We start with images we find 
striking, then build a story from those images."
Though this method may sound theory-driven or detached, 
the Royale in action is anything but abstract. Last week, the 
troupe’s performances at the Warhol Museum of its most 
recent piece, Chronicles of a Sleepless Moon, burst off the 
stage with rampant energy. O'Neill, O'Farrell, and Walton 
used slapstick and vaudevillian physical techniques to tell the 
bizarre story of a newsman, a butcher, and a mad doctor who 
travel under the earth in a machine fueled by cow blood in a 
mysterious but noble quest to map the underground. 
Attending audiences welcomed the scrambling energy 
and madcap, nonsensical plot of the piece, which had 
some sold-out shows.
The friendship and rapport between the membersof 
the Royale was clear from their easy overlapping in 
the School of Drama meeting, and their work onstage 
shows their shared enthusiasm for what they do, as artists 
and as friends. They are optimistic about their future as a 
company and want to continue experimenting.
The Suitcase Royale performs at the Andy Warhol Museum on 
Sunday at 6 p.m.

explanation. Corey Werner, a sophomore art student who 
recently conducted research on the artist, commented, "I 
was disappointed that she didn't address the importance of 
the materials and the concept of her art.” Perhaps Whiteread 
is accustomed to speaking to audiences who are solely 
interested in the product, and not the process, of her work.
Although it is too late to hear her lecture, Whiteread's work 
is still available at the Carnegie Museum of Art. The inverted 
staircase, "Untitled (Domestic),” is a perfect example of her 
passion: immortalizing the ephemeral.

Down soars on Over the Under and Jay-Z goes GangsteriI5!fPaPfhOL;se"On Scottish bands
Down, Down III: Over the Under
"We've been changed by the season of the storm...”
That line, from the Down song “On March The Saints,” 
says less about the band that wrote it and more about 
their love and home: NOLA. New Orleans, La., is the 
root of what makes this band, so much so that it is the 
name of their first album. That first record remains in 
my MP3 player years after it was that disc in my CD 
player, as I'm sure it would have been that LPin my 
record player had it come out decades ago. That would 
have made perfect sense, actually; if any band embodies 
the spirit of Zeppelin and Messrs. Pink and Floyd- 
today, it is Down, composed of Phil Anselmo, Pepper 
Keenan, Kirk Windstein, Rex Brown, and Jimmy Bower 
(the drummer, known for his Bower Power). Just like 
Zeppelin went from acoustic to pillaging Vikings all on 
the same album, Down has evolved from sheer power 
on NOLA to acid rock with Down II: A Bustle in Your 
Hedgerow, to true Southern gentlemen on the band’s 
latest, Down IE: Over the Under.
What has changed these young men into the musicians 
they are today cannot be pinned down to one event, 
although Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath looms 
large over this work. So does the loss of Dimebag 
Darrell Abbott, the one and only genius that was Down 
vocalist Phil Anselmo’s foil in Pantera. While Dimebag, 
a guitarist, was the happy-go-lucky Kiss fan whose 
ability would eclipse Pantera’s other members, Anselmo 
was the dark, brooding, and utterly fascinating lead 
singer whose vocal style would lay the foundation for 
every hardcore-meets-metal group at a Hot Topic store 
near you. This dynamic was cut short in 2001, when 
Dimebag was shot on stage in Columbus, Ohio, as his 
brother played drums behind him. Anselmo had been 
feuding with Dimebag before his murder, and the raw 
emotions experienced between the two camps evolved 
for Anselmo into grief, and that can be felt on Over the 
Under.
Sadness and loss would figure to be the main themes 
of Over the Under, but there is more to the story than 
that. Over the Under asks the larger question: Can 
you ever truly come home again? And, if not, can you 
accept walking away, asking nothing in return? The last 
song, which I believe will become Down’s "Stairway 
to Heaven,” asks that very question. It is the members 
of Down at their finest hour — not at their heaviest, 
because nothing will ever recapture NOLA; and perhaps 
not at their most experimental, such as JT, but at their 
finest as musicians.

Jay-Z, American Gangster
Here’s a rap analogy you've heard before: Jay-Z is to rap 
as Michael Jordan is to the NBA.
The comparison began as early as the late '90s, when 
Brooklyn rapper Jay-Z (real name: Sean Carter) released 
five albums between 1996 and 1999 (including 1996's 
Reasonable Doubt, still considered one of the finest
rap albums of all time). Each one achieved worldwide 
critical acclaim and platinum status; like Jordan, Carter 
was the undisputed king of his craft.
With seemingly nothing more to accomplish in the field 
of rap, Jay “retired” in 2004, shortly after the release 
of The Black Album. After becoming CEO of Def Jam 
records, Jay un-retired in 2006 with his album Kingdom 
Come. Enter a new analogy: Jay-Z is to 2006’s Kingdom 
Come as Jordan is to the number 45.
But the analogy didn’t hold. While Kingdom Come was 
lyrically bland and musically unadventurous, Jordan 
was still exuberant and successful, winning three 
championships in a row.' Meanwhile, Jay looked more 
like Jordan on the Wizards (wearing number 23): a 
former legend, failing for the first time in a long time.
But now Jay-Z is back. On Tuesday, he released 
American Gangster, a concept album based on the 
Ridley Scott film of the same name. He claims the power 
struggles in the movie reminded him a bit of his own 
life, where he used drug dealing and rapping to get past 
poverty and police corruption.
His album,' however, is filled with confusing paradoxes 
that significantly detract from the music. Most 
obvious of these is the simple idea of Jay-Z putting 
out a concept album about his own life: Hasn’t he 
been rapping about himself, his life, and his struggles ¦ 
since his first record? Isn’t the crux of rap music, after 
all, about telling one’s own story through music and 
lyrics? Why is Jay making a “concept album” based on 
what he’s been rapping about his whole career? This 
redundancy emerges most blatantly in “Hello Brooklyn 
2.0,” where Jay, for the umpteenth time, pledges 
allegiance to his favorite borough of all. Jay proudly 
proclaims, "Hello Brooklyn, if we had a daughter, you 
know what I’d name her? Brooklyn Carter.” Really Jay? 
Would you really name your daughter Brooklyn? No, you 
wouldn’t.
Redundancies and inconsistencies aside, Jay is still a 
magnificent storyteller, painting vivid pictures of his 
own life through words and music. (He forgot this on 
Kingdom Come.) On "Roc Boys (And The Winner Is)...,” 
Jay’s content is simple and celebratory: “Oh, what a 
feeling/I’m feeling life/You ain’t even gotta bring your 
purses out/We the dope boys of the year/drinks is on the 
house." It’s a simpler concept, but over the sizzling horn 
patterns and oozing bass line, it feels like Jay’s right 
next to you at New York’s finest bar. And that’s when 
he’s is at his best; it’s not when he’s trying to make 
grandiose conclusions about his far-from-finished music 
career, it’s the lines where Jay is just being Jay that 
really score.

radio station.
Andrew Carnegie, forefather of our university and lover of plaid, instilled 
our institution with a strange tie to his homeland, Scotland. I present five 
songs by Scottish groups.
Boards of Canada, “Turquoise Hexagon Sun” “Turquoise 
Hexagon Sun” is the second track on Boards of Canada’s Hi Scores: 
a five-minute masterpiece that has aged incredibly well. I know that 
it’s made with machines, but BOC fools me, fusing organic fuzz of real 
space, murmuring of a crowd and emotion with a space-age melody. 
“Turquoise” is a BOC classic, displaying the band’s uncanny ability to 
toe the line between ambient, psychedelic, and even disco.
Mogwai, “Stanley Kubrick” Glasgow post-rockers Mogwai released 
EP in 1999, having already garnered significant attention for their music. 
“Stanley Kubrick” is the foundation for EP, starting off with the slow 
patter of drums and murmurs, then arching into the band’s signature 
rich bass and guitar twang. Well-balanced distortion, drones, vocals and 
epic cymbal crashes elevate “Stanley Kubrick” to be one of Mogwai’s 
finest tracks.
The Twilight Sad, “Cold Days from the Birdhouse” With a powerful 
voice and thick Scottish accent, vocalist James Graham is what really 
sets The Twilight Sad and their album Fourteen Autumns & Fifteen 
Winters apart from other bands in the same vein (think The Arcade Fire 
crossed with My Bloody Valentine). “Cold Days from the Birdhouse” 
opens their album with intensity, as Graham shouts “Where are your 
manners?" to the end, and “Cold Days" is among many awesome 
songs on a surprising debut album.
Belle and Sebastian, “Wrapped Up in Books” If you’ve seen 
John Cusack in High Fidelity, you’ve heard long-time indie darlings 
Belle and Sebastian. Their signature sound is understated indie pop, 
complete with rock organ and twee vocals. What I like most about Belle 
and Sebastian is their ability to tell serious emotional stories without 
melodrama. You feel like you’re listening to ah upbeat song, while the 
lyrics are something else entirely. “Wrapped Up in Books" is a little ditty 
about fantasy relationships and the unwillingness to change course and 
follow your real desires.
Franz Ferdinand, “Cheating On You” As tired^es they sound now,
I have a fondness for Franz Ferdinand — the soundtrack to a lot of 
reckless driving senior year of- high school. It wasn’t “Take Me Out” 
which got me hooked; it was “Cheating On You,” a song by all accounts 
much less musically interesting. But there was something exhilarating 
about shouting "I’m cheating on you!” out car windows, as relationships 
became strained and the angst of high school came to a head.

Aftertaste
Tessaro’sA play about a handkerchief
Pitt performs Desdemona, an update of Shakespeare’s Othello
Some things never change. Luckily, the hamburger at 
Tessaro’s is one of them. The recipe has remained virtually 
the same since Kelly Harrington took over the restaurant in 
1984 with the help of his sister and mother. When you enter, 
it’s guaranteed that at least one Harrington will greet you.
Dark wood paneling surrounds the bar area at Tessaro’s, 
and the dining rooms have exposed brick walls, many 
covered in murals. Large black fans spin leisurely from the 
tin ceiling amid the dim lighting. Though the lighting is dark, 
the warmth of the crowd creates an inviting atmosphere. 
There’s often a wait; on Friday or Saturday nights especially, 
it is not atypical to see people three-deep at the bar.
Despite the crowded vibe, the service is personal and 
unhurried. The bartenders and wait staff wear white 
button-down shirts, black aprons, and neckties, adding a 
touch of old-fashioned class to a restaurant that already 
embodies gentility. This feeling is reinforced by the way they 
pull out tables for guests taking a seat in the bar area.-
Perhaps nothing exemplifies Tessaro’s appeal better than its 
clientele. On any given night, you are likely to see a cross 
section of Pittsburgh — distinguished-looking senior citizens, 
thritysomethings starting a night on the town, a single father 
with his children, nurses who just got off shift, and regulars 
from the neighborhood.
Most of them come to Tesarro’s for the burgers. Tessaro’s 
serves each half-pound burger on a hefty Kaiser bun, best 
ordered a juicy medium rare. The restaurant cooks its burgers 
on a large hardwood grill, bringing out thè beef’s richness 
and tenderness. Unlike other establishments, at Tessaro’s a 
medium rare is a medium rare, warm red center and all. Your 
meat will come as ordered, not overcooked.
Options range from the classic hamburger to a bacon 
blue cheese burger. The gourmet cheeseburger, with 
sautéed mushrooms, caramelized onions, and crisp bacon, 
is particularly delicious. The taste of the mushrooms is 
overwhelmed by th& beef, but the lasting sweetness of 
the onions and the saltiness of the bacon complement the 
burger perfectly. The flavorful meat can overpower some 
of the cheeses, especially the cheddar, which is lacking in 
sharpness. American cheese is always a safe bet, while blue 
cheese offers a more adventurous alternative.
Lacking from the side options are French fries, with home-fried 
potatoes serving as a somewhat unsatisfactory substitute. 
Instead, opt for the potato salad, sweet and creamy with a 
slight tang. Thick red potato skins and small pieces of celery 
round out the salad, giving it a nice crunch.
Tessaro’s also has a full bar. The beer selection is 
Pittsburgh-heavy, offering the likes of Penn Pilsner and Iron 
City. A pint of Sam Adams at $3.50 makes the wait to be 
séated more enjoyable.
As you leave, Harrington thanks you for your business, not 
because he needs to — Tessaro’s is a Bloomfield institution
- but because that’s the type of establishment he runs.

Showing .now at the University of Pittsburgh, Paula Vogel’s 
Desdemona: A Play About A Handkerchief gives a female 
perspective on Shakespeare's Othello. In the original story,
Iago is upset .that Othello promoted Cassio above him in the 
army. To seek revenge, Iago steals a handkerchief belonging 
to Desdemona, Othello’s wife, eventually planting it in the 
hands of Cassio — convincing Othello that Cassio has taken 
Desdemona as his-lover. Emilia, Iago's wife, tries to tell Othello 
the truth, but before she can get to him, Othello becomes 
overcome with jealousy and murders Desdemona. Iago then 
murders Emilia for attempting to foil his plan and Othello kills 
himself in shame. At the end of the play, Iago is taken away, 
presumably to be executed.
Vogel's Desdemona, a three-actor play, is a feminist revision of 
this story. Focusing on the interactions between Desdemona, 
Emilia, and Bianca (Cassio’s lover), Vogel creates a revision 
of the story in which even new personalities and decisions 
still end the women’s lives in tragedy. Trapped within a 
Shakespearian world, the women cannot sustain friendships 
with each other or be what men expect them to be. Vogel 
focuses on the small hopes each woman carries, as they 
struggle to survive in what can only end in tragedy.
In Desdemona, the characters’ personalities are introverted. 
Desdemona, unhappy and stuck in her marriage with Othello, 
becomes a. whore at night, sneaking out to experience the 
world through the "seeds’’ of many men. Emilia is a moral, 
faithful wife to Iago; although true to her marriage and the 
Catholic Church, she waits for the day her husband will die 
to use their savings. Bianca is a prostitute, the “new woman” 
Desdemona desperately wishes to become, but only wishes to 
be married to Cassio and bear his children.
The principal cast of the production gave a good performance. 
Bonnie Doyle played Desdemona for her first performance at 
the University of Pittsburgh. Doyle skillfully used her body and 
voice to create a playful and callow Desdemona. She was able 
- to project lines befitting of a senator’s daughter, while walking 
the strut of a sexually enlightened teenage girl.
4601 Liberty Ave., Bloomfield. 412.682.6809.
Meg Stiles (Bianca) was much more powerful on stage. Her 
long legs and gaudy actions never failed to elicit a proper 
laugh from the audience. She portrayed a naivete that 
overshadowed the character’s job as a prostitute so that 
Bianca’s tragic end came off as saddening.
But the most powerful actress was Joanna Getting, who 
brought her character Emilia to life more than any other 
actress. Even when other characters took the stage, Getting’s 
facial expressions were enough to maintain the audience’s 
attention. Her Irish-sounding dialect and hardy movements 
felt perfect for Emilia’s character.
To prepare for Desdemona, the actors went through a series of 
training in Viewpoints, a movement training method adapted 
from modern dance developed by Anne Bogart. Director Julie- 
Costa Malcolm trained both the principal and alternate casts, 
using different varieties of training for each.
"As a result [of various types of training], the principal cast 
connected more strongly with the text and the alternate cast 
connected more strongly with Viewpoints," said Malcolm, 
a doctoral student at Pitt. “And you can see that when you 
watch the two versions of the show."
“I feel like the production was a success because everyone 
involved had a powerful and important learning experience. 
I’m proud of the results,” she said. “And, as always, I’m 
impressed with the work the-students here at Pitt can 
produce."

No end in sight for writers strike
What’s happening with your favorite shows?
After falling to reach an agreement with the higher-ups 
in Hollywood, members of the Writers Guild of America 
(WGA) went on strike last Monday at midnight. The strike, 
between the WGA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and 
Television Producers (AMPTP), looks like it will continue for a, 
while, as the warring factions have yet to schedule any new 
negotiations, according to Variety. Hoping to avoid a similar 
battle, the Directors Guild of America (DGA), whose contract 
ends in June, has scheduled time with the AMPTP.
The WGA consists of writers for TV and movies as well as 
some multi-hyphenates (director-writers, writer-actors, etc.) 
who consider themselves to be primarily writers. Clashing 
with the AMPTP, the writers want to receive increased 
residuals, or payments per viewing, on DVD and DVR formats, 
as well as begin to receive compensation for Internet media.
One example of Internet media are the “webisodes” that some 
shows like The Office ran online during summer of 2006.
The actors and writers were not paid for their work on the 
"webisodes," considered promotional material, even though 
some of them were extremely successful; in June, the Office 
shorts won a Daytime Emmy for Best Broadband Comedy. 
NBC would not even pay for The Office's Emmy statuettes, 
wrote co-executive producer, writer, and actor (playing Toby) 
Paul Lieberstein.
Currently, writers receive 4 cents for every DVD of their work 
sold, and make no money from any "new” media, such as DVR 
playback or the Internet. The WGA wants to double the DVD 
residual to 8 cents, in addition to guaranteeing writers some 
payment for Internet media.
In the first week of the strike, many non-writers showed their 
support for the WGA. Actors on popular series including 
Heroes and Scrubs have been shown on the picket lines. 
Additionally, many showrunners, those who manage the daily 
work of a series and are often, but not always, producers, have 
refused to return to their shows until the strike is over. For 
example, Shonda Rimes, the creator and showrunner of Grey’s 
Anatomy, as well as a member of the WGA, does not plan on 
attending work until the strike ends, even though she can 
legally manage Grey's despite her WGA affiliation. And Office ¦ 
star Steve Carell has not come to set since the strike, telling 
the studio he came down with a case of "enlarged balls,” 
according to www.stevecareU.net.
M What does the strike mean for Carnegie Mellon viewers?
While there were rumors before the strike that studios had 
stockpiled scripts for television shows far in advance, this 
isn’t the case. While several shows have completed their runs 
(don’t worry Dexter fans, the finale is finished), most have not. 
Mid-season replacements like The New Adventures of Old
Christine and Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles have 
their entire runs already filmed, but most shows currently on 
television will go dark part way through the season.
24, which normally returns in January for its 24 episodes to 
run without breaks, will be postponed to prevent a long hiatus 
between episodes. The Office will air its final episode this 
Thursday, while Desperate Housewives will end its current 
season unintentionally on a cliff-hanger. Heroes, beginning to 
pick up from a second-season slump, reshot the ending of its 
11^ episode to act as a season finale in case the strike does 
not allow the show to resume within a few months. While 
such measures may seem rash, the last WGA strike in 1988 
lasted for 22 weeks.
Viewers should soon expect to see more reality programs on 
major networks, as reality television “writers,” responsible 
for creating story lines out of footage, are not members 
of the WGA. Among the slated reality shows are CBS 
summer-institution Big Brother, airing in its first winter 
edition, and juggernaut American Idol, which will return as 
scheduled in January.

about time for you to stop . 
and make some of those 
complicated, life-changing 
decisions about why on Earth 
you’re at Carnegie Mellon. 
Should you go into psych?
Or maybe bio? Bio-Psych? 
Psych-Bio?! Once your head 
has stopped spinning, and 
you’ve decided what you’re 
going to do every day for the 
next 45 or so years, don’t forget

Run Lola Run

Perhaps you’re one of those 
lazy people who don’t like 
watching foreign films. Or 
maybe you’ve got an awful 
fear of bright red hair. I don’t 
care: Watch Run Lola Run. It’s 
an awesome movie about the 
butterfly effect that shows what 
can happen if just one thing 
changes in a story. Actually, the 
story repeats three times.with 
three different results. With all 
of that, there’s enough running 
in this movie to make you 
breathless (well, you would run 
too if you had 20 minutes to find
100,000 German marks), and 
you can even learn how to curse 
in German. How could you pass 
that up?

It’s a fairy tale for everyone, if 
Harry Potter and Lord of the 
Rings haven’t filled your appetite. 
There’s so much going on in 
this movie — it seriously has 
everything: magic, pirates, 
unicorns, witches, wizards, falling 
stars, and Claire Danes. If that 
doesn’t draw the Dungeons & 
Dragons kids out, I don’t know 
what will (maybe Sunday’s Dollar 
Movie).
Hairspray

Need some inspiration for your 
paper on racism? Well, you can 
learn all about it through song, 
dance, and big hair. Hairspray 
(the remake) is one of the coolest 
musicals out there, with humor, 
fun, a cute message, and 
entertaining singing and dancing. 
Personally, I like the 1988 version 
of Hairspray more, and I’m pretty 
sure the Broadway musical is 
way better, but that doesn’t 
mean it’s a bad movie. And, this 
one’s got John Travolta in a fat 
suit as a woman — how can you 
resist?

come join the rest of Carnegie

where you can do exactly the same

Pittsburgh pipin
by Amanda Cole j St^lfwriter
pc,.,, **
With Carnegie Mellon offering a bagpipe performance 
major, students Wave many opportunities to hear bagpipes 
on campus. What many may not realize, however, is that 
Pittsburgh is full of other opportunities to attend piping 
performances. Last weekend, the 2C07 Balmoral Classic, 
a weekend-long event featuring a variety of piping 
^performances, was held in Pittsburgh. :
f?.,v ¦ 'On campus
Carnegie Mellon is a great place for young bagpipers, 
featuring a bagpipe performance major and a competitive 
pipe band open to majors and non-majors alike. World- 
renowned piper Alasdair Gillies leads the piping program 
at Carnegie Mellon. Gillies has taught at Carnegie Mellon 
since 1997, and holds studio courses in addition to directing 
the pipe band. The university now has two bagpipe majors, 
junior Nicholas Hudson and first-year Andrew Bova, both of 
whom have been playing for about seven years
“Carnegie Mellon has a great program and a world-class 
instructor, so it was an easy choice for me," Bova said.
“It’s not simply the degree, but the teacher," wrote Hudson 
in an e-mail. "Alasdair Gillies is one of the best players 
alive today. If there was a less qualified teacher, I probably 
wouldn't be here.”
In addition to the two majors in bagpipe performance, there 
are other non-majors who participate in the competitive pipe 
band. I wanted to keep playing in college, [and Carnegie 
Mellon] provided that opportunity," said James Dougherty, 
a junior history major in the pipe band. “Also, Alasdair is 
a legend in the piping community and the chance to work 
with him for four years [was] irresistible.”
Even with these motivations to pipe at Carnegie Mellon, 
some may wonder what attracts some students to the play 
the bagpipes in the first place.
nal Scottisi
"Bagpipes have a sound all their own, there's no other 
instrument quite like them," said Bova. "Also, the people 
involved are great and there is a rich culture and tradition 
involved as well.”
There are many reasons that people choose to play ce 
instruments, Hudson explained, but with bagpipes, th< 
decision is usually made before they have even played the 
instrument.

“I think it is a real testament to the quality of our band that 
we won a contest in the fall. The bands we play against are 
not college bands. They are bands that have their me 
in a fairly centralized location year-round,” Dougher 
“[They had] a big advantage in the fall when we only had 
two practices together before our first competition after not 
playing together for three months." Competitions benefit 
the band by encouraging practice and exposing the band to 
judges' feedback, Dougherty added.

"We have a great, pipe band here at CMU Competition is 
something that I live for," Bova said. "We are a really fun and 
easygoing group of friends, but when it comes time to march 
into the competition circle and play, we are all quite serious 
about what we do.”
: a great opportunity, but it is very time-consuming, 
time to practice, study, teach, and have

wrote Hudson. "What I value most are the

who I am privileged to call my friends."
The pipe band had a successful run in the most recent 
season, which ended about a month ago. The band won one 
of its spring competitions, as well as a chance to compete 
in the Mid-Atlantic Regional Championships this fall.
Unfortunately, the band was unable to rehearse together over
the summer, and the competition was held during move-in Even disregarding Carnegie Mellon's presence in Pittsburgh

advisory board and an instructor for the summer programs.

Did you know?
Nov. 13,1907
Nov. 26, 1957
A blurb describes the attire required 
of .first-years at various schools, from 
straw hats with crowns painted dark 
green at Bowdoin University, to brown 
skullcaps at Brown University, to red 
and white hats, sweater vests, neckties, 
and socks at Oberlin. And I thought 
those Orientation shirts were tacky.
Six students receive academic probation 
after stealing a thousand-pound bell 
from Slippery Rock Teacher’s College. 
The students rolled the bell off Slippery 
Rock’s campus, then drove it back to 
Carnegie Tech. They rang the bell in 
the parking lot of Morewood Gardens,- 
and repeated the scene in a parking lot 
in the fraternity quad, before they were 
apprehended by the administration.
Nov. 9, 1982
A Tartan writer complains about 
a change in the meal plan policy: 
First-years pledging fraternities are no 
longer allowed to drop their meal plans, 
and can now (like today) only switch to 
a reduced meal plan. It might be more 
expensive this way, but at least fraternity 
members have a hired chef. So, who’s 
really losing here: the fraternities, or the 
rest of Carnegie Mellon?
The Tartan calendar advertises an event 
called Download the Holy Spirit, for 
churchgoers who - so says the blurb
- "just can’t roll out of bed on a Sunday 
Nov. 10, 1997 morning.” The mass takes place at the 
UC Chapel. Sundays at 6 p.m., and, 
despite the name, there appears to 
be no downloading involved. As for 
uploading, it doesn’t say — hopefully, 
attendees can transfer their prayers at 
14 terabytes per second.
A front-page headline announces some 
truly earth-shattering news: “Architect 
curriculum stressful in early years.” 
Really? And I thought “Archie’s Leap” 
Nov. 11, 2002 was just for kicks.
Nov. 13, 2006
The Frame hosts perhaps its most 
buoyant exhibit to date: “TA-TAs,” a 
show dedicated to Mellons — I mean 
melons. “TA-TAs" featured a canopy of 
bras, breast examination posters, and 
jugs of Franzia with spouts that look 
like nipples. But the most entertaining 
part of “TA-TAs” was the interactive 
component: isitors (especially those 
female) were invited to go into the back 
room, remove their shirts, and create 
“breast prints” using paint and poster 
board.

Six out of 16 ain’t bad
Broken Social Scene hits Wiegand Gym
Broken Social Scene visited Carnegie Mellon Saturday night, 
dominating the annual fall concert presented by the Activities 
Board. With opener Arthur & Yu, the three-hour show 
entertained students and indie-lovers crowded around the 
stage in Wiegand Gymnasium.
Broken Social Scene, based in Toronto, is one of the most 
popular indie bands today, not to mention a veritable 
super-group of Canadian stars. While only six members 
appeared on stage at Carnegie Mellon, the active roster of 
Broken Social Scene members totals 16, according to the 
band’s website at www.aits-crafts.ca/bss. The band has only 
expanded since its formation in 1999, even though most of 
its members also work in other bands or have solo acts. Many 
often do not tour with the band, and popular names that 
haven’t recently appeared on the road include Leslie Feist, 
the darling of the current campaign for the redesigned iPod 
nano; Emily Haines, the frontwoman of Metric and a solo artist 
in her own right; and Andrew Whiteman, the creator of and 
showrunner behind Apostle of Hustle.
Two members of Broken Social Scene obviously on stage were 
founders Kevin Drew and Brendan Canning. Drew, a guitarist 
and sometime-keyboardist, and Canning, the primary bassist, 
are fixtures on any Broken Social Scene tour, as has been 
drummer Justin Peroff since 2002.
Seattle folk group Arthur & Yu did a fine job opening the show, 
even if it was obvious they could not hold the audience’s 
attention. From the wings of the stage, the volume from the 
band and the volume of conversations from the audience 
were equal. Band members Sonya Westcott and Grant Olsen 
harmonized beautifully, despite the acoustics of Wiegand 
Gym, which were problematic throughout the show. Songs like 
"Come to View” from Arthur & Yu’s debut album In Camera set 
up a nice opening for Broken Social Scene, the bands’ sounds 
contrasting to provide a nice dichotomy.
After a short break between acts, Broken Social Scene took the 
stage. From the moment its members entered from the back 
door of the gym and began to play “Lucky Ones,” the audience 
howled. The show continued for almost two hours, with many 
students from the University of Pittsburgh in the audience,
as noted by the band on stage. There was almost no dancing, 
though head:bobbing was in full force.
The band managed to play songs spanning most of its history, 
as well as new solo material from Drew. His recently released 
solo album, Spirit If..., is part of a planned series called Broken 
Social Scene Presents, showcasing the solo skills of many of the 
band’s individual musicians. The group performed songs like 
"Tbtf" and "Gang Bang Suicide" off Spirit E.., and there were 
free postcards of the album cover at the merchandising table, 
which also sold albums on CD and vinyl, as well as buttons, 
posters, and T-shirts.
One shirt not for sale was the official identifier of AB Tech, 
featuring an elaborate logo for the show with both Broken 
Social Scene and Arthur & Yu worked into the design. AB 
Tech set up most of the show and managed the technical 
aspects of the show. The cameras and screen used for image 
magnification of the band were managed by cmuTV.
The show looked like it was over when Drew ran off the stage, 
down the stairs to the right, and out of the gym through the 
back doors, while the rest of the band finished up the song and 
left after him. After a few moments, however, Drew eventually 
ran back inside and headed the encore to the show. Following 
the encore, which ended with the crowd singing along to 
the final song on the solo effort, "When It Begins,” the band 
members left the stage and continued toward the back door 
again, but this time stayed and signed posters and postcards 
for some AB and cmuTV members.
Drew told one of his managers, "I ran around outside back 
there, you know,” to which the manager replied: "I know you 
did." Maybe someone ran into Kevin Drew by the football field 
Saturday night and didn’t even know it. Or maybe, all anyone 
saw was a blur of black glitter sneakers. The show, like Drew, 
was a blur.
