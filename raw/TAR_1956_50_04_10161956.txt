Before and after the intermis­
sion exci jment the record crowd 
of 852 couples at the Homecoming

At the regular CFP meeting last 
Monday, the Rush Week evalua­
tion committee gave its report and 
recommendations for next year. In 
general the committee considered 
the new fraternity tour system 
successful, but several changes 
were proposed and advocated by 
the council.
These included holding all the 
tours in one evening, cutting the 
time in each house down to 15 
minutes to accommodate this, and 
probably scheduling each group to 
visit only nine houses so as to 
shorten the evening and minimize 
boredom. A more effective name- 
card system for the freshmen on 
the tours was also proposed.
Other suggested changes in Rush 
Week were to reduce non-rush 
hours following scheduled fresh­
man events from one hour to one- 
half hour, to end the stag parties 
at 1:00 a.m. instead of 2:00, to 
have the religious restrictions, if 
any, of each house stated at the 
fraternity orientation program, 
and to limit the charging hordes 
of luggage grabbers at Morewood 
to five men per fraternity. A mo­
tion to permit rushing of Fine 
Arts students in the dorms when 
tests are scheduled for E&S stu­
dents only was also passed.
In other business, the budget 
for the year was accepted, Dave 
Dull was elected as CFP repre­
sentative to the pledge presidents’ 
council, and President Plugge and 
Vice President Wilton were ap­
pointed delegates to the national 
inter-fraternity conference. It was 
announced that the Alumni Office 
is desirous of obtaining a list 
from each house of alumni re­
turning for Homecoming.

all present and new reporters

Homecoming 1956 opened on Friday afternoon, October 12, at 
1:30 with the Carnegie Day exercises held in the gymnasium. After
two introductory marches played by the Kiltie Symphonic Band,
Master of Ceremonies Richard Brown took charge of the program,
? welcoming the audience and in­
troducing the alumni address, 
which was given by the vice
president of the Alumni Associa­
tion. After the adress, calls to the 
honoraries and various awards 
were made, during which the 
Cameron Choir and the Kiltie
Symphonic Band entertained.
The high spot of the program 
was the crowning of the Home­
coming queen, Margaret Snod­
grass, by President Warner. The 
event was preceded by the coro­
nation processional, featuring the 
Kiltie Pipers and Scabbard and 
Blade; and afterwards Dick Oden. 
John Leonard, and Alan Gorelick 
entertained the court with a hum­
orous skit based on one of Con- 
fucious’ sayings and having po­
litical and student council over­
tones. At the conclusion of the 
program the Queen lifted her 
sceptre to proclaim the official 
opening of Homecoming.
The calls to the various hon­
oraries included: Pi Delta Epsilon: 
Ron Abrams, Tom Davies, Ann 
Forest, Suzie Groves, Alan Hodel, 
Ed Holsten, Harry Hoover, Betsy 
Kuhn, Walt McCormack, Kitti

“Curiosity killed the cat.”
Second place was won by the 
Tri Delts, for their efforts to 
prove that “Knowledge is power.” 
A Mortar Board chorus and a 
proverbial Grecian pillar helped 
dissuade a CIT football player 
from putting sports before stud­
ies.
In the swing of current events 
were the AEPhis, who took third 
place in the competition. A soph­
isticated, satin-draped chorus un­
der the title, ‘ The Peacock Party,” 
proved that it is women who 
persuade men, and thus Republi­
cans and Democrats.
Puritanically proper, the ChiOs 
performed the changes undergo­
ing a student from freshman 
through senior years. The student 
progressively became less puri­
tanical. What happens when a j 
little boy tires of the usual kiddy | 
type nursery rhymes was seen in 
the Delta Gamma skit. Naturally, 
he goes for cool, blind mice—Stan 
Kenton style—and an Italian type 
Little Red Riding Hood. The re­
turn of two alumni and their 
reminiscing over a “mud of brew” ' 
was cleverly portrayed in the 
KAT skit. Sigma Kappa elves ca­
vorted in a pixie kingdom of 
shoemakers.

Russian Comedy 
Will Be Presented 
By Drama Dept.
Again this year we look forward 
eagerly to the drama department’s 
first production. From October 24 
to November 1. “A Month in the 
Country”, a Russian comedy by 
Ivan Turgenev, will be presented 
at the Fine Arts Theater under 
the capable direction of Marv 
Morris. Among the many success­
ful plays she has directed is last 
year’s “Cocktail Party.” “A Month 
in the Country” is the first of six 
plays to be presented free of 
charge this year. Tickets will be 
available October 17 in Fine Arts.
The fifteen characters in the 
play will be under expert guid­
ance, since Mary Morris has re­
cently returned from New York 
where she participated in the play.
Three of the four major charac­
ters are “double-cast”, the two

contemporaries, it should prove 
not only a comedy, but a treat in 
character study.

Sideline Xews 
And Views
By Marjo King
; The Security Council of the U.N. 
recessed Friday with no final 
agreement reached between the 
Anglo-French interests and Egypt 
over the Suez Canal crisis, but 
definite progress was made.
Opening Friday, October 5, the 
debate faced the probability of a 
second rejection by Egypt of the 
London conference proposals in­
itiated by Secretary Dulles. How­
ever, Dulles* was able to win an 
Anglo-French agreement to con­
duct private negotiations with 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Mah- 
moud Fawzi which opened Tues­
day.
Participating in the top-secret 
meeting were Secretary General 
Dag Hammarskjöld, Fawzi, and 
Foreign Ministers Selwyn Lloyd 
of Britain and Christian Pineau of 
France. Britain let it be known 
that they were willing to consider 
a compromise similar to that pro­
posed by India’s Krishna Menon, 
but Fawzi remained evasive and 
cautious when questioned on 
Egypt’s attitude. *
Statement Made 
Friday afternoon the Security 
Council met in closed session to 
hear the result of the talks. Mr. 
Hammarskjöld read a six-princi­
ple statement which included free 
transit, respect of Egypt’s sov­
ereignty, and agreement among 
the users for tolls.
Britain and France objected that 
the statement did not include pro­
visions for sanctions, an interna­
tional board or mention of the 
London proposals, and invited 
Fgypt to further negotiations. 
They also stipulated that Egypt 
submit proposals for the actual 
operation of the canal “not less 
effective” than the London rec­
ommendations.
Eisenhower’s Visit 
Highlighting last week's Repub­
lican campaign was Mr. Eisen­
hower’s visit to Pittsburgh where 
he was very well received. He 
emphasized a record of “almost 
four years of solid accomplish­
ments,” and defended the “big 
business” charge by citing the
The following is a condensation 
of some of the more important 
planks of the Republican plat­
form, submitted by the Students 
for Eisenhower organization. The 
complete text may be found in 
the August 31, 1956 issue of U. S 
News & World Report, available 
in the Tech library.
At the present time the citizens 
of the United States are enjoying 
greater prosperity than at any 
time in its history. And it is a 
genuine prosperity, untainted by 
war or runaway inflation. The cost 
of living, which had risen nearly 
50% during the Truman years, 
rose less than 3% during the Eis­
enhower administration and was 
far outdistanced by the rise in 
workers Wciges. This has been ac­
complished along with the largest 
tax cut in American history and 
a balanced budget. The Republi­
can party promises further tax 
cuts, with special consideration 
for low and middle income groups, 
to whatever extent the require­
ments of balancing the budget 
permit.
Farm Problem
The Republican platform recog­
nizes the special needs of farmers, 
one sector of our economy Which 
is not enjoying the general pros­
perity. However, the solution does 
not lie in reviving rigid price 
supports which only serve to add 
to the mountains of price-depress- 
ing food surpluses. Instead it of­
fers flexible price supports and the 
“soil bank” plan.
In the realm of civil rights the 
Republicans have taken an une­
quivocal stand supporting the Su­
preme Court’s anti-segregation de­
cisions. They also point to the end 
of segregation in the armed serv­
ices, veterans hospitals, the Dis­
trict of Columbia schools and in 
all federal employment, all under 
Eisenhower.
The Republican platform prom­
ises revision of the Taft-Hartley 
Act to protect more effectively 
the rights of labor unions, as rec­
ommended by President Eisen­
hower in 1955 and 1956 and block­
ed each time by the Democrats in 
Congress. It does not suggest a 
further increase in the minimum 
wage at the present time but does 
recommend extension of its cover­
age to more workers. Such exten­
sion was blocked by the southern 
Democrats in the last Congress.
Finally the Republican platform 
promises continued operation of 
“a Federal government that is 
clean, honorable and increasingly 
efficient.”
present high employment and 
wages.
Stevenson charged the Presi­
dent of being unaware of real 
problems, at home or abroad, un- 
| able to control his own party in 
Congress and surrounded by rep­
resentatives of “the largest inter­
ests.” The issues of peace and aid 
for schools also served as Demo­
cratic targets.
Poll speculations indicated that 
Stevenson will gain more votes 
than he did in ’52, but victory 
would probably hinge on Demo­
cratic success in the urban states.

Hoivard Harpster, 
Football Great,
In Hall Of Fame
Cross Country 
Wins In Rout
Last Wednesday the Tech thin'
. On a cold and blustery day at 
Forbes Field in November of 1926 
a lanky 150 lb. quarterback “with 
the mind of a coach” received his 
first taste of pigskin glory as he 
directed Carnegie Tech to a stun­
ning upset of a then undefeated, 
Rose Bowl bound Notre Dame.
Last Saturday, that same lanky 
quarterback, Howard Harpster, 
All-American selection in 1928, 
formally acepted membership to 
the National Football Hall of 
Fame at the Tech-DIckinson grid 
game. The immortal Tech back, 
the greatest player in Tech history 
and whom m^ny call the greatest 
of any seen on any Pittsburgh 
team, was voted into the Hall of ! 
Fame last January along with j 
many other greats.
The man whom the immortal | 
Knute Rockne called “The Coach’4 
and “The 12th Man,” came to Tech 
in 1925 from Akron, Ohio where 
he had been a great high school 
player. Harp chose Tech because 
of its fine architectural courses— 
his father was one of the leading 
architects in Akron. In five years 
(architecture is a five year pro­
gram) at Tech he compiled an 
enviable record — not only in 
football but with a high academic 
track, and election to a number 
of honorary societies on the basis 
of leadership and character.
The foundation of Harp’s genius

over high ranking Notre Dame.
clads romped over the boys from 
West Virginia at the Schenley 
Park course. What was expected 
to be a tough meet turned into a 
rout with the Tartans winffing 
scores 39-19.
First, as might be expected, was 
Tech’s Eric Ottervik with a win­
ning time of 23 minutes and 59 
seconds. Ottervik’c time was only 
. 46 seconds off the record set by 
I Coach Carman several years ago.
] Ottervik’s time looks even better 
after noting that he slowed down 
at the top of the last hill to wait 
for Bryant and Olds who came in 
second and third.
Following Bryant and Olds were 
two West Virginia runners. Sid 
Vinall came ni fourth and Barry 
Edwards was fifth. Zeno Fritz and 
Len Elikan came ni sixth and 
seventh for Tech to complete the 
rout. This Wednesday the thin- 
clads take on Case at the Schenley 
Park course.
I. M. Football
By George Paris
IM Football has gotten into full 
swing as league favorites have 
again come through with crushing 
victories. Only one or two teams 
in each league appear to have a 
chance to gain their championship.
The Skibo League looks like a 
race to the wire between the 
shifty Delts and a hard-running 
DU team. The Delts had no 
trouble with a completely out­
classed Sigma N u “N” team. 
Laugherty, passing with ease, led 
his team to an easy 36-6 victory. 
Meanwhile the DUs, quarterback­
ed by Roger Bell, downed the Met. 
Grads.
The Phi Kaps continued their 
dominance of the Tartan League 
b downing ATO “B” 32-12. Hviz- 
dos’ sharp passing and Visconti’s 
touchdown runs again led to the 
victory. Quparterback Tom Schorr 
led his Sigma Nu “S” chargers 
to victory over the Static Charges 
in a fast moving contest.
In Kiltie League activity, the 
ATOs threw up an impregnable 
defense to score their second shut­
out of the season, 18-0 over the 
PiKAs. Del Ritchie and Frank 
Smith did the bulk of the offen­
sive work as they passed and car­
ried for several large gains. Kap­
pa Sigma crushed an outclassed 
DU “B” team, 51-0. Don Casey 
scored an unprecedented seven 
touchdowns in leading the mas­
sacre.

downs. Dickinson, unable to ad­
vance, punted to Briner who re­
turned to the mid-field marker. 
Now the Tartan machine went 
into operation. Short gains by the 
entire backfield of from one to 
ten yards along with an eight 
yard pass from Tucci to Briner 
took the ball to the ten. Jesse 
Quatse took the ball over for 
Tech’s first score. The extra point 
attempt was unsuccessful. Bob 
Hammer kicked off but the Red 
Dwils again were unable to gain 
any ground. McElhinny took the 
Dickinson punt and returned it to 
the 50. Tucci passed to Cassett 
for 14 yards, but a short plunge 
and two incomplete passes forced 
Tech to punt; Tucci punted to 
three as the quarter ended.
The second quarter was much 
the same as the first with Tech in 
complete control. The second 
team, forcing Dickinson to punt, 
c^ried the ball to about the 20, 
Zffmi doing the bulk of the work. 
In went the first team and away 
went Briner for the score. The

point was missed. Hammer kicked 
off and Dickinson made their 
first down on a fake punt; how­
ever, their good fortune didn’t 
last and Tech took over on an 
intercepted pass. Tucci, taking to 
the air, hit McElhinney and Zinni 
and with 20 seconds left in the 
half, ended it up with a 25 yard 
TD heave to Jeep Myers.

Tommy Briner took the Dickin­
son second half kick for 20 yds. 
Quatse carried for 8 and McEl­
hinny for 10. Frank Zinni coming 
in to replace Briner took the ball 
around end for 23 yards. Two 
short gains carried the ball to the 
six where Zinni went over for 
the T.D. Ficery’s attempt was 
blocked. Later in the quarter, 
forced to punt, Tech’s second 
quarterback kicked one 50 yards 
in the air into the Dickinson end 
zone. Near the end of the quarter, 
Zinni intercepted a Red-Devil 
I pass and carried it 35 yards.
Myers took the ball for 12 but 
Tech fumbled and Dickinson re­
covered. Tech’s last score came in 
the fourth quarter when Cassett 
recovered a fumble deep in Dick­
inson territory. Majeski carried 
for five yards and then once more 
for 10 and the TD.
New Thistle Goes 
To George Hages
A wave of upsets ruined the 
selections of most of the ‘ 
in last week’s contest. Two games 
which no one picked correctly 
were Purdue’s upset of 
Notre Dame and the scoreless 
between Minnesota and North­
western. The men who tied for 
first place were George Hages and 
Duane Feisel, who was a previous 
winner. Hages, a sophomore living 
in McGill Hall, picked the socres 
more nearly right, and gets a 1957 
Thistle for his efforts.
