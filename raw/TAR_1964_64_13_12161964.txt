Dr. Stever Grants Interview 
To 2 Student Publications
Hour-Long Session Held Thursday 
In Dr. Warner’s Office: 9 Attend
*>by Sue Attinson
According to Dr. Horton Guyford Stever, president-elect 
of Carnegie Tech, the only thing one has to spend as a student 
is time. ?
Dr. Stever spent an hour of his 
time at a special interview last 
Thursday informing members of 
two campus publications, the 
Tartan and WRCT, about his 
preliminary visits to Carnegie 
Tech and his thoughts on edu- 
% cation.
President John C. Warner and 
Regis J. Ebner, Head of the News 
Service in theDepartment of Pub­
lic Relation, were present at the 
interview last Thursday. The 
Tartan representatives were Nan­
cy Cameron, Editor-inChief; Evan 
Melhado, Desk Editor; Sue Attin­
son, News Editor; and Dale Cho­
dorow, Editorial Advisor. Dave 
Kearns, News Director and Joe 
^ Hupcey, Program Manager, rep­
resented WRCT.
When questioned about the pur­
pose of last week’s five-day visit 
to the Carnegie Tech campus, Dr. 
Stever merely said it was “edu­
cation.”
He cited plans for a “more 
painful” trip in mid-January 
when the school's budget will be 
discussed. At that time he will 
also attend a banquet sponsored 
® by the Carnegie Board of Trus­
tees in honor of President War­
ner, and will meet the presidents 
of other colleges and universities 
in the Pittsburgh area.
In discussing research and the 
university, Dr. Stever explained 
that the creative process is use­
ful in every field. The broadened 
concept of research, related to 
this creative process has a cen- 
-I tral place in education.” He em- 
^ phasized, however, that he con­
cept of research prevalent in the 
basic sciences, is not the central 
theme in engineering and many 
many other fields.
Dr. Stever commented on re­
search done by the faculty. He 
said, “Some of the best teaching

Frosh Week
by Marcy Stern
Gail Whitacre, sophomore 
English major, was selected 
chairman of the 1965 Fresh­
man Orientation Week Com­
mittee last Thursday by the 
Executive Council of Student 
Congress.
Miss Whitacre was a 1964 
Freshman Camp counselor and is 
president of Cwens.
As director of next fall’s ori­
entation week activities, she 
hopes to head a creative effort 
which will result in a week of 
great value to freshmen. “Tra­
dition exists to be broken,” she 
states, “if someone comes up with 
an exciting idea.”
Miss Whitacre will choose her 
staff members before the semes­
ter break and encourages any­
one interested to contact her at

Review Of Speech
Emphasis
by Dale Chodorow
For those students who feel 
that the administration of Car­
negie Tech is very much detached 
from the student realm, Dr. War­
ner’s final speech presented them 
with a note of hope.
Outlining four major problems, 
Dr. Warner felt each deserved 
careful attention by the new ad­
ministration under Dr. Stever.
In the first place, Dr. Warner 
recognizes that the school has in­
creased the drudgery of learning 
without significantly adding to 
the excitement of learning. The 
curricular demands upon students 
have increased without the school 
having found changes in what 
and how subjects are taught.
Secondly, the unusual diversity 
of the campus must be made to 
serve as an intellectual advan­
tage for the students. As Dr. War­
ner puts it, “the interests of our 
students and many of our faculty 
are circumscribed too narrowly 
by their professional concerns.”
Third, Dr. Warner admitted 
that the administration and fac­
ulty “have not worked very as­
siduously at trying to understand 
the attitudes, values, and expec­
tations of students,” as well as 
not “fully and frankly” explain­
ing their own. Most important of 
all the problems, this statement
Changed To Students
imp’ies not just a problem to be 
solved, but an obtacle that must 
be removed.
Finally, Dr. Warner felt that 
more thought must be given to 
the recreational opportunities on 
campus. He cited Skibo Hall as 
a step toward achieving this.
Before outlining these problems 
to the students, Dr. Warner had 
said:
“I think I understand your 
point of view even though I do 
not share it. You are at Car­
negie Tech today, not yesterday 
or tomorrow. What Tech was 
ten years ago is an interesting 
bit of history, what it will be 
ten years hence is an interest­
ing bit of speculation. But neither 
the look back nor the look ahead 
changes the present, and the 
present is what you are par­
ticularly concerned about.”
The talk, in spots, captured a 
sympathy for student problems 
not often expressed by the ad­
ministration in the past. At the 
conclusion, following a brief 
statement by Joe Sandulli, Chair­
man of Student Congress, the 
students gave Dr. Warner a stand­
ing ovation.
The ovation was brief, begin­
ning in hesitance, and it was 
somewhat less sincere than it 
should have been. Perhaps this 
was the fault of the content of
Dr. Warner’s text, which was for 
the most part typical of a fi­
nancial report.
Despite a certain coldness, the 
facts represented what tremen­
dous strides Carnegie Tech has 
taken under Dr. Warner’s lead­
ership. He explained these strides 
more warmly when he said:
“In looking back over the past 
15 years, a few things seem clear. 
There have been noticable changes 
in Carnegie Tech. and on balance 
the change has surely been in 
the right direction. The under­
graduate program has remained 
strong; graduate studies have ex­
panded significantly and improved 
in quality; both the quantity and 
significance of research at Tech 
have increased; the facilities both 
for student living and for aca­
demic operations have been 
markedly improved, and the fi­
nancial base is sounder than 
ever.”
Dr. Warner continued by say­
ing. “our average faculty salary 
has increased 2.2 times.” Setting 
this apart from the rest. Dr. War­
ner seems to be most proud of 
this accomplishment.
All told, the accomplishments 
that Dr. Warner outlined need 
not have been, especially by him. 
They are as real as the influence 
he had in bringing them to frui 
tion.
The idea for study use of the 
cafeteria was presented by the 
Tartan staff last Wednesday to 
Harry Helm, manager of Food 
Service. Suggesting that the Tar­
tan take it through “proper chan­
nels,” he approved the plans and 
had it cleared through Dr. Dale 
Strick, co-ordinator of student 
activities.
A similar study program during 
exam periods has been used at the 
University of Pittsburgh for sev­
eral years, and the Pitt News re­
ports that it has worked quite 
successfully.
The only entrance which will 
be open 10 the cafeteria will be 
through tne Skibo lobby. Ino food 
will be served in the cafeteria, but 
students may purchase food in the 
snack bar. Snack bar hours will 
remain unchanged.
The library committee of Stu­
dent Congress is presently waiting 
for a decision from Edward 
achatz, vice-president for aca­
demic affairs, regarding exam 
week hours in the Hunt Library. 
Tueir proposal calls for the li­
brary to remain open during exam 
week until midnight. A decision 
is expected before Friday.
Dean Brown told the Tartan
that the plans would not have 
been approved had they been sug­
gested on a permanent basis. He 
felt that they would conflict with 
plans to extend library hours.
The Tartan will publish a com- 
! plete list of hours for campus 
I buildings in the January 13 issue.
MERRY CHRISTMAS k HAPPY MW YEAR

Dr. Stever Grants Interview 
To 2 Student Publications
(Continued from Page 1)
is done by some of the best re­
searchers.”
The president-elect outlined his 
I- feelings about the significance of 
extra-curricular activities. 
He feels that publication media 
are among the more rewarding 
of extra-curricular activities.
He referred to the influence of 
the MIT student newspaper over 
that school’s student body. An an­
nouncement about the Carnegie 
Tech presidency appeared in Bos­
ton papers. Dr. Stever’s students 
showed no awareness of the an­
nouncement until the following 
day, when the student publica­
tion was distributed.
He advised the campus publica­
tions to make them interesting 
and to serve their community.
In defining his attitude on ath­
letics, Dr. Stever said, “intra- 
f1 murals are fun because of their 
spontaneity; inter-collegiate sports 
are fun, too, because there is a 
Little bit of polish about them.” 
He feels that a balance between 
the two is important.
Describing his feelings about 
the ideal college curriculum, Dr. 
Steves said, “the educational pro­
cess is not complete unless part 
of it is broad and part of it is 
_ sufficiently narrow.” He claimed 
- that those who study subjects in 
depth are most employable im­
mediately while those who study 
in breadth have more employ­
ment potential for the future.
In answer to a question relat­
ing to last week’s Tartan edi­
torial on “peripheral vision,” Dr. 
Stever said, “when one is trying 
to get a feeling for a different 
field there has to be an inter­
change.” Extra-curricular activi­
ties, with their intermingling, 
help to accomplish this.
Dr. Stever discussed academic 
freedom. “Everyone — except the 
college president — has freeaom 
to speak as an individual . . . but 
freedom always implies respon­
sibility.”
In justifying his acceptance of 
the presidency of Carnegie Tech, 
Dr. Stever said, “It’s a fascinat­
ing place ... I believe strongly 
in the liberal-professional educa­
tion Tech gives.”
He expressed a strong liking 
for the university atmosphere and 
widely diverging educations found 
at Tech. “I like to see interaction 
at the student level.”
He claimed that Carnegie Tech 
has “an excellent past and a very 
bright future.”
As for his own future, Dr. 
Stever will assume the presidency 
of Carnegie Tech on February 1. 
He and his family will live close 
to campus, and according to Dr. 
Stever, “Close enough to hear 
but not to be seen.”
WRCT will broadcast the 
complete taped interview, to­
night at 10:30 p.m.

Fare 4 — CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN — Wednesday, December 16, 1»€4

What Red Tape?
Had Dean Brown not been in conference late Friday 
afternoon, the idea of opening the cafeteria for study pur­
poses could have been introduced and OK’d within three 
days. As it was, it only took the Tartan from Wednesday to 
Monday to conceive the idea and to have it approved.
We think that’s pretty good, and there are several people 
who deserve not only our thanks, but the thanks of every­
one who will benefit from the added study facilities.
Mr. Helm, manager of Skibo Food Service, was very re­
sponsive to the idea, and in fact, assisted the Tartan in having 
it approved through Dr. Strick’s office.
Mrs. Harriet Thorpe, resident head of women’s housing, 
and Mrs. Virginia Milligan, were most understanding toward 
the idea, and approved the extension of Morewood curfews 
even before the proposal had been approved.
Dr. Strick, co-ordinator of student activities, not only ac­
cepted the idea, but said that he would recommend to Dean 
Brown that it be passed.
And Dean Brown, dean of the Division of Student 
Affiairs, who gave final approval to the Tartan’s proposal.
Book Crooks
From one student to another, lifting, anonymously bor­
rowing, or stealing books from the library is probably one 
of the most inconsiderate and inexcusable things that one can 
do.
One student was recently asked to leave Carnegie Tech 
when no less than twenty books were found in the possession, 
books that still had bookcards, unsigned, in the front covers. 
These books had been taken, not only from stack shelves, 
but also from the reserve room. This leads up to the belief 
that the books which were stolen were needed by some other 
students for immediate use.
Books are purchased by and for the library for the 
express purpose of enabling students to delve into any realm 
of knowledge, to refer to any source of material they need.
The entire purpose of a library on a college campus is 
defeated when one student finds his needs more important 
than the academic needs of his colleagues and so takes books 
from the library.
The administration is to be commended for their treat­
ment of this student. His act was one which had been em­
phatically prohibited and which was definitely inconsider­
ate.
There is a responsibility for each student to respect the 
facilities of the college; the student who cannot follow #the 
basic rules of the campus must be disciplined.
Vacation?
As each Thanksgiving vacation rolls around, students are 
just about in the right mood to enjoy it, having worked some 
three months into the term. Unfortunately, the mood is not 
the same at Christmas, for most students must then look 
forward only to preparing term reports and studying for 
final examinations.
Immediately one thinks of the school calendar (which 
has been a topic for study here at the Tartan for several 
months). The real question, however, is this:
Does the burden of work placed upon students prior to 
Christmas, or for that matter throughout the school year, 
leave room for the personal pursuit of knowledge?
The following letter, which was recently received by the 
editors of the school newspaper at Harvard University, brings 
up a worthy point of observation:
College A Sweat 
To the Editors of the Crimson:
Could someone please tell me why college has to be such 
a sweat?
I don’t intend to criticize Harvard; as long as college 
is hard work, it stands to reason that Harvard must be hard­
er work than other colleges. What I want to know is, what 
is the reasoning behind a system that loads one with such a 
frightening amount of work that one rarely has time to do 
more than just the required amount of work in a subject? 
What is the sense in my roommate having seven papers to 
do this week when he is so pressed that he won’t learn any­
thing from doing them? Is there any sense in my staying up 
until 4 every night when I am so tired and sick of every­
thing that I can’t absorb what I am doing or learn by 
doing it?
If the object of college is the cultivation of the intellect 
and the pursuit of knowledge, why can’t I cultivate and 
pursue without the guilty thought of the report I should be 
writing? Why does the American system of college education 
spread so thin?
I wish someone would tell me the answers to these 
questions. I don’t have time to figure them out— I have to 
go do my Latin. But it would be so much easier to stay awake 
if I felt I were ruining my health for some rational reason.

Scranton Holds 
Press Parley 
For Colleges
Tech Represented 
By Tartan Editor
Governor William W. Scranton 
recently held a College Press Con­
ference in Harrisburg.
Approximately 200 students 
were present from 50 schools. 
Nancy Cameron, the Tartan Edi- 
tor-in-Chief, represented Carnegie 
Tech. The conference, an hour 
long question and answer session, 
was held in the House Caucus 
Room of the Capitol Building.
Since the students were given 
no restrictions on the type of their 
questions, they ranged from the 
57c sales tax on textbooks, to 
whether Governor Scranton plans 
to run for president in 1968, to 
what he thinks about supplanting 
the Goldwaterites in the Republi­
can Party.
Answering a question concern­
ing Temple University, Scranton 
commented that the result of 
Temple’s bid to become a state- 
related school should be known 
before the end of 1965. The matter 
is now before the State Board of 
Education, but he is agreeable to 
the prospect.
Governor Scranton favors sub­
sidizing the student rather than 
the school. This means a further­
ance of the National Defense Edu­
cation Act, which subsidizes stu­
dents.
Several colleges, including the 
University of Pittsburgh, have 
been protesting the 5% sales tax 
or. textbooks. Scranton said he 
was sympathetic to the idea of re­
moving this tax but that they had 
run into legal problems with a 
similar case in a Philadelphia 
book store. In order to repeal'the 
tax, a revision to the Constitution 
is needed. Broadening his state­
ment, Scranton declared that the 
greatest governmental need in 
Pennsylvania is Constitutional re­
vision.
When Governor Scranton was 
asked if he intended to run for 
president in 1968, he answered 
that he hadn’t thought of it, that it 
is more important at the moment 
to think of 1965-66.
Commening on the GOP, the 
governor stated that he is opposed 
to any leader (party chairman) 
who is not interested in including 
all segments of the party. He does 
not approve of what he terms “ex- 
clusivary” policy. It is important, 
he feels, to have a strong party 
feeling in both philosophy and or­
ganization. It is essential to enter 
first in the local level in all ele­
ments involved, then to move 
further into state, then national 
affairs.
Although the GOP was defeated 
in the last election, Governor 
Scranton is optimistic about the 
future. He claims this optimism 
even though, as he stated, he is 
not clairvoyant and can not see 
into the future, nor is he Drew 
Person and can predict it.
Governor Scranton was asked 
about the Milk Control Commis­
sion and, more specifically, about 
the possibility of the removal of 
one of the members who is taking 
a propaganda march in Philadel­
phia. He declared that a varied 
group is important to study this 
problem and that he did not feel 
this was sufficient reason to ask 
for her removal. However, he felt 
he would not personally have used 
the method of the march to ac­
complish this goal. Herbert A. 
Simon, Associate Dean of GS1A, 
is head of the Milk Control Com­
mission.

YMCA Initiates 
Freshmen Council
Editor, the Tartan:
I would like to bring to your 
attention a new organization 
which is becoming active on the 
Tech campus. The YMCA Fresh­
men Council, recently organized 
by the local Y, is composed of 
freshmen who were chosen for 
the qualities of leadership they 
showed during high school.
The group, which is represen­
tative of the freshman class, found 
that, while freshmen have a 
number of unique problems, there 
has never been an organization to 
deal specifically with the prob­
lems of freshmen. In an effort 
to alleviate this condition, the
council intends to discuss ways 
of helping freshmen adjust to 
college life in both the academic 
and school fields.
At one of the more • recent 
meetings, the council entertained 
George Tipker, head of men’s 
housing, and A1 Pollock, Dorm 
Council President, as informal 
speaker. Mr. Pollock explained 
the function of the Dorm Coun­
cil and answered questions which 
were raised by the group. Tipker 
also answered questions raised 
about the dorm system.
The Freshman Council is con­
cerned with any problem that a 
freshman may have, and I am 
sure that it will appreciate any 
opinions or comments. Sugges­
tions should be sent to the YMCA 
office in Skibo.

Although these provide you with 
some insight into the crosses a

I was forced to reject them as too 
frivolous for this occasion, and 
settle for the rather prosaic title 
listed on the bulletin boards.
One of the basic differences be­
tween students, faculty, and the 
administration can be demon­
strated by their respective out­
looks on the academic life span 
of a student generation. To you, 
„ the four undergraduate years 
—>seem like eternity, and I am sure 
that there are some who, before 
the first term it well under way, 
begin to count the days until 
graduation. To the administration 
the four years a student spends 
here seem unbelievably short, 
probably because each new gen­
eration of students wants to re­
open discussions on policies and 
regulations that were just agreed 
upon with the last generation of 
Ipitudents. The faculty, for obvious 
reasons, takes a position between 
these two extremes. Some of their 
students are gone much too soon, 
while they wonder if others will 
ever leave.
School’s History
Carnegie Tech was founded in 
1900 and opened its doors to stu­
dents in 1905, almost 60 years ago.
of you will graduate and move 
into the large company of Carne­
gie Tech alumni.
As alumni, your point of view 
will change. Those of you who 
retain an interest in Carnegie, and 
I hope it will be a large majority, 
shall remember Tech as you knew 
it, but become increasingly con­
cerned about what it is in the 
future and the direction it seems 
to be taking. As your alma ma­
ter becomes more distinguished, 
nationally and internationally, 
your Carnegie Tech label becomes 
more valuable to you.
A second value in looking 
backward is the leson it teaches 
about institutional change—that 
it is slow, almost imperceptible 
over short periods of time, but 
very real. It also indicates for 
us direction of change.
Finally, a view of what has 
happened over a decade and a 
half will show us not only what 
has been accomplished but what 
remains to be done. I suspect it 
shall also show us how the solu­
tion to some problems created 
new ones for which solutions still 
must be found.
When I assumed the presi­
dency of Carnegie Tech in 1950, 
the wave of veterans had subsided 
and the institution was returning 
to normal operation. It was quite 
a different place from the one I 
had come to originally as a chem­
istry instructor 24 years earlier. 
It had not changed much in size

velopment of graduate studies and date-ness to my teaching. And re­

classes, areas of importance in

I would like to begin this dis­
cussion with a confession that 
by failing to explain to you fully 
what we have been trying to do, 
we have probably aided and 
abetted a feeling of many stu­
dents that Carnegie Tech is

is in the undergraduate pro­
gram.
which the understanding of natur­
al phenomena was lacking, gave 
n®e some of my most important 
ideas for research.
Needed Physical Facilities
Let me turn now to the second 
problem; the physical facilities 
needed for the program already 
developed and being developed. 
The problem had two prongs:

the undergraduate operation. By 
1950 he had brought that aspect of 
education at Carnegie to a posi­
tion of leadership in the academic 
world. In comparison, our grad­
uate and research programs were 
relatively weak.
What now appears to be an 
emphasis on graduate studies 
and research has really been an 
effort to bring them to a posi­
tion in the academic world that 
is comparable to that enjoyed 
by the undergraduate program.
A few figures may serve to 
demonstrate this point.
In 1950 about one student in 
eight at Carnegie Tech was a 
graduate student. Last year the 
comparable figure was one in five. 
Even if we reach our stated goal 
by 1972, only one-quarter of the 
total enrollment will be graduate 
students. The rate of increase in 
graduate students is clearly great­
er than that of undergraduates, 
but this reflects not so much a 
great emphasis upon graduate 
study as the distance we had to 
come.
You will find, I think, that at 
California Institute of Technology 
and MIT, at Harvard, Yale, and 
Chicago, and at Stanford and Col­
umbia, all of which have first- 
class undergraduate programs, the
Gardens, which had been pur­
chased in 1946, and most of the 
men in the five older dormitories 
on Margaret Morrison Street. At 
that time slightly more than half 
of our students lived in Allegheny 
County, within commuting dis­
tance of Tech.
During the past 14 years this 
picture has been changing rapidly 
until today, only one student in 
four lives within commuting dis­
tance of the campus. To meet the 
housing needs of students, we 
have increased our capacity by 
150% over 1950 at a cost of just 
over $6.5 million.
The Campus Activities Center 
was completed in 1961 as well as 
Tech Field and the intramural 
area, bringing the total expended 
on facilities for student living and 
campus life to just under $11 mil­
lion.
On the academic side, the E 
unit of Doherty Hall (Engineering 
and Science Hall) was opened in 
the fall of 1950, my first year as 
president, and the GSIA building 
was opened in the fall of 1952. 
Following success in our Devel­
opment Program, the construction

ated a desperately needed study

ent just because you know things 
were worse in the past, anymore 
than your fathers should believe 
that the knowledge that they 
walked five miles to school should 
diminish your appetite for a Mus­
tang of your own.
I think I understand your point 
of view even though I do not 
share it. You are at Carnegie Tech 
today, not yesterday or tomor­
row. What Tech was ten years 
ago is an interesting bit of his­
tory, what it will be ten years 
hence is an interesting bit of 
speculation; but neither the look 
back nor the look ahead changes
everything he wished to do, but 
he had done a great deal. By re­
volutionizing the undergraduate 
program, firmly establishing the 
importance of humanities and so­
cial sciences in the education of 
professional men and women, and 
by placing a proper emphasis upon 
quality, Doherty had moved Car­
negie Tech into the forefront as 
an undergraduate institution in 
the professional fields represented 
here.
Emphasis On Graduate Studies
This, however, was only one 
phase of the over-all plan to de­
velop Carnegie Tech into a lead­
ing center of learning. Equally im­
portant was a program of graduate 
studies and research of a stature 
equal to that already attained at 
the undergraduate level. Although 
a modest beginning had been 
made in these areas, much re­
mained to be done. Moreover, new 
and improved facilities for both 
the educational programs and for 
student life on the campus were 
badly needed, and continuing fi­
nancial support at a higher level 
needed to be obtained to under­
gird the entire enterprise. These 
were the central problms of my

students. We are not attempting the addidon to Margaret Morrison 
to play the numbers game with Carnegie College, all completed
large state universities. Rather, 
our aim is to make a significant 
impact by turning out a reasonable 
number of graduates who are ex­
ceptionally well trained and crea­
tive.
It has been the view of the 
academic officers of Carnegie Tech,
since ol'ai produced another ,aiy 
000 square feet to be used in im­
proving and expanding educa­
tional activities. These projects, 
plus $1.8 million in educational 
equipment totaled just under $10 
million. All together they pro­
vided some 200,000 square feet of

— (a view in which I concur) 
that participation by faculty in 
Carnegie Tech as a center of 
learning through research and 
other scholarly-creative work 
makes our undergraduate educa­
tion more vital, more up to date, 
and more useful as the beginning 
of a whole lifetime of self-edu- 
cation.

never participated in professional

Creativity Is Hallmark
Important as they are to the 
educational program, the measure 
of a college or university is not 
to be found in its building pro­
gram. Able, conscientious, well 
motivated students interacting 
with bright, creative, and dedicat­
ed teachers are the heart and soul 
of a university. Recruiting and 
retaining a first-rate faculty has 
always been the most important 
administrative responsibility. Dur­
ing the past decade this task has 
been complicated by the tremen­

In my own career as a teacher I that a good deal more money 
and research scientist, there was a j would be required if Carnegie 
very important relationship be- j Tech was to continue its progress 
tween my accomplishments and | in the years ahead. But 1954 plans 
effectiveness in these two areas, were being made for the ten year
Development Program that began 
in 1957.
The nearly $30 million to be 
raised was to be used partly for 
the educational program in the 
form of tndowment or gifts for 
current operations. The success 
of the Development Program is 
already assured.
The most significant achieve­
ments in securing support for the 
educational program was a $5 
million endowment grant from the 
A. W, Mellon Trust to enhance our 
Fine Arts program, and $7 mil­
lion from industry and from sev­
eral foundations to support th* 
budget in Engineering and Science 
over a ten-year period.
Even more important, however, 
\ as the clear-cut evidence that 
scores of foundations, hundreds of 
industries, and thousands of in­
dividuals throughout the nation 
were convinced that Carnegie 
Tech merited their support. The 
suecas of the Development Pro­
gram was in a very real sense a 
vote of confidence in past per­
formance and a vote of trust on 
furure achievement. During this 
same development period, approx­
imately $40 million more has come 
to Carnegie in gifts and grants for 
useful purposes outside the goals 
of the Development Program.
In looking back over the past 
fifteen years, a few things seem 
clear. There have been noticeable 
changes in Carnegie Tech. and on 
balance the change has surely 
been in the right direction. The 
undergraduate program has re­
mained strong; graduate students 
have expanded significantly and 
improved in quality; both the 
quantity and significance of re­
search at Tech has increased; the 
facilities both for student living 
and for academic operations have 
been markedly improved, and the 
financial base is sounder than ever. 
During my administration the 
value of the physical plant has 
doubled; taking our investments 
at market value, our endowment 
has doubled and our average fac­
ulty salary has increased 2.2 
times. Carnegie’s total assets are 
now approximately $120 million.
I would be a hypocrite to deny 
that these achievements have been 
a source of real satisfaction to me. 
It would be equally foolish for me 
to leave you with the impression 
that Carnegie Tech’s problems are 
solved and that the past fifteen 
years have been only a parade of 
successes, unmixed with failures. 
The problems I pass on to my suc­
cessor are different from those I 
inherited, but they are equally 
real. Let me enumerate just a few 
that are of particular pertinence 
to you as students and potential alumni.
Drudgery Increased
(1) The average real ability and 
the academic preparation of those 
entering Carnegie Tech today is 
significantly superior to those who 
came here fifteen years ago. Both 
; the administration and faculty 
j have been slow in recognizing the 
¦ implications of this fact for the 
curriculum and for teaching 
methods. We have, I believe, taken 
| the easy way out of merely in- 
I creasing our demands upon stu- 
; dents without changing signifi- 
j cantly what we teach or how we 
| teach it #
The result has been to in­
crease the drudgery of learning 
without adding appreciably to 
the excitement of learning.
j (2) We have not yet found a 
way to use the unusual diversity 
! of our campus to the intellectual 
advantage of our students.
The interests of our students 
and many of our faculty are cir­
cumscribed too narrowly by 
their professional concerns.
As a consequence, too many 
students lose a rare opportunity 
i to broaden their intellectual hori­
zons and to understand more fully 
I the world in which they must live 
| and work.
(3) The problems of com un tea- 
5 tion are never easy to solve in a

Calendar Committee Revises 
Plans For Student Survey
Sample Proposals To Be Sent 
To 100 Pre-Selected Students
by Carol S. Guber
The Student Calendar Committee has modified the con­
tent and distribution plans for its student calendar survey.
Last week’s Tartan reported' 
that all freshmen, all sophomores 
and a group of randomly selected 
juniors and seniors would receive 
survey forms.
According to the new distribu­
tion plans, one hundred pre­
selected students will receive 
questionnaires on January 4. 
These students were chosen sys­
tematically from the C-Book.
Vernon Leieht, Chairman of the 
Student Congress Calendar Com­
mittee, states the the new format 
of the survey “is designed to mea­
sure the magnitude and difference 
in preference for the two calen­
dars by the students”. Leicht com­
posed the survey with the aid of 
faculty members from GSIA and 
the psychology department.
Each questionnaire will include 
a sample of the Penn-B and the 
conventional calendar.
The Penn-B calendar, described 
in the Tartan editorial of Septem­
ber 30, is a plan by which the first 
semester begins the Wednesday 
after Labor Day and ends before 
Christmas.
See Proposals Below
The calendar survey will include 
complete explanations of the two 
calendar systems and facts per­
tinent to their evaluation.
Leicht claims that “a smaller 
sampling of students tested in a 
proper manner will be both 
mathematically and psychologi­
cally valid. Thus the new poll will 
give a better evaluation of student 
opinion than the old poll would 
have done.”
Results of the calendar survey 
wil be tabulated by January 13.

Students View Model of Panther Hollow Project
Tartan Photo by Martin Shenker
Sophomore Women 
Discuss MMCC
Sophomore women discussed the 
curriculum and problems of Mar­
garet Morrison Carnegie College 
at an informal “coffee hour” on 
Monday afternoon.
Present at the discussion were 
Ewrin Steinberg and Betty Lloyd, 
deans of MMCC; Jean Renaud, 
senior, psychology; and sixteen 
MMCC sophomore women. All 
sophomore women in MMCC had 
been invited to attend.
Dean Steinberg stated that girls
complain to him about the lack 
of intellectual stimulation at the 
college, though only a very few 
have attended this semester’s spe­
cial lectures. Discussion partici­
pants tried to find a reason for 
the lack of student participation.
Commutors complained that 
special school activities are usual­
ly scheduled in the evening. Some 
students said that these activities 
conflict with their class and study 
time. No final conclusions were 
reached.
Other such “coffee hours” will 
be held next semester.
Ravine Project 
In Skibo Lobby
by Carol S. Guber
A scale model of the Pan­
ther Hollow Project, a pro­
posed $250 million building 
project, is an exhibit in the 
lobby of Skibo.
The project is presented by the 
Oakland Corporation. Carnegie 
Tech, and seven other educational, 
cultural, and, scientific organiza­
tions of Oalkand sponsor this land 
development organization.
The model is based on the plan 
or architects Harrison and Abram- 
ovitz of New York.
Panther Hollow is located be­
tween the campuses of the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh and Carnegie 
Tech, and the ravine from Forbes 
Street to the Charles Anderson 
Bridge at the Boulevard of the 
Allies.
The ten million square feet of 
usable space will contain labora­
tories, a recreational area, the­
aters, restaurants, a major com­
puter center and a data bank.
When completed in 1970, the 
estimated population of Panther 
Hollow will be 15,000 people.
The Project model was on ex­
hibit at the University of Pitts­
burgh for several months before 
it came to Tech.

Early In 1963, Ford Motor Company received a contract 
from the U.S. Army to design and develop a 5-ton cargo 
truck for use in tactical military operations. Before the end 
of that year, the first test unit had been designed and built.
This new vehicle, called the XM656 cargo truck, was sent 
to the Aberdeen Proving Ground for 40,000 miles of testing 
—twice that required for military acceptance. The vehicle 
was tested against road conditions that might be found 
•nywhere in the world: swamps... loose sand... hilly back- 
country ... and highways. During the test, the truck carried
a 10,000-lb. payload and, half the time, towed a 13,000-lb. load.
Outstanding characteristics of the truck's design are its 
floatability, improved cross-country mobility, light weight, 
reduced need for maintenance and a multi-fuel power plant 
that will run on anything from diesel oil to gasoline. 4
This is only one of many exciting new developments at 
Ford Motor Company. From manufacturing to marketing, 
we are finding better ways to do things. Career opportunities

Tartans Shoot Third in Xavier Rifle Tourney;
Beat Notre Dame, Cindnatti, and Kentucky
by Scott McCormick
Paced by the shooting of Captain Bob Fritz, the Carnegie 
Tech rifle team took the third place varsity trophy in the 
Walsh Invitational Rifle Match held at Xavier University in 
Cincinnati. The Tartans shot a 1385 to finish behind Kent 
State’s 1406 and Murray State’s 1392. Finishing third, Tech 
defeated Kentucky, Dayton, John Carroll, and Duquesne.
The match was divided into two* -
divisions, ROTC and varsity. Ohio and were allowed 30 minutes to
change, put their rifles together, 
and get on the firing line. This 
hurry-up didn’t bother anyone ex­
cept Scott McCormick who shot a 
269, his lowest score of the year. 
Rich Damberg finished at 277, and 
freshman Ted Mankovich, 276.
McCormick and Whitlatch 
changed places the next day, with 
Scott going up to 280, and Woody 
dropping to 269. Fritz and Dam­
berg repeated their scores of 284 
and 277, and Mankovich shot a 
275 to round out Carnegie’s team 
i scoring.
Mankovich has turned out to be 
the mainstay of the freshmen. He 
, consistently hits between 274 and 
| 276, and with more experience 
under his belt, he may develop 
j into a top notch shooter. Fritz has 
I levelled off at 284, and Damberg
State won the ROTC division with 
a 1393 followed by Eastern Ken­
tucky at 1392. The rest of the 
ROTC competitors, Cincinnati, 
Notre Dame, Xavier, Detroit, Ot- 
terbein and Marshall were well 
under 1370.
In the aggregate competition, 
which added the scores from the 
individual and team competitions, 
Carnegie Tech was behind only 
Ohio State and Kent State. Such 
big schools as Cincinnati, Notre 
Dame, and Kentucky did not ap­
proach C. I. T.’s total of 2772. 
Murray State, one of the top 
twenty teams in the country last 
year, could only manage a 2751. 
Ohio State’s winning score was 
2796. Kent State shot 2791.
Fritz and Woody Whitlatch won 
medals for their scores in Friday’s 
individual competition. Bob’s 284 
was good enough for seventh 
place, while Woody’s 281 quali­
fied him for tenth. Broerman of 
Kent State was high individual 
with a 289.
Coach John Murphy was 
pleased with the team’s perform­
ance, especially considering that 
no warm-up time was allowed on I 
either Friday or Saturday. On Fri­
day, the Tartans arrived at 3:00

around 277; Whitlatch and Mc­
Cormick are still jumping between 
the 280’s and the low 270’s. Fresh­
man Howard Graham showed 
promise with a 270, which in­
cluded one minus ten in the stand­
ing position. Another frosh, Leigh­
ton Westlake, turned in a 275 de­
spite a poor prone score.
Coach Murphy and the rest of 
the team were a bit surprised that 
the winning scores were as low as 
they were, but this only reflected 
on the high calibre of teams that 
Tech faces in league competition. 
Facing national champion, West 
Virginia, Indiana State, and Alle­
gheny, the winning teams in 
Xavier’s tournament would be 
hard put to finish fourth.

Tech Swimmers Win; 
Upset Westminster
Tartan freestyle strength proved to be too much for 
Westminster last Saturday, as Tech won their second swim­
ming meet of the season, 52-43.
Tartan sprinters, Hutter and^
Yahr, took first and second in 
both the 60 yard freestyle and the 
100 yard freestyle, and were the 
main stay of the 400 yard free­
style relay, on which the whole 
meet depended. Bill Cotsworth 
came through with a win in the 
500 yard freestyle for his second 
consecutive win in that event.
Westminster held the lead 
through the first six events win­
ning all but one, but the depth of 
the Tartan team then caught up 
with the Titans as the lead chang­
ed hands there times' before the 
last event. With the score 45-43, 
Tech, and the seven point freestyle 
relay up, either team could win 
in the last event, but the Tartan 
freestylers churned past the West­
minster relay with a noteworthy 
time of 3:49.0.
High scorers for Tech were 
Hutter with 11.75, Cotsworth with
8 and Yahr with 7.75. Leading the 
Titan squad with wins in the 160 
yard individual medley and the 
200 yard backstrokt was Dudek 
with 11.75 points.
Tech team captain, Dave Specht 
won the 200 yard breast stroke 
for the second meet in a row, bet­
tering the old team record with a 
time of 2:38.9.
The Tartan do not swim again 
until January 9, when they face
SAE, Grads 
Volleyball 
Favorites
With only the semi-finals and 
finals remaining in I. M. Volley­
ball, SAE still remains as the 
favorite, but the Grad Nads loom 
as the dark horse candidates who 
could spoil everything for the 
Morewood Avenue team.
SAE’s “B” team reached the 
semi-finals by whipping BSR in 
two straight sets, 15-4, and 15-8. 
Meanwhile, the Grad Nads dis­
posed of GSIA by claiming a close 
16-14 victory in the third and de­
ciding game.
SAE “A” entered the semi-finals 
on the strength of a 15-7 and 15-8 
defeat of PKT, while BTP “A” 
took the Fern Docs in three sets 
to complete the field.
SAE “B” is favored to defeat j 
BTP, as are the Grad Nads to de- ; 
ftat SAE “A” although SAE “A” 
is undefeated up until now, and no I 
team that has gone this far in j 
league play and kept an unblem- j 
ished record can be discounted. | 
I However, an SAE ‘B”-Grad Nad 
final would be ironic in the sense 
that the Nads have already beaten 
SAE in regular league play. At 
any rate, the semi-finals and finals 
promise a lot of good volleyball 
for the spectators, and possibly a 
few surprises.

You
really
know
how to hurt 
a guy!
Got a second? Lend an ear. Dodge’s all 
new, hot new Coronet 500 has got an 
awful lot going for it (besides your girl). 
For instance: buckets and backup lights, 
full carpeting and a console, spinners 
and a padded dash—all standard equip­
ment. More? Much I Like an engine 
lineup that would make any car squeal 
for joy: 273, 318, 361, 383 or 426 cubic
inches. Like a lean and hungry look. And 
like a low, low price tag—Coronet costs 
less than any full-size Dodge in years. 
We can't hope to make you a believer 
with an ad, so we'd like to extend an in­
vitation-come and see the 1965 Coronet 
500 at your nearest Dodge dealer’s. 
Bring your girl along ... it makes for 
a cheap date.

Tartans Lose B-Ball To Grove Gty; 
Come Back To Beat Waynesburg
By Tom Terpack
After absorbing their fourth straight defeat at the hands 
of the Grove City Wolverines, 76-58, last week, Carnegie 
Tech’s Tartans, led by Jeff Kalin and Pete Riccardella, whip­
ped Waynesburg, 84-76, for their first win of the season.
As usual, the Tartans took an^ 
early lead against Grove City,
^laying slow, deliberate ball. The
game was so slow, in fact, that 
after eight minutes of the first 
half, the score stood 12-6, in favor 
of Tech. Any early optimism was 
unfounded, however, since Grove 
City had nineteen men dressed, 
seven of whom were 6’-4” or bet­
ter. Coach Cliff Wettig kept sub­
stituting constantly, and, playing 
on the full-size court, the under­
manned Tartans quickly became 
exhausted.
Grove City tied up the contest, 
14-14, with 9:35 remaining in the 
first half, and from there went on 
to take a 30-24 half-time lead.
The second half quickly turn­
ed into a comedy of errors. Coach 
Mel Cratsley, when asked why 
Tech’s uniforms had “TECH” in 
script down the side of the pants, 
replied that it was for purpose of 
identification. To be effective 
against Grove City, ihe lettering 
should have been in flashing neon, 
Tech threw the ball away so many 
times.
tremendous hustling show, being 
all over the court at one time.
Tartans Taste Victory
Against Waynesburg, Tech final­
ly moved into the victory column, 
something which was beginning to 
seem highly doubtful. Tech took a 
quick lead of 9-0, with Jeff Kalin 
scoring seven of the nine points.
Once in the lead, Tech was 
never less than seven ahead. The 
Yellow jackets were down at half- 
time, 45-31, but came to within 
nine points with fourteen minutes 
left, 56-47. Tech, however, scored 
10 quick points to put the game 
on ice, and went on to win, 84-76.
Kalin again led Tech, with 
Pete Riccardella not far behind. 
Kalin had 24 points and 19 re­
bounds, and Riccardella ended up 
with 19 points and 12 rebounds. 
Another bright spot was George
McGeary, whose non-rebounding 
has been sorely apparent in the 
first four games. McGeary ended 
up with nine rebounds, and may 
be back in the groove.
The season so far has been 
centered around Jeff Kalin, who 
has been averaging 18 points and 
16 rebounds per game. Pete Ric­
cardella and Jim Newell are also 
coming around.
Home games this week are 
against Baldwin-W a 11 a c e, a 
perennial power, tonight, and 
Thiel Thursday night.

scoring at will, Grove City pulled 
away easily to win 76-58.
