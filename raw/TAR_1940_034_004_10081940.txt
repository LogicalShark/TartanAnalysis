Student Models 
To Be Featured.
In Fashion Revue
If you’re one of those persons 
who read between lines, then you 
have seen that Tech-in-color is 
here tò stay. If you look at the 
bulletin boards, yo.uJve seen that 
Tech-in-color is here to stay. If 
you haven’t, then now you do 
know. It’s here! Well, almost 
here. November 1 is the date, but 
let’s start all over again, and tell 
thè news.
Script By Hunt 
Tech-in-color has been edging 
in on the margins of the TARTAN 
for several weeks now, but at last 
it comes out on its own. T.-I.-C. is 
not C. I. T. in reverse, but is the 
name of the super-fashion-review- 
tea-dance that will be presented 
in the Gym on Friday, November 
1. Frank and Seder’s and the 
TARTAN are jointly sponsoring 
this unusual affair to show Tech- 
ites how to dress comfortably, 
well, and at the same time, ap­
propriately. In other words, you’ll 
learn “What To Wèar, Where.” 
The clothes will be the pick of 
the creamy crop of Frank and Se­
der’s department store; the mod­
els will be those of you who mea­
sure up (or down) to the specifi­
cations; and the music will be the 
tootlings of a local “name” band.
Ed Hunt, ’41, Carnegie’s play­
wright, who is preparing the script 
for the show, says that the con­
tinuity will be carried by two 
narrators, one male and one fe­
male, and will tell the story of 
the “ugly duckling” in campus 
clothes.
All Student Cast 
Not only will T. I. C.’s models be 
provided With several changes of 
costume, but. they will be given 
expert advice on modelling, in ad­
dition to being made up and hair- 
styled by professionals. All men 
and women, interested in talcing 
part will please report to the 
TARTAN office, third floor of the 
Union at 4:30 tomorrow afternoon. 
Come on you men, if Chang does 
it, why Dunn’t you?
To make it a complete Carnegie 
production, all staging, scenery, 
and lighting will be done by Tech 
students, so all you P&D’s, you 
Architects, you engineers, you 
Engineers, you ENGINEERS come 
to the Tartan office at 4:30 tomor­
row, too, , and help work out this 
fashion show and tea dance (free, 
folks).

"Come On Chilluiis”
Scotch ?n Soda Begins Activity 
With Student Dancing Classes
This is the fourth year for 
Scotch and Soda, and we got to 
thinking sadly that this means it’s 
the last year in which the charter 
members of the Club will work 
on the show—unless they’re archi­
tects, or special five-year people, 
or unless they come back for 
something. But on the whole., it 
means that there are people now 
who have grown up at Tech with 
Scotch and Soda—who have 
worked on the show when they 
were fi\eshmen and who will 
work on it now that they’re sen­
iors.
But there are also a lot of peo­
ple who are freshmen now, or 
transfers, or something, who 
would make swell Scotch and Soda 
members. Thing is, though, they’ve 
got to know what Scotch and 
Soda is—besides that concoction 
of fizz water and something ab­
solutely unmentionable that Car­
negie women don’t drink. So let s 
make this another history course— 
S&S 004. Read the article and 
get your “A.”
In the spring of 1938, some en­
terprising entrepeneurs got to­
gether and wrote scripts, compos­
ed songs and made costumes and 
built scenery and painted it, and 
learned lines and figured out danc­
es, and in general dreamed up a 
show called “No Strings. It was 
the first annual All-Carnegie, all­
student musical revue, and from 
it Scotch and Soda was born.
After the show, the people con­
cerned with it-thought that
something ought to be done to see 
to it that the spring revue became 
a yearly thing, like Pitt Cap and 
Gown—only better, of course, and 
with girls in it. So they formed 
a club out of everyone who had 
worked on “No Strings,” named it 
the Scotch and Soda Club, got duly 
chartered by council, and started 
planning the 1939 show.
And so it went, with people 
graduating, and more people be­
coming eligible for membership in 
Scotch and Soda, and bigger and 
better revues produced every year. 
In 1939 it was “Take it Straight,” 
and last year it was “One On the 
House.” and what this year’s is 
going to be—is as much up to 
you. gentle reader, as to anyone.
Although this is early in the 
year, Scotch and Soda activities 
have already started. For the first 
thing, last Saturday saw the be­
ginnings of a tap-dancing class, 
for any Carnegie student who^ 
wants to join. It’s taught by the“ 
dance director of the last two 
shows, Shirley Brown, and by the 
dance director of the last revue 
and the coming revue—Rolley 
Kraus. 10:30, every Saturday 
morning, Thistle Hall.
More informally, everyone who 
can write has been working away 
furiously on scripts for the skits 
of this year’s show. And on songs. 
So if you have an idea, don’t sew 
a button .on to it—just write it 
down and maybe it’ll oe used in 
the 1941 production ox Cne Scotch 
and Soda show.

Along With Gov.
On Thanksgiving
Thanksgiving Recess will begin 
on the last Thursday of Novem­
ber, the 28th, according to a vote 
of the Executive Board of Car­
negie Institute of l*ectinologj\ 
President Roosevelt declared 
that Thanksgiving would again be 
on the third Thursday of Novem­
ber. Last year Governor James of 
Pennsylvania went along with the 
President; however, this yeap, the 
Governor has set the last Thurs­
day in November as Thanksgiving 
Day. Consequently, Carnegie Tech 
is going to string along with 
Pennsylvania.
All events scheduled in the 
Plebe Bible for the new recess pe­
riod will have to be changed by 
the parties concerned with the ex­
ception of the Tech-Duquesne 
football game.
Seniors To Pose 
For Photographs
Senior pictures for the Thistle 
will be taken during the next, two 
weeks. Representatives of Gimbels 
will be in the Administration 
Building, College of Fine Arts, and 
M. M. C. C. from 11:30 to 1:20 
Mondays through Fridays.
Seniors must pay $2.00 which 
will cover the cost of the pictures 
and a copy of the Thistle. Sittings 
will begin on Wednesday, October 
9, 1940, at Gimbel’s Department 
store.
Professor Writes 
New Text-Book 
For Musicians
Lily likes it, so it must be good. 
And who’s Lily? She’s Pop’s most 
severe critic. And who is Pop- 
he’s Dr. Max Schoen, Head of the 
Psychology and Education Depart­
ment. And he’s just written a 
book, “The Psychology of Music,” 
his fifth book to date.
In the preface of his book, 
which was placed on the United 
States bookmarts last week, Dr. 
Schoen says:“. . . I have tried to 
present a survey of those research 
studies in the psychology of music 
that I felt has a most direct bear­
ing on musical art, musical artis­
try, and music education. Intend­
ed primarily for the musician who 
ig interested in the psychology of 
his art, the book also presents a 
convenient summary of research 
accomplishments for the use of 
psychologists and school-music 
teachers.
Dr. Schoen, himself, is of great 
interest to Carnegie students.

Council Representative“Craig’s Wife”
The first nighters are in their 
seats and the curtain is about to 
rise on “Craig’s Wife.” The cur­
rent production marks the open­
ing of; the twenty-seventh season 
for the Drama Department.
"Craig’s Wife,” Pulitzer Prize 
play for 1926, was written by 
George Kelly, and is being pro­
duced under the direction of Mr. 
Douglas McLean. It is one of Mr. 
Kelly’s admirable studies of con­
temporary character. Mrs. Craig 
is a full-length portrait of a 
woman of tremendous power, who 
through selfishness succeeds in 
driving from her home her hus­
band, his friends, and her rela­
tives. It is a tense and biting satire 
on human nature—an exceptional 
play which pursues a serious mo­
tif, yet does not become melo­
dramatic.
A worthy cast deserves recogni­
tion: Mrs. Craig will be played by 
Elizabeth Root ’42, and Helene 
Jaffin ’41; Mr. Craig, Marvin Ein- 
horn ’42 and Edward Hunt ’41; 
Miss Austin, Ann Marshall Price 
’42; Mrs. Frazier, Dorothy O’Dell 
’41 and Hazel Shermet ’41; Ethel, 
Judith Wirkman ’43 and Marisse 
Forbes ’42. Also in the cast are 
Herbert Brovvnr '4.1, Robert Chal- 
lener ’42, Ruth Fischer ’43, Esther 
Jane Coryell ’41, Alice Morgan 
’43, Barbara Burns '43, Roland 
Kraus ’42, Christopher Smith ’43, 
Lester Stanford ’43, Richard Rose, 
Michael Sivy '43, Robert Healy 
’43.
The play will run from Satur­
day,'October 19, to Saturday, Oc­
tober 26. Scene of the drama will, 
be the Little Theater in the Fine 
Arts Building. Tickets will be 
,available, free ol! charge, in the 
•Registrar’s Officfe in Industries by 
Monday, October 14. A matinee, 
for which no tickets will be re­
quired, is to be given on Thurs­
day, Oetobcr ?A.
Landau Speaks 
To Math Club
Carnegie Tech’s Mathematics 
Club will hold its first meeting 
at 3:30 on Friday. October 11, in 
Room 201, Engineering Hall. A 
talk on “Topology” will be given 
by H. G. Landau of the Coal Re­
search Laboratory.
Topology is a branch of geom­
etry. While not new, its intensive 
development has been compara­
tively recent so that it1'is still an 
infant among mathematical sci­
ences.
The Mathematics Club is an un­
dergraduate organization whose 
purpose is to develop a better un­
derstanding and appreciation of 
mathematics, and to do it pleas­
antly.
The club inaugurated, its second 
year last week by electing Ed­
ward L. Kaplan, ’41, President; 
Ralph E. Beatty, ’42, Vice-Presi­
dent; Walter E. Stuermann, ’41, 
Secretary, and Norman I-I. Paint­
er, ’42, Treasurer. Professor J. B. 
Rosenbach is the Faculty Advisor. 
The talks and discussions of the 
club deal with aspects of mathe­
matics which are not taken up 
in the usual undergraduate cours­
es. All students and faculty mem­
bers who are interested are invit­
ed to attend the meetings and to 
take part in the discussions.
’41 Thistle Staff 
To Begin Work
On Friday afternoon, October 
11, at 4:30, the Thistle staff will 
hold its first meeting of the year 
in Carnegie Union. At this time 
all Freshmen, Sophomores and 
Juniors interested in year book 
work should report.
When the Delta Skulls received 
the questionaires on freshmen in­
terested in Thistle work, there 
were about 30 who signed up.
The Thistle is a publication of 
the Junior Class and will be ready 
for distribution about the time 
of Spring Carnival. Activity Keys 
were awarded for two and three 
year participation and activity 
points are also given.
Dr. H. T. Kerr
Dr. Kerr Talks 
At Carnegie’s 
First Chapel
Rev. Hugh Thompson Kerr will 
be the speaker at Carnegie’s first 
chapel service today at 11:30 in 
the Little Theater. President Do­
herty will preside at the chapel, 
and the chapel choir will sing 
“God Be In My Head,” by. E. J. 
Chapman. Organist will be Ev­
elyn Dible, ’42.
Rev. Kerr, minister for twenty- 
seven years at the Shadyside 
Proa by ter Ian Church is well- 
known to Carnegie students. He 
has been guiding Teknon, student 
organization, for twenty years as 
well as helping the Y. M. C. A. 
and Y. W. C. A. Last year’s bac­
calaureate address was made by 
Rev. Kerr.
Chapel was first instituted in 
1921 at Carnegie,’when it was held 
on alternate weeks. It was fast 
approved by the student body, 
and has became a feature on the 
campus.
The choir or glee club is com­
posed of members from all the 
colleges, who meet once daily. Al­
though tryouts have already been 
held under the direction of Miss 
Geraldine I-Iamman, ’41, those 
who wish to do so may join at 
any time during the school year. 
Miss I-Iamman has been director 
of the choir since it was first or­
ganized.
Tuesday’s chapel will be spon­
sored by Interfraternity Council.
Band Leaves
Kiltie Band Goes 
To Holy Cross
By Arvid Fogclberff
Tech’s unique Kiltie Band will 
give Holy Cross fans an extra treat 
at the Tech-Holy Cross game on 
October 12.
Every year the band accompan­
ies the team to at least one game 
away from Pittsburgh. The Kil­
ties look forward to putting on 
one of their finest shows at that 
game. This year will be no excep­
tion. Paul Wines, Tech’s champion 
drum-major has worked out a se­
ries of tricky drills for the game, 
and the Kilties know every move­
ment to be made.
Leaving Friday morning, the 
Kilties anticipate a meal of Boston 
baked beans that evening. The 
Worcester citizens will hear not 
only the strains of “Dear Old 
Tech” and “Fight For the Glory 
of Carnegie,” but also “Rhum- 
boogie” and “Pennsylvania Sixty- 
Five Thousand,” rendered by 
groups of Kilties, who have had 
nothing to do but drill, drill, drill, 
since practice started.
Even though the Kilties always 
make an impressive showing, they 
w’ould appreciate a solid rooting 
section behind them. Follow the 
Kilties!
Maggies io Elect 
Ass't Sec’y; Frosh, 
Transfers to Vote
Engineers will choose between 
Frank Jordano and Lester Cullen 
for Vice President of Engineering; 
Senate, today from 11:30 to 1:30. 
The vacancy is due to the inelig­
ibility of Kurth Johnson, Inde­
pendent who was elected to that 
office last April.
Whether or not the Big Seven 
will have a majority of the votes 
in Student Council depends on the 
outcome of this election. Jordano, 
who is active in football, repre­
sents the Big Seven. Lester Cul­
len was chairman of the campaign 
committee for the Independents 
during last semester’s election.
Johnson, who was elected to the 
Engineering Senate, last spring, 
forfeited the office because of an 
ineligibility factor.
Maggie Murphs will also go to 
the polls, today, to choose an As­
sistant Secretary of Student Coun­
cil. The nominees are Ursula Fey, 
Joanne Tishlarich, and Dorothy 
Piper.
All students presenting Athletic 
Cards will be able to vote. This 
includes freshmen and transfer 
students who were not In school 
last semester.
Contrary to plans as announced 
in the last issue of the Tartan, the 
Intramural board will appoint 
rather than elect two members. 
They must bo commuters with no 
fraternity affiliations. Having 
these requirements the members 
of the board should tend to bo 
more impartial.
Draft Holiday
In order that all faculty mem­
bers tind students who aré be­
tween the ages of 21 and 36 
may have an opportunity to 
register for the draft, the Ad­
ministration has announced 
that all classes, in both the Day 
and Evening Schools, will bo 
suspended on Wednesday, Oc­
tober 16.
IRC Activities 
Begin Tomorrow
The International Relations 
Club will hold its first meeting 
tomorrow in the old Faculty Club 
Room, Administration Hall, at 
3:30. All Tech women are invited 
to attend. Pleqse sign your nam6 
on the notice on either the Fresh­
man or Upperclass bulletin boards 
in Margaret Morrison before noon, 
October 9.
IRC’s purpose is primarily to- 
discuss. It takes no partisan stand 
as a group, and its membei-s rep­
resent many shades of political 
opinion. It has its counterpart on 
other college campuses through-^ 
out the country. These groups are 
all sponsored by the Carnegie In­
ternational Peace Foundation.
The club adds variety to its reg­
ular meetings with dinners and 
parties. In addition, it collects lit­
erature on contemporary affairs.
The Sunday New York Times 
and the most current magazines 
can always be found on the rack 
in the Margaret Morrison stud^ 
hall. The club also has .a .fine, col­
lection of books pertaining to cur­
rent problems, which the student 
body is welcome to use.

Letters to the Editor
To the Editor:
In answer to Mr. Stuerman’s 
letter, which appeared in last 
week’s TARTAN, I should like to 
make a few brief comments.
There is a federal law which 
says, in effect, that any person can 
address any type of gathering on 
any subject; but that as soon as 
this person tells even a close friend 
. a way to avoid the draft he is com­
mitting an act of conspiracy. Upon 
Spahr Hull’s own admission his 
address included a discussion of 
ways and means of avoiding the 
draft. Whether the above law is 
good or bad is not under discussion 
—it is a law, and it is the duty of 
each citizen to see that laws are 
observed. Point number one.
Secondly, last week’s letter stat­
ed that the attendants at this meet­
ing were all conscientious ob­
jectors. Granted—but if they 
WERE conscientious objectors they, 
had nothing to fear from con-] 
scription, so why hold a meeting 
to discuss its horrors?
Thirdly, if Mr. Hull had mere­
ly been the principal speaker at 
the meeting under discussion he 
would have had to answer many 
questions no doubt, but he would 
not have been under the suspicion 
he has fallen under now. It ap­
pears, however, that Hull was not 
only the guest speaker but the or­
ganizer of said meeting—a com­
pletely private affair! We are o 1 
course open to adverse opinion— 
but we wonder.
And lastly, Mr. Hull was not 
suspended from his position in 
the high school because he might 
have been a member of some col­
umn—as intimated in last week’s 
letter—but because, being under 
suspicion of any kind, he would 
bring to the school with which he 
was affiliated unpleasant noteriety.
Perhaps if Mr. Hull, the F. B. I. 
the local newspapers and the high 
school officials had used more tact 
and diplomacy much noteriety 
would have been averted.
PAUL GUINTI-IER.
Editor’s note: We cannot refrain 
from some comments of our own. 
Mr. Spahr Hull’s case proves that 
conscription can have horrors, 
even if you are a conscientious ob­
jector. . Mr. Hull was a victim of 
hysteria, bigotry and narrowmind­
edness even though he may never 
be conscripted and stuffed into a 
uniform.
England, which happens to be 
at war, is liberal enough to per­
mit conscientious objectors to 
hold mock trials in which they 
practice answering the qiLestions 
w hich draftdo dgers-investigators 
may fire at them. This is a lot 
more serious than the “crime” 
Spahr Hull committed. As a mat­
ter of fact several such mock- 
trials have already been held in 
New York. Furthermore since the 
Draft Bill specifically exempts 
conscientious objectors, the pro­
vision on draft dodging cannot 
possibly apply to them. The law 
is obviously aimed at shyster 
laioyers and wardheelers.
We’re afraid that the fuss over 
Mr. Hull is due to the fact that we 
have a district attorney of the 
variety of oTd maid who insists 
on an FBI investigation of the 
floor under her bed before retir­
ing.
To the Editor:
Everyone has been so concern­
ed of late with the big and lit­
tle sister movement that no one 
has given a thought to a much 
needed big brother movement. As 
an M. M. C. C. freshman and a 
very devoted little sister, I think 
a “big brother” is an absolute nec­
essity . Such a movement could no 
longer benefit the class of ’44, but 
it could prevent our successors 
from experiencing that “holding- 
up-the-wall” feeling at tea dances. 
For an innocent unsophisticated 
coed who comes to the big city for 
the first time, there is only one
fate ---------- wall flowering
at all the affairs, unless, of course, 
she is lucky enough to meet the 
right people.
Attacking the problem from a 
man’s angle, I doubt whether I 
could find one male on campus 
who wouldn’t relish the idea of a 
smooth “little sister” coming to 
him for—advice. He could intro­
duce her to all the big shots and 
see that she ¿ot around; or if he 
didn’t care for competition, he 
could do the honors himself.
Here’s hoping that in the fu­
ture, “big brothers” as well as 
big sisters can aid in making the 
freshman year more interesting for 
a lot of bewildered newcomers.

Colleg es Only 
“Mis-edu-cate”
By Walter Stull
In the October issue of the Am­
erican Mercury appears an article 
entitled “A Psychiatrist Indicts 
Education,” by Dr. Charles Bur- 
lingrame of the Neuro-Psychia­
tric Institute of the Hartford Re­
treat.
Dr. Burlingrame maintains that 
"misfits, malcontents and depend­
ents” are being bred by, and the 
nation’s mental hospitals filled 
with the broken-down products 
of, undiscriminate and unrealistic 
education.”
Modern education, according to 
the author, teaches in theory only; 
and when faced with the condi­
tions of practice in employment, 
graduates are usually unable to 
meet the test. The sheltered camp­
us life is contrary to existence in 
after-graduate years; yet students 
are encouraged to believe they 
will have no more difficulty in 
life than in the classroom.
Almost anyone with money can 
muddle through to a degree, re­
gardless of intellectual abilities, 
while many of those who would 
really profit most from higher ed­
ucation cannot financially com­
pete for it. He compares giving a 
degree to an average student to 
putting a quart of milk in a pint 
bottle, “something only an idiot 
would attempt.”

Due to the fact that Mr. Jor- 
dano’8 activities have kept him 
mo:\e in the student eye, the TAR­
TAN is running the following to 
acquaint- those students who do 
no more than follow the football 
games with Mr. Cullen’s activities.
Calls himself a campus politi­
cian but hands out no cigars . . , 
because he doesn’t smoke them 
. . . Chemical Engineering senior 
with a past . . . graduated from 
Schenley High School went to 
New York University for one se­
mester . . . spent a year in the 
Army . . . before he came to Tech 
... in addition to being an active 
member of the Independent Party, 
he is Editor of Technical, Presi­
dent of Citcom Clan, member of 
Scabbard and Blade, Theta Tau 
—the Engineering honorary, and 
American Institute of Chemical 
Engineers.

cause he used to play a mean fid­
dle when a tot . . . also likes to 
dance but never got beyond the 
trying stage in jitterbugging . . . 
along the feminine line, Les is 
non-committal . . . likes all kind, 
so he says . . . never took Greek 
but has had Gamma trouble . . .
Two positions on Student Coun­
cil were declared vacant at last 
week’s Council meeting, and a 
motion was made that elections be 
held today.
The offices, Vice President of 
Engineering Senate and Assistant 
Secretary of Student Council, have 
been vacated because of ineligibil­
ity. A resolution passed in 1926 
provides that elections of succes­
sors be held within a week after 
the office is vacated.
The Social Calendar for 1940- 
41 and five petitions for dances 
were approved. The TARTAN 
budget was also approved.
The Council then made the Ap­
propriations and Spirit Commit­
tee a permanent institute through 
a motion by Janet Stover, Chair­
man. The purpose of the commit­
tee is (1) to investigate yearly the 
expenditure of the student activi­
ties fee and (2) to investigate the 
possibility of "'Swarding scholar­
ships rather than salaries to those 
people holding positions on publi­
cations and Student Council.
Paul Wines asked that someone 
investigate the possibility of 
Council buying sound equipment 
at cost.
A committee of Messrs. Heil­
man, Horigan-, Loveday, Lange, 
Jacobson, Wills and Misses Wil­
liams and Cramer was named to 
investigate a bill which would re-
Freshmen Elect 
Representative
At 8:00 o’clock Friday night 
twenty-four freshmen met in­
formally in McGill Hall to elect 
a non-voting freshman represen­
tative to the Men’s Dormitory 
Council.
James Voelz volunteered to act 
as temporary chairman of the 
meeting. Four men were nominat­
ed. James Voelz was elected by 
10 votes. Representative Voelz 
says that he will represent the 
frosh to the best of his ability. He 
is of the opinion that he represents 
“a pretty swell bunch of fresh­
men.”
Don’t l oiiipl a in --Vote!
Today’s election will be in more than one sense a test of the 
Carnegie student body. Ordinarily an election which involves 
:>nly one seat on »Student Council might be easily passed over as 
something not very important to the life of the college. However, 
today’s election is unique in several-respects.
Students who remember last year’s election will recall the 
high feeling that prevailed on the campus at that time. A great 
deal of startling information was presented to the student in 
order to awaken him from a lethargy of approximately ten years 
duration. No one was surprised when the independents won last 
year’s campaign.
, Hut we are dealing with a slightly different matter today. 
The justification for control, of Student Council by a minority 
was “that the average student does not care about Student Coun­
cil politics.” The TARTAN is forced to agree with that argu- 
'nent. In other words if the student does not care about Student 
Oouiic.il politics, then he has no right to object when a small group 
takes control of Student Council and runs it as it' sees fit. Only 
those students who take an interest can justifiably complain.
Last year’s election was no real test. It was to be expected 
that the sudden disclosure ol? some startling facts would jar the 
utucic*.ri (- body sufficiently to bring out a record vote. What will 
really decide the future of Student Council is whether such an in­
terest in Student Council elections can be .sustained for more than 
two or three weeks.
Today’s election is crucial enough to turn the tide in Stu- 
lent Council one way or the other. Whether Student Council 
will he controlled by fraternities or not will, be determined to a 
large extent by who wins the election in Engineering School to­
il 'dy-
If the fraternity candidate wins, it will not be a question of 
‘dirty politics or cramming ballot boxes.” It will simply mean 
that the members of the big seven fraternity group are sufficient­
ly interested and sufficiently organized to elect men to council 
and that the apathy of the student body makes it possible for them 
l;o do so. In a sense YOU will elect the Big Seven by not voting.
The decision is up to you. You can settle student issues and 
you can settle the composition of the Student Council by voting. 
Tl: you don’t vote, someone else will settle the issues for you. But 
if you don’t vote, please don’t crab about the way Student Council, 
works.
Ssagar Coated Conscription
The TARTAN herewith reprints an important editorial from 
the “Intercollegian” which describes itself as “a journal of the
student Christian movement dedicated to the Christian world
community. The editorial deals with a topic which for some un­
known reason has become almost taboo.
When conscription comes, America enters a new epoch,
for conscription and its by-products are revolutionary to the
highest degree and their effects will be felt in every area of 
our life. Where it hits the student first is on enrollment-: 
Military Science will displace that course on Astronomy or 
maybe it was Art of the Pre-Ming Dynasty that you wanted 
i to take. Then, inevitably, the military influence seeps into 
the teacher’s presentation of material and thus is transplant­
ed into the student’s mind. The natty uniforms will go over 
big on the campus and girl’s clothes will gather such dash­
ing details as epaulets and brass buttons. Movies and the 
press will feature military heroes and it will not be long 
before the “year of service” becomes a badge of respecta­
bility and those who have not served become suspected as 
slackers or worse. Most serious, from the viewpoint of ed­
ucation, is the effect of military training on the thinking ap­
paratus. The traditional American way (on the campus) is 
to debate, to argue, to concede the right to the holding of 
opposing viewpoints. But under military training the high­
est virtue is implicit obedience and the greatest treason is 
independent thought or action.
These considerations need to be given a place as we con­
template conscription. In days of regimentation they will help 
ns to remember the tang ol! educational freedom and its task 
in this totalitarian world.
P. S. Lest sonie of us think that conscription is not as serious 
is it may sound, the TARTAN would like to make public this 
'athcr interesting fact. For the past three years while the War 
Xepartment was. working on the conscription bill and on plans 
ior M-I)ay, they were also working on the possibility of expand- 
ng ol! American industry to meet war needs. One section of this 
iurvey which has for obvious reasons not received too much pub­
licity, is the check-up on the available supply of caskets for burial 
11‘you are interested in the uniform you will ULTIMATELY 
wear, address the Advertising Funeral Directors of America, 
purposes. Members ol! the War Department have been working 
closely with the Advertising Funeral Directors of America to 
insure an adequate supply. The Major in charge of helping the 
casket industry expand, explained the survey as “just a simple 
matter of being prepared with essentials. Caskets are just like 
all the other gadgets we use.”

The Council approved an 
amendment to the Dorm Council 
Constitution, which provides that 
no more than one fraternity man 
for each dormitory be permitted 
to serve on Dorm Council.
At the end of the meeting Mr. 
Sions moved that a resolution 
which would give the President of 
Council a salary rather than the 
checking concession be tabled un­
til the meeting to-night.
24 Graduates 
Study Social Work
Although unknown to many 
Carnegie students, a Graduate De­
partment of Social Work has been 
functioning in Margaret Morrison 
for three or four years. This school 
offers courses leading to a Mas­
ters’ degree in Social Work.
Twenty-four students are en­
rolled this year, fifteen of which 
are former students at Carnegie. 
- The other nine students did their 
undergraduate work at other col­
leges, among which are Pitt, City 
College of New York, Connecticut 
College for Women, Slippery Rock, 
College of Charleston, Duquesne 
University, Columbia University, 
and Allegheny College. Advanced 
standing from other graduate 
schools of social work has been 
accredited to several of the stu­
dents.
The degree of Master of Social 
Work will be awarded to eight of 
these graduate-students in June, 
1941, an interesting parallel to last 
June, at which time eight Master 
degrees were also awarded.
Editors Surprised
“Common Sense” national pro- 
Roosevelt liberal monthly recent­
ly held a straw poll among its 
readers. Much to the surprise of 
the editors, Socialist Candidate 
Norman Thomas walked away 
with it. Thomas, incidentally, will 
speak in Pittsburgh on November 
1.

Over the Saddle
Hiking, Biking and Dancing Will 
Provide a Vacation Full of Fun
“Give me tlie dust of the highway 
And a breeze that kisses my face— 
For, oh, I am tired of liurry,
Of traffic and market place!
Give me a spring by the wayside,
Give me a tree for shade—
And an open road and a wide road,
And a heart that is unafraid! * ’
By Margaret Goodman
Off The Cuff
Small Atttendance Brain Teaser
Comes vacation, when the ink is 
scarcely dry on the last exam, it’s 
time to chuck the old textbooks 
and the slide-rule for a trade- 
in on new adventure: hosteling, 
the thrill of new trails. Away with 
the machine age! If you’ve got to 
see the country through a window 
pane, you just haven’t lived. In 
fact, you’re still a bald and shining 
red infant, an A-B-C vitamizer, 
and a self-deprived mug-Wump.
ute-picked tomatoes perked us up 
pronto . . . Spaghetti and meat 
balls, rabbit fruit, and blue-ber­
ries with thick cream were fit 
food for healthy, wind-blown 
hostelers.
There were twenty of us the 
'first night; and as fast as forty 
hands could pump and heat water, 
the dishes were done up spic and 
span, lickety split. Around the open 
fire, the flames and sparks from
Hiking or biking by your own 
steam along the open road, swim­
ming in cool mountain lakes and 
streams, buying soda crackers 
from a barrel in the general gro­
cery store, “pow-wowing” with 
songs, shouts, and dances at the 
hostels (over-night accommoda­
tions), and meeting the greatest 
lads and lassies from all over the 
world—that’s real fun.
Over the saddle! The signal for 
adventure to begin. Whether we 
could ride a bike or not was real­
ly incidental to us, as we waved 
good-bye to Lib and Bob in North- 
field. “Sugar Hill or bust!” was 
all that mattered, White Moun­
tains or no White Mountains. The 
first day’s trek only defied the 
law of gravitation, for right from 
the start we learned, “What goes 
down must come up!” Over every 
knoll, a hill, and over every hill 
a mountain, and on top of the 
last the hostel. Saddle-sore, but 
undampened in spirits, we gang 
of weary hostelers dragged our­
selves and bikes into the bam.
Then our spirits took a flying 
leap. The sapid smells of ham­
burger, chowder, corn, and min-
the birch wood dancing high in 
the cold night air, we did the old 
rounds and barn dances: “Pickin’ 
up Paw-paws,” “Shoo-Fly,” “A 
Tisket, A Tasket,” and some new 
Palestinian war-whoop fling. 
Chipping in two cents (a hostel­
er has to budget his dollar a day 
for food and 30-cent lodging and 
fuel charge) we finished up toast­
ing marshmallows on the dying 
embers. Then as the last sparks 
were snuffed out (10 o’clock) we 
said good-night and the boys and 
girls, tired but oh-so-happy, hop­
ped off to their respective hay­
stacks. This was our first day, on­
ly a prelude to the “This-is-the- 
life” hosteling.
Well, here we are again with 
the latest diggings in the dirt.
Funniest sight of the week: Jim 
Graves passing his dog and his 
love letters all over Skibo.
Why does Ed Spryer continue to 
play “The Lone Ranger” around 
these parts? He’s even minus a 
horse.
We’re surprised at Jimmy 
Balmer for letting “Petie” McCall 
slip through his fingers. It looks 
like his whole Fraternity is com­
peting with l\im now!!
Jane Frear is in a bad way— 
she only has Dave Ellis, Don 
French, Jim Graves and Hal Dix­
on to choose from.
Overheard by our secret agent 
X-21. “He’s darling, but he lives 
in Australia, and you can’t love 
by long distance, ya’ know.” That 
sounds suspiciously like Bobbie 
Breakstone.
Most consistent duet of the 
week: Bill Ey and Doris Bickel.
What made Chuck Dobson 
change his mind about having a 
date last Saturday?? We wonder.
Jan Grove continues to tell us 
about “the boy from home.” Well 
New Kensington isn’t too far, but • 
what’s wrong with the local tal­
ent?
And then there’s the Bob Mc- 
Cutcheon-Frances Carlock com­
bination—
And now it’s Audrey Bodkin 
who has become the Stag Line De­
light.
Chauncey French always goes to 
those Tea Dances, but why is he 
content just to take Peggy Nellis 
home??
The R. O. T. C. boys seem to 
be lost without Helen Price.
Why can’t Sylvan Rosenfield
find a permanent fourth for his 
bridge game?
Rumor has it that Cal Oakes 
will replace AI Minetti in the 
Institute cheer. How about that, 
boys??
The season’s first Tea Spill oc­
curred last Thursday when Bob 
Coxvie knocked Babs Bums’ tea out 
of her hand. Are you trying cave­
man tactics, now??
There was another kind of spill 
at the same place, too. It seems 
that Bob Campbell tripped and 
by the time he got up, Aleta Corn­
elius was dancing with someone 
else. Such is life.
Notes on Baclc-to-Childhood: 
Bob Johnson was seen energetical­
ly riding a scooter around the 
. Arts school the other day.
Helen Hershey averaged about 
four steps apiece with the fellows 
at last week’s dance. Nice going, 
there, Helen.
Ask any of the Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon boys how to waste time 
with a sugar bowl. The record at 
the time this goes to press is six­
teen minutes, thirty-seven and 
one-half seconds.
Items of Interest: The boys are 
not the only ones who are con­
scription conscious these days! 
Jean Ink, '41, is sporting a regi­
mental pin of the 176th Field Ar­
tillery of the Penna. National 
Guard. To add to the lists of form­
er Techites working at school: 
Margaret McCredie is secretary 
for the Chem Engineering Dept. 
Another Alpha Helen Ford is the 
newest edition to the Home Ec. 
Dept, faculty and is also a fresh­
man class sponsor.
Mildred Roth, ’40, graduate of 
the Social Work Dept., was mar- 
ried recently. ,
Mav End FencingO
Fencing lessons, now given on 
Friday afternoons at 12:30, will 
continue only if there is greater 
response from students. All men 
students are invited to learn fenc­
ing.
A limited number of advanced 
students in Friday classes will be 
accepted for Saturday classes.
Mr. Eyman has also announced 
that badminton and table tennis 
can be played in Thistle Hall from 
3:30 to 5 o’clock on Mondays, Wed­
nesdays and Fridays. If there ik 
sufficient demand, Saturday morn­
ing sessions will be scheduled.
No. 4. The problem of the thirsty
&opdh1
A horse situated at A desires to 
return to the barn B, stopping 
on his way at a point P to drink 
from a stream which flows in a 
straight line MN. If A and B are 
on the same side of MN, and if P 
is between M and N, show that 
the distance AP -|- PB which the 
horse has to walk is shortest when 
angle APM ~ angle BPN. This 
sounds like a problem in the cal­
culus; it can be done that way, but 
the required proof can be given 
much more easily by means of 
high school geometry.

a three-day period of silence. Dur­
ing this time bids will be submit­
ted to the rushees. The answer 
of the rushee MUST be in the 
Dean of Women’s office by 4:30 
Wednesday.
Rushing by a sorority member 
shall end at 5:30 P. M. each day 
during rushing season with the 
exception of the teas, formals, and 
buffet suppers. The formals will 
end promptly at 12 P. M. Non­
sorority girls may not assist in 
rushing. No rushee will be per­
mitted to be a guest either in the 
dormitories or in the home of a 
sorority girl.
Sorority girls may not have 
more than two consecutive lunch­
eon dates with a rushee. Sorority 
members are not permitted to pay 
for rushees’ meals or cokes.
All transfer students registered 
as Freshmen in M. M. C. C. may 
be rushed, but not initiated until 
after mid-semester grades have 
been issued.
To be eligible for membership 
a girl must be registered in due 
form as a regular day student, 
and must be scholastically eli­
gible.
A pledge who is either dropped 
by, or withdraws from a sorority 
is not allowed to be pledged by 
another sorority in the same col­
lege year.
Prospective pledges are advised 
to consult with the faculty advisor 
of each sorority in order that they 
may make the best decision. Fol­
lowing are the advisers: Alpha 
Theta Sigma—Mrs. Sharp; Gam­
ma Phi Sigma—Mrs. Blackmore, 
and Kappa Phi Delta—Mrs. Parisi.

He outflew the weather for 
Extra Speed
O In this "flying test tube,” above, "Tommy” 
Tomlinson pioneered the newest wonder of 
modern air travel —the Stratoliner. In rain, 
snow, hail, and sleet, this veteran flyer ‘‘‘asked 
for trouble” to prove that high-altitude planes 
can fly over most bad weather.
Skill, vision, perseverance...’'Tommy” 
Tomlinson has them all—in extra measure. 
Mildness, coolness, flavor—the qualities of a 
fine cigarette—he gets them all in his smoking, 
with an extra measure of each. He smokes 
slow-burning Camels.
He turned to Camels for 
Extra Mildness
• Twenty years — 7,000 hours of flying — more hours 
above 30,000 feet than any other flyer. 19 national rec­
ords for speed and endurance. That’s the flying log of 
"Tommy” Tomlinson (above). His smoking log would 
read: "I wanted more mildness in my cigarette. I 
changed to Camels and got what I wanted—extra mild­
ness with a grand flavor.”
Slower-burning Camels give you the natural mild­
ness and coolness of costlier tobaccos plus the freedom 
from excess heat and irritating qualities of too-fast 
burning. Try Camels. Get the extras—including extra 
smoking (see right).

Call for Issue No. 1
All students who have any ex­
tra copies of Issue No. 1 of xhe 
TARTAN are requested to bring 
them to the TARTAN office on the 
third floor of the Union, or place 
them in the TARTAN box, No. 
409, in the basement of Industries 
Building, as soon as possible, since 
copies are needed for the files.

ond and final installment of “How 
the Di\aft Affects Carnegie.”
5) Temporary exemption is pro­
vided for night school and gradu­
ate students whose employment in 
industry, agriculture, or other 
fields is found to be necessary to 
national safety, and interest. Any 
research worker whose work is 
essential to national defense or 
safety will also be released from 
service and training.
6) Faculty members in the Of­
ficers Reserve Corps are exempt 
under the Selective Service Act, 
but may be called for active duty 
as military needs justify. The Act 
prohibits blanket deferment of 
occupational groups; however, 
local boards have wide discre­
tionary powers to defer training 
for individual teachers. .
Each student will be assigned 
a number and will be subject to 
call for classification. He will re­
ceive a personal data sheet, one 
part of which will be for a record 
of his education and his attend­
ance at school during the current 
academic year. It is the opinion of 
certain prominent men that the 
Act will be liberally interpreted 
so as to carry out a policy of de­
ferring those students who are 
engaged in studies leading to a 
degree.

Someone in the dim, long for­
gotten past wrote a poem, which, 
although I have forgotten the 
lines, haunts me now and. then. 
Through my mind, in idle mo­
ments, occasionally flits a phrase 
or two . . . “though poppies bloom 
in Flander’s field” . . . “we shall 
not rest” . . . “lest we forget, lest 
we forget.”
It was an unimportant relic, a 
momento of a decade gone and 
almost forgotten. Those few words 
are part of a poem written about 
the World War I, 1914-18 AD. 
Could it be that we here in Am­
erica have forgotten too much 
about that last war? One of the 
archaic customs of that last war 
which seems to have fallen out of 
the minds of the students is the 
custom of observing Armistice 
day. Perhaps the day is not for­
gotten, but neglected in the school 
day fashion of dismissing school 
on an important holiday.
Perhaps, more significant is the 
creation of a new holiday. School 
will be dismissed, on October 16th 
in order that Tech’s eligible young 
men may register for the draft.

Choose any point P on MN and 
draw AP and PB. Now locate the 
point C which is the reflection of 
B In MN. This docs not mean that 
C is the reflection of the bam in 
the water, but that MN shall be 
the perpendicular bisector of line 
segment BC. Draw BC.
Since evidently AB = PC, the 
distance AP -|- PB which the horse 
walks is equal to AP 4- PC, re­
gardless of the position of P. The 
latter distance is least, however, 
when APC is a straight line, Then 
we have angle APM — angle CPN, 
and angle CPN = angle BPN, so 
that angle APM = angle BPN, as 
required. This is the law govern­
ing the reflection of a ray AP by 
a mirror MN, and explains why 
point C was called the reflection 
of B ( in MN).
This result is an example of 
what is called Fermat’s principle, 
namely, that a ray of light in 
passing from one point to another 
chooses the path which it can 
traverse in the least time. A bet- 
ter illustration is obtained when 
the problem is modified as follows:
Let A and B be on opposite sides 
of the stream, and suppose that 
instead of merely drinking at P, 
the horse there has slung over his 
back cans of Water, which are to 
be carried to the barn B. Sup­
pose further that the horse can 
run n times as fast unloaded as 
when loaded. Then the quickest 
route from A to B for the horse 
is the same as that which would 
be followed by a ray of light go­
ing from A to B, if line-segment 
AP were in air and PB in a me­
dium of refractive index n. The 
line APB, which is given by 
Snell’s Law of refraction, would 
not, of course, be a straight line; 
if it were, the distance would be 
a minimum, but not the time.
Psych, of Music 
Written by Prof
Continued from paflc 1 
Born in Austria, he came to the 
United States in 1900 and re­
ceived his doctor’s degree in psy­
chology from Iowa University in 
1921. In the same year, he came 
to Carnegie as a psychology pro­
fessor and has been there ever 
since, becoming head of the de­
partment in 1925. Although not 
a good musician, Dr. Schoen plays 
n squeaky viola which is one of 
his pet diversions, smokes a briar 
pipe, and walks with his dog. All 
of this goes to show that Lily's

By Ruth Brodie
Every now and again, someone 
comes out with a parody on Alice 
in Wonderland which lampoons 
the current political situation and 
becomes very famous, for no par­
ticular reason. Generally the piece 
ends up in a collection of essays 
in a freshman English book, label­
ed “Satire.”
If everyone else can do it, we 
don’t see why we can’t. We hold 
no hopes of any fame, or nation­
wide mention, but we are glad of 
a chance to let you know what we 
feel about the violent wind-bag- 
ing that’s going on right about 
now. So if Lewis Carroll doesn’t 
mind (and he can’t—he’s dead) 
and the editor doesn’t mind (and 
he can’t—he hasn’t anything else 
to put in this space) and if you 
don’t mind (and you can’t be­
cause you don’t have to read it, 
you know) we shall take our 
plunge through the looking glass. 
CRASH! ,•
Congressman Dumpty was sit­
ting, with his legs crossed like a 
Turk, on the top of a high wall. 
The front of the wall had, writ­
ten on it in large letters, “WAR.” 
Alice went around to the back, 
and there, in even larger letters, 
was written, “HYSTERIA.”
“War hysteria,” said Alice. “My 
goodness!”
Alice Warns Dumpty
“Don’t stand there chattering to 
yourself like that,” Congressman 
Dumpty said, looking at her for 
the first time. “If you’ve come 
to see me, state your business!” 
Alice couldn’t think of any par­
ticular business, and the sight of 
him perched up there on the wall 
made her quite giddy. “Don’t you 
think you’d be safer down on the 
ground?” she asked him. “That 
wall is so very narrow.”
“Of course I don’t think so!” 
Congressman Dumpty growled 
out. “Why, if ever I did fall off— 
which there’s no chance of—but 
if I did—” Here he pursed his lips, 
and looked so solemn and grand 
that Alice could hardly help 
laughing. “If I did fall,” he went 
on, “the King has promised me— 
ah, you may turn pale if you like! 
You didn’t think I was going to 
say that, did you? The King has 
promised me—with his very own 
mouth—to—to—”
“To send all his horses and all 
his men,” Alice interrupted, rath» 
er unwisely.
American Painting 
To Be Exhibited
Because of unsettled European 
conditions, the Department of Fine 
Arts of the Carnegie Institute will 
this year substitute an extensive 
collodion of American painting 
for the usual, famed annual “In­
ternationals,”.
The exhibition will bo held in 
the Fine Arts galleries, and is 
scheduled to open to the public 
on October 24. It will be one of 
the largest of all American paint­
ings ever assembled and presented 
to the public anywhere, accord­
ing to advance reports.
Both living and deceased ar­
tists will have their work repre­
sented in the large collection, 
which will include approximate­
ly 370 pieces.
The exhibition will remain open 
through December 15.

“Now I declare that’s too bad!” 
Congressman Dumpty cried,
breaking into a sudden passion. 
“You’ve been listening at doors— 
and behind trees—and down 
chimneys—or you couldn’t have 
known it!”
“I haven’t, indeed!” Alice said 
very gently. “It’s in Washington 
Merry-Go-Round almost every 
week. But all the King’s horses 
and all the King’s men can’t put 
Congressman Dumpty together 
again. So come down before you 
fall!”
“Shan’t,” said Congressman 
Dumpty crossly. “I’m all out of 
breath, and it’s your fault, you 
wretched child. Let’s go back to 
the last remark but one.”
“I’m afraid I can’t quite re­
member it,” Alice said.
Definition of Glory
“In that case we start afresh,” 
said Congressman Dumpty. “And 
„ it’s my turn to choose a subject. 
Next week everyone must register 
for army service. There’s glory for 
you.”
“I don’t know what you mean 
by ‘glory’,” Alice said.
Congressman Dumpty smiled 
contemptously. “Of course you 
don’t—till I tell you. I meant 
‘there’s a nice knock-down argu­
ment for you!”
“But ‘glory’ doesn’t mean fa nice 
knock-down argument’,” Alice ob­
jected.
“It does in this case. When I 
use the word,” Congressman 
Dumpty said, in rather a scorn­
ful tone, “it means just what I 
choose it to mean—neither more 
nor less.”
“The question is,” said Alice, 
“whether you can make words 
mean so many different things.” 
“The question is,” said Con­
gressman Dumpty, “Which is to 
be master—that’s all.” He was 
getting very excited. “Glory,” he 
shrieked, “can mean whatever I 
want it to. It can mean ‘doing 
what you’re told for no good rea­
son’ or it can mean ‘there’s your 
excuse for shooting people’ or it 
can mean ‘there now, vote for 
me.’ Anything at all, d’you hear?” 
Alice hurried away. Congress­
man Dumpty’s carelessness and 
his queer use of words frightened 
her. She thought she’d better go 
and warn the people that' he was 
in great danger of falling off the 
wall.

THISTLEDOWN
FISHER, CHURCH STILL MENDING

TARTAN SRATEGY BOARD
Football Again
This coming Thursday the Skibo football team, the Kiltie 
baud, two cheerleaders, and a smattering of student rooters set 
sail for Crusader land—that is Worcester, Mass., and Holy Cross 
College. With these sons, and a few stray daughters, will go the 
well wishes and high hopes of the remainder of the stay-at-home 
Tartan clan.
To my way of thinking the success of this campaign will rest
To my way of thinking the success of this campaign will rest, 
for the most part, on two things—a shoulder and a knee. By this 
knee. Those of you who sat through the Geneva game will more or 
Hess agree with me on the fact that the sad part of that supposed 
field day was the blocking of the Tech team. The non-blocking 
of our friends was due, I have been told, to the lack of experi­
enced ends, qualified in the art of mowing down the opposing 
tackles and backer-uppers. With Big Ted, known to all as Cletus, 
and Bob Church back in the lineup the chances of Carnegie com­
ing home with a victory are greatly enhanced. Their return to 
the lineup rest entirely upon the speed with which they recover 
from their inflictions. Need we say the sons and daughters of the 
old Institute are praying for a speedy recovery?
Varsity Trims Semi-Pros
Last Saturday morning, at 10 o’clock to be precise, the var­
sity football squad played the Trafford City Semi-propessional 
team. Either the visiting squad were a bimeh of inexperienced 
ball players or our boys have improved greatly since their last 
fracas, for they completely walloped their so-called .guests. The 
principal features of the Tecliites’ brand of ball were the decep­
tive plays used and their vicious blocking; Maybe they will be 
as potent next week in old NeAv England.
Intra-mural Football Begins
Bob Cowie, chief of the coming Intramural football cam­
paign, has announced the schedule for the coming season. The 
first three contests of the year will be run off on Thursday be- 
iween the Theta Xis and Electrical Engineers, the Beta Sigs and 
a squad known as the “Fleas,” and the DUs and Boss Hall. With 
twenty-two teams entered in this season’s competition, the Intra­
mural board feels certain that many men will participate in this 
athletic activity.
Frank to Speak
Tomorrow evening at 8:30 o’clock Frank Jordano will be 
actively engaged in a radio program sponsored and conducted 
by station KDKA. According to the present plans, several mem­
bers of the Pitt and Duquesne squads will be present at this meet­
ing. Should you by any chance finish your Calculus, Shorthand, 
English or any other form of amusement by this time Wednesday 
evening, tune in on your roommate’s radio and give Frank your 
telepathic support._______________________________________________

uous day of classes. It’s the place 
to meet all your friends, and has 
been a popular activity for many 
years.
Hockey is on the list for this 
fall as usual, and the practices 
start this week, so if you are in­
terested in a game with real sport - 
manship and teamwork plus a 
lot of good exerecise and fun, be 
sure to watch the boards for no­
tices of time and place for the first 
practices.
Tennis and volleyball are among 
the outdoor sports during this 
beautiful weather that we hope 
lasts forever. Some one told us 
we were scheduled to have eight 
weeks of Indian summer, and 
while we don’t like to believe some 
things, we might be persuaded to 
’take nice days like this.
The various events are coming 
thick and fast, and you’ll have to 
keep on your toes to keep up with 
them. Be sure to read the bulle­
tin boards everyday so that you 
won’t miss any of the events that 
you especially want to attend. To 
all those who enjoyed W. A. A.’s 
Barn Dances last year let me warn 
you to check October 25 on your 
calendars, for Harry McCormick

haystack frolic of the year.

sader to watch this year is Saba, 
180 pound back who beat out 
Whalen at the end of last season 
for a regular position.
Coach Joe Sheetketski’s team 
romped to victory in their initial 
contest with Providence College 
but lost their second round game 
to the powerful Louisiana State 
University team last Saturday. On 
the other hand, Tech has played 
only one game, that being with a 
mediocre team, Geneva.
The status of the Tech team is 
still very unsettled since both ends 
Ted Fisher and Bob Church are 
still out of action, the former hav­
ing a bad shoulder and Church 
having the worst charley-horso 
seen by trainer Bert Munhall in 
many years. It is possible that 
both may be able to play in the 
game but there is nothing definite 
on which to rely.
In addition to the team and 
band, two cheer leaders, several 
faculty members, and students are 
going on the special train that has 
been chartered. Anyone who is 
interested in going with this group 
should call Graduate Manager 
Overend and inquire for further 
particulars concerning the trip.

This coming Saturday, the Holy 
Cross “Crusaders” will be the host 
of our Carnegie Tech team at 
Worcester. Since this is the most 
distant away-game, the team is 
leaving Thursday night in order to 
get settled on the Holy Cross field.
The Kiltie band is also making the 
trip and will be on the same train 
as the football team.
Holy Cross will have an excel­

not be as strong as teams of re­

1939 lettermen have graduated.
Three of the regular backs return

Baseball Proposed For Tech
Group of Underclassmen Petition 
For Ball Team; Ask School Support
By George Tondorf
This Thursday the intramural 
touch football program gets un­
der way on the Cut. Among the 
innovations proposed for this sea­
son’s tourney is a new method of 
laying out the “gridirons” on 
which the games are to be played. 
The new set-up will consist of 
three fields 60 yards long and 30 
yards wide, with full ten yard end 
zones, unobstructed by trees or 
sidewalks as was the case in pre­
vious years. The three playing 
fields will run perpendicular to 
Forbes Street, a design which 
should give the maximum playing 
area available on the Cut.
The schedule for this season is 
to be run off as an elimination 
tournament, with 22 games going 
into action in the first bracket. 
Eventually the field will be nar­
rowed down to three contestants, 
and, if everything goes smoothly, 
a round-robin series will be held 
between these finalists to decide 
the championship. The entire pro­
gram is expected to be completed 
by the end of October, and, with 
a little co-operation from the 
weather, everything should click 
according to schedule.
Going into action at the opening 
whistle on Thursday will be six 
teams. Theta Xi tangles with the 
Electrical Engineers, while on a 
nearby field there will be a dorm- 
fraternity clash between the DUs
««mænmnættmmœwHmmmwmnmmnmmHmmwnmmammnmx
and the men of Welch Hall. The 
third encounter is between the 
Eeta Sigs and an all-Freshmen 
squad who call themselves “The 
Fleas.” We hope this team is not 
scratched at the last minute.
On Monday, October 14, the Cit- 
com Clan aggregation takes on the 
Tau Delts, while an inter-fra- 
ternity clash finds the SAEs slated 
to tackle the Phi Kaps in what 
should prove a plenty hot battle. 
The ATOs and Senior Mechanicals 
round out Monday’s schedule.
The Music Department, finalists 
of two seasons ago, meet the Betas 
next Tuesday, giving the Squirrel 
Hillers a stiff test in their open­
ing battle. Paired with the ever- 
dangerous PiKAs are the Junior 
Metallurgists, while the third 
game for the date finds the Sig­
ma Nu’s taking on McGill Hall.
On the following Thursday the 
last two games in the first bracket 
will be played when the Delts 
open their campaign in defense of 
their crown by meeting the men 
of Noble Scobell, and the Kappa 
Sigs take on the Boss Hall squad.
It has often been asked, “Why 
do we at Carnegie have no base­
ball team?” In many colleges this 
sport has reached major import­
ance in providing exercise and en­
joyment to great number of stu­
dents. Accepted as a national 
sport, entertaining to thousands of 
fans, baseball has yet to prove its 
value to the sudents at Carnegie 
Tech. If you will bear with 
me I will give you a few facts con­
cerning the case and leave the so­
lution in the balance.
The last baseball team sponsor­
ed by the Athletic Board at Car­
negie finished its season in the 
¦ spring of 1924. Since that time 
there has been no club accepted 
as representative ' of the college. 
During the sixteen years that fol­
lowed many independent groups of 
students interested in the sport 
organized small clubs to compete 
with local amateur teams. Two 
years ago a versatile club of school 
athletes developed a fair team 
which managed to win over local 
talent and even take a few outside 
trips. Last year a group of sixteen 
students organized a team, and un­
der the direction and advice of 
Dr. Neelley, played a three-game 
schedule. All equipment was sup­
plied by the individuals compet­
ing, and the transportation came 
from Dr. Neelley and other inter­
ested parties.
Practices were held on the Soc- 
cor Field at the convenience of the 
participants. Expenses per trip

Expects Fast 
Harrier Squad
Tech's fall harriers, the cross­
country team, have high hopes for 
their coming season. The basis 
for this feeling is, for the most 
part, the first trials on the four 
mile course through Schenley 
Park. The team has been practic­
ing for approximately two weeks 
and is in good shape to meet their 
first opponent, Slippery Rock State 
Teachers on the 17th of October. 
The following meets have been 
scheduled: Pitt “B“ team, West­
minster, and Bethany in that or­
der. Nick Teresi heads the squad 
of 20 men which include its aces 
Marein, Hardy, and a promising 
newcomer Margerum.
Considerable interest has been 
"shown in cross-country due to the 
fact that the freshman team is 
greatly increased over last year’s. 
Some of the outstanding plebes 
are Frank Pritchard who compet­
ed in the state finals; Ted Ma- 
coslco, and Jack Hirschfield.
averaged around fifty cents, and a 
return on a collection at one game 
netted an income, of $1.50.
This group has recently ap­
plied for school support in de­
veloping a team that will repre­
sent Carnegie Tech and will be 
sponsored by the school athletic 
ottlce. Although it may seem de­
plorable to discourage such a group 
of active students, the plan is ob­
viously impractical from the 
standpoint of school backing and 
intensive student participation. 
The entire athletic budget for 
the year having been. made out 
last February, such a program is 
absolutely impossible for this year. 
As to future support: School ac­
tivity unofficially closes around 
May 16 each year, giving way to 
final examination preparation. All 
you fans know that baseball is 
scarcely started at this date. And 
were there enough time for the 
activity, the financial burden 
would become heavy in view of 
the fact that the school sponsors a 
number of sports for the express 
purpose of reaching a maximum 
number of students.
Notice!
Coach Allen E! Risedorph issues 
a call for all boys interested in 
trying 'out for the freshman and 
varsity swimming squads. Both 
veterans of last year’s team and 
freshman are urged to turn out. 
The first practice will be held 
Monday, October 14, at 4:30 in the 
gym.

Rollinger Elected 
Industries’ Head
TO THE STUDENTS....
In 1939 there passed from this 
world a man who, during the years 
he spent here, erected for himself 
a memorial of love, kindness, 
friendship, and fairness in the 
hearts of every Carnegie Student. 
That man was Dr. Thomas S. 
Baker former president of Car­
negie Institute of Technology.
Members of the evening school 
of Carnegie were not quick to for­
get the many kindness bestowed 
on them by Dr. Baker, and short­
ly after his death the members of 
student council voted to set aside 
a sum to provide a memorial pla­
que. They knew, however, that 
they could not, regardless of the 
amount they alloted, erect a me­
morial which would truly rep­
resent the feelings of the evening 
students toward Dr. Baker. They 
knew that no plate of bronze, no 
matter how large or elaborately 
finished, could adequately repre­
sent the fullness and strength of 
this man’s character. They knew 
that, when they were giving the 
money for the plate that, they 
were just providing a symbol of 
material evidence to the world of 
the place Dr. Baker had in our 
hearts. For we need no me­
morial tablet to remind us of the 
services he rendered, and though 
the bronze may tarnish and crum­
ble with age, the things which Dr. 
Baker stood for and encourage in 
those about him will shine more 
brightly as the years go by.
You can’t put the heart of a 
man, nor the shining inspiration 
of a great mind into a piece of 
bronze, they can stay only in the 
living, human heart and there, in 
the hearts of those who knew him 
or the things he believed in, lies 
the true monument to Dr. Thomas 
Baker—a good man, a true friend, 
and a great educator.
Let's Dance
Nu Sigma Alpha 
Holds First Dance
Members of Nu Sigma Alpha, 
campus honorary activities fra­
ternity, will hold their annual 
Robert B. Leighou Scholarship 
Dance in Thistle Hall, Saturday 
evening, October 19th. The funds 
from this dance are being used to 
establish a scholarship fund for 
the evening students.
This will be the initial dance of 
the year, and to keep up the stand­
ard of firsts, the fraternity is pre­
senting a new band for its first 
appearance on the campus. It’s not 
the band’s first appearance on a 
college campus, however. They 
have been heard and well received 
on many college campuses in and 
around Pittsburgh.
You may secure tickets from 
any fraternity member or at the 
door for $1.00. By supporting the 
dance you are supporting your­
self. So come out and make the 
dance a success.
BETTER MADE FOR BETTER SMOKING

Last Saturday night students of 
the Vocationals Courses of the 
College of Enigneering met and 
elected their officers for the cur­
rent year. Amid smoke in abund­
ance, and in an aura of good fel­
lowship which is always felt at 
these Election Smokers, this group 
which is more familiarly known 
as Industries, enjoyed a fine enter­
tainment prior to casting their 
ballots for the ones they favor­
ed to guide the destiny of the 
school for the coming year. Fol­
lowing the balloting, they were 
served refreshments and then de­
parted for their homes, satisfied 
that they had made a good be­
ginning in selecting honorable and 
efficient persons to represent them.
The retiring officers. Nicholas 
Rollinger, Russel! Stroschein, Mar­
garet Scott and Joseph Gummo, 
planned an evening of fun which 
was very successful. With Mr. 
Lenhart as master of ceremonies, 
a vaudeville program was present­
ed which was received enthu­
siastically by the students. Among
.a string trio,

a tenor whose

followed by the singing of tradi­

Who’s that new man? Welcome 
him!
Say you’re glad he finally came; 
Tell him night school’s just a 
game
That all can play, and all can 
win!
There are about 200 newcomers 
on the evening school campus this 
year; men and women who are 
pretty much alone in this new 
chapter of their lives—and des­
perately in need of a friendly 
word. Old-timers might keep this 
in mind.
Did you keep in touch with 
the friends you made here on the 
campus, during the summer? If 
not, think of how many wonder­
ful opportunities you still have to 
make those friendships permanent. 
Edgar A. Guest wrote, “—and the 
joy of this world, when you’ve 
summed it all up, is found in the 
making of friends.”
William E. Pennsyl, Robert E. 
Thompson, and Frank J. Young. 
Married since we saw them here 
last, and just beginning to enjoy 
life, they’ll tell you. Bill was for­
merly Plaid Editor, Bob was Arts 
School President last year, and 
Tiny Young was last year’s Pres­
ident of the Engineers.' Romance 
and politics apparently go hand 
in hand.
The first engagement ring notic­
ed on the campus this year is that 
being worn by Thelma Hughes, 
whose handsome man is Ed Nuss, 
Editor of the Plaid. I’ll keep 
lookin’ around.
Almost everyone complains 
about the difficulty of finding a 
parking place on the campus, but 
no one seems to realize that by 
parking a litle closer together on 
the streets room for more cars 
would be provided. There is also 
a large parking lot just off Mar­
garet Morrison Street which is 
available to the students.
Due to a change in the location 
of the Post Office Department Eve­
ning Student Council Box is now 
listed as number 353. All mail
sent to Council or the Plaid should 
bear that address.
All students on the campus who 
are interested in working for an 
Insignia key should come out to 
work at the elections. There is a 
working period in the afternoon 
before the party at about 2 P. M. 
and one during the evening.
All new students will begin re­
ceiving the Plaid with this is­
sue. It always takes about two 
weeks to compile the new mail­
ing list, but the work has been 
completed.
Office Announces 
Draft Holiday
All students of the Carnegie In- 
Art School registration card, so be 
stitute of Technology, will receive 
a very unexpected and unusual 
vacation October 16. Never before 
in the history of Carnegie Tech 
has there been a Conscription 
Holiday. You all know what con­
scription is—It’s just the same as 
registration for night school. You 
stand in line, fill out forms, push 
and shove, but don’t worry—you 
won’t have to pay any tuition fee 
in’ the Army.__________________________
