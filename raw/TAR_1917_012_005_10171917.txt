TECD BOND SOLICITORS HAVING GREAT SUCCESS
The prospects of the Liberty Bond 
solicitors are encouraging. The fac­
ulty is responding to the best of its 
ability, and although comparatively 
few students seem to be so situated 
financially that they can bear the add­
ed burden of a dollar a week, yet the 
general attitude toward the loan is 
gratifying.
The boys are especially enthusias­
tic and are materializing the sugges­
tion made by the Tartan last, week 
and are going together in bodies to 
buy bonds.
Several fraternities have talked the 
matter'over and have decided to sub­
scribe' in the name of the fraternity. 
This banding together is a capital idea 
and shows not only deep-rooted pa­
triotism, but also admirable team 
work and healthy school spirit. \
One who does not have the moViey 
to invest in a bond, can do his best to 
persuade others thát have money to 
invest it to their own advantage for 
the cause of Uncle Sam.
CAMP FIRE SUPPER IS POSTPONED BYÍPLEBES
For Friday, October 12, the Plebe 
girls of M. M. C. S. had planned a 
camp fire supper. Girls were to ap­
pear in old clothes, bearing sandwich­
es and bacon or frankfurters to cook 
over the fire, and with Miss Coleman, 
were to “go back to nature” from 
4:30 to 7:30. However, as jaunts 
through damp woods are not the best
On Wednesday evening, October 10, 
Dean and Mrs. Bossange gave a re­
ception in honor of the Design Plebes. 
It was a most enjoyable evening, in­
cluding a fine display of home talent 
and dancing with music by the “Dram 
Jazz Band.”
In the receiving line with Dean 
and Mrs. Bossange were Director Ham- 
erschlag and Mr. Heinroth. The 
head of each department also aided in 
Introducing the new-coming students 
to other members of the faculty and 
the upper classmen.
The Plebes then proceeded to show
IN MUSIC HALL FOYER
For the first time in the history of 
the school the Men’s Dormitories As­
sociation has united with the Margar­
et Morrison and Design Dormitories, 
of Forbes street, Morewood and Fifth 
avenues for the purpose of establish­
ing a now tradition at Tech. In years 
past social activities among the Dorms 
have been of an independent rather 
than co-operative nature. This year, 
however, the annual ball is to be an 
inter-dorm affair, representing More- 
wood, Forbes and Fifth avenue halls, 
together with East, West and South 
Dormitories of Woodlawn avenue. A
The first team will.have a compara- 
| tively easy opponent In Ohio Univer­
sity. Although nothing very definite 
is known of this team, whatever in­
formation has filtered in tends to in­
dicate that the Ohio eleven is light 
and green, a characteristic of many 
teams this year. Last Saturday Woos­
ter defeated them 20 to 0 and wo 
should also show well against them. 
There has been a mistaken Impres­
sion with many of the student body 
that this Is the team with “Chick” 
Harley, All American Half, which 
won the Western Conference Cham­
pionship last fall. This is of course 
erroneous, the team being from Ohio 
University and not Ohio State.
Several injuries to the squad will 
provont Coach Steffen from presenting 
his strongest front. Early will be 
out of the game for at least one week 
with his Injured knee. MeFoator’s 
leg Is still bad, as are Williams' torn 
ligaments. “Rod” Nemsor Is also suf­
fering from a severe thigh bruise.

COLLEGE NIGHT WELL ATTENDED AT SCHENLEY
The usual Tech spirit was shown 
at the Schenley Theatre last Saturday 
nlglit, which was Tech and Westmin­
ster night at that theater. An unusually 
large attendance of Tech men, and the 
enthusiasm shown by the actors, serv­
ed to make the occasion a great suc­
cess. The auditorium was decorated 
with Tech .and Westminster banners, 
and the chorus carried them, too. The 
leading lady wore the Tech colors In 
the first act, and was rewarded with 
an Angora cat, which didn’t seem to 
take very well to the life behind the 
footlights, however.
The band was present, and cheering 
and singing by the students and actors 
left no one in doubt as to whether 
or not the place “belonged to Tech” 
on that occasion.

M. M. C. S. HAS FIRST STUDENTS ASSEMBLY
On Wednesday, October 10, M. M. 
G. S. held their first Student Assem­
bly of the season. Helen Sonn, Presi­
dent of the Student Self Government 
Association presided. The heads of 
the various school organizations ex­
plained their purpose and work for 
the benefit of the new students. An­
na McCandless represented the Red 
Cross ; Rachel Beatty, the Guild ; and 
Ida Richter, the Athletic Association. 
In the absence of Mary Ege, Helen 
Clark spoke about the Dramatic As­
sociation.
The Woman’s Song and Dear Old 
Carnegie were sung. There is noth­
ing like a Student Assembly to pro­
mote' School Spirit. Let's have them 
oftener.

ed chief choorloador for Iho coming

Gearhart, and Merrill and from tho 
throe schools Adams, Kelsor, and Ar­
mor. The vote was made without con­
sultation, but In talking tho matter 
over afterwards tho committee felt 
that Stark had done tho most uniform­
ly good work. Tho decision botwoon 
tho three candidates was a closo one, 
but it seemod that tho uniformity of 
tho successful candidate’s work had 
been In his favor.
NEW ENGLAND CLUB TO HOLD FIRST MEETING
The New England Club will hold its 
inaugural smoker of the year next 
Wednesday, October 24, at 8:30 at the 
home of Dr. Harris on Woodlawn ave­
nue next to the Gym. The member­
ship has been largely depleted through 
the war and it is hoped that a large 
number of incoming men will be out 
to bring the organization up to its 
former membership standard.
The program will consist of short 
talks by members of the faculty from 
New England. Music, smokes and 
eats. There will also be a short busi­
ness meeting for the election of new 
officers.
No one can give an excuse for not 
appearing, as there will be time before 
8:30 and also after the meeting to 
study. Get out and show some of 
that Minute-Man Pep!
A SUCCESSFUL END RUN BY QUARTERBACK BLOOM
. m -
The Tech football team, crippled 
and fighting gamely, defeated the 
Westminster eleven on Tech Field in 
the first home game of the season. 
The game was well attended by .an en­
thusiastic crowd of supporters who 
came out to catch a first glimpse of 
the new team in action and lend their 
lung* to assisting In the selection, of 
a school cheer leader. They seemed 
to instil’ the spirit of former years in 
the men and they manifested a mark­
ed improvement over tliolr work in 
tho Army game. Coach Steffen stated 
before the game that it marked the 
critical stage of the season and that 
the results would determine largely 
whether the team would be a loser 
or winner. The results of the game 
are therefore particularly gratifying, 
in spite of the fact that in some de­
partments of the game—tackling, for 
example—the team did not show up 
especially.' well.
The entire backfield . showed par­
ticularly well. Early was forced to 
retire during the first quartor on ac­
count of his injured knee. Alexander 
who substituted for him showed woll 
in skirting the ends and throwing 
passes effectively. His tackle of Ash­
ton 011 the Tech 12-yard line prevent­
ed what appeared to be a certain 
Westminster touchdown. Bloom han­
dled the Loam woll and in certain re­
spects conducted himself like "Sunny” 
Kestner who he resembles In build. 
Glim at full-back was a consistent 
ground gainer through the lino. Lynn’s 
kicking was a groat Improvement ov­
er Iho punting In the Wost Poli^t gamo. 
Ills punts averaged fairly woll in 
length and ho neatly drop klclcod goal 
from tlib 22-yard lino In the second 
quarter. Earl's Icnoe Impeded his 
playing; but ho was rosponslhlo for 
tho only touchdown.
The work 011 tho lino was also im­
proved. In tho last quarter tho line 
held Westminster like a stono wall 
011 tho Tech !l-yard lino. Jonos hold 
his man woll, broke through.on one 
ooca'slon to block Dunn's punt and 
rocovored a fumble. Nomsor loft tho 
gamo early because of an lnjurod leg. 
Wagner and Fox, both of whom are 
now, played steadily. Vot Williams 
gamely stuck the game out In spite 
of tho torn ligaments in his log. Grotz- 
lor playod a good gamo 011 I.Jio dofonso, 
but his passing was ragged in spots.
Westminster came on the Hold at 
2:55 and Tech followed fivo minutes 
later. Both teams ran through signals 
and tried a few kicks.
First Quarter.
Dunn kicked off for Westminster 
to Early who returned tho ball twen­
ty-four yards to the 30-yard line. Early 
made eight around left end; Ginn 
made three at guard. Early then car­
ried tho ball through right taclclo for 
the first down on the 43-yard line. 
Lynn gained two yards at center and 
Early went around right end for five 
yards, but Tech was penalized for be­
ing off side. Early was held for no 
gain at right end. Lynn punted to 
We Inn an on the'Westminster, 25-yard 
line, and Welrman brought the ball 
back five yards.
Armstrong made a yard in the line 
and Weirman was good for five at 
right guard. Dunn was held without 
gain at left end. Dunn’s punt was high

SING THE ALMA MATER.
Words by Charles J. Taylor 
Here where spangled wildernesses 
Robed the fountains of the west, 
Where the savage strife and stresses 
Brought the settlers’ crimson quest; 
Land of legend, glory, graces,
Gypsy side and toiling shore,
'Mid thy hilltops Alma Mater 
Stand enthroned forevermore,
Hail Carnegie! Alma Mater—
Stands enthroned forevermore!
Here was heard the musket's rattle, 
Round us rolled the thralling drum, 
All is hushed, no more they startle. 
Low we hear sweet labor's hum. 
Art and science rule our battle,
In their pathway honor lies,
Hail Carnegie! Alma Mater—
Show the way that truth may rise! 
Hail Carnegie! Alma Mater—
Show the way that truth may rise!
Show the way, arouse, awaken,
Bear aloft thy beacon bright;
That our minds he ever taken 
Unto learning, unto light.
Stand in daytime’s storm unshaken, 
Guide through storms, of deepest 
night!
Hail Carnegie! Alma Mater—
Stand for progress, peace, and 
right!
Hail Carnegie! Alma Mater—
Stand for progress, peace, and

DORMITORIES NOMME OFFICERS FOR THE YEAR
Whatever may have been your personal impression of Tech 
Night as a whole, there was one incident which you, and doubtless 
everyone else, could not let pass without notice. Sometimes we make 
mistakes which arc not noticeable; sometimes we have faults which 
arc not glaring; but this was both noticeable and glaring.
The students of Tech do not know their Alma Mater!
So long as the words of the song were on the screen at the Schen- 
Icy Theater that night, there was some attempt on the part of the men 
and women present to sing; but as soon as the words were removed, 
the sudden silence was so obvious as to be absoutely cutting.
The fault, no doubt, lies as much with the school authorities and 
the heads of the student Assemblies as with the student body. The 
Alma Mater is almost never sung, when in reality it ought to be used 
just as often as our other school songs. But the average Tech man 
cannot shift off all responsibility from himself because lie does not 
hear the song often enough. He should learn it, and, for that pur­
pose, it is given in the accompanying column of The Tartan; then he 
should sec to it that bis school docs make use of its Alma Mater.
The lack of the proper school spirit has been apparent this year 
in cheering as well as in singing. School cheers are entirely useless 
unless every man present does his share, and all do it together. It is 
essential that the cheerleader be supported in all his efforts, just as 
readily as the team is supported.
A WORD TO THE WISE.
The Red Cross hospital sewing is progressing famously since 
compulsory setting-up exercises have been instituted. Those girls 
not permitted by the doctor to participate in gymnasium work, sew 
or Unit for the Red dross iluriuv these two hours a week. Three 
holts of material were cut up during the past week for hospital shirts 
and pajamas.
The second shipment of wool is on the road, but Margaret Mor­
rison still needs more money to buy enough yarn to supply all of the 
l*irls who are willing to knit. The boys are slowly beginning to re- 
(.piMid to the big sign on the campus since the first set of knitted 
111i11¦ ¦ * v.ss supplied to a Teehite leaving for France.
V OL appeal for money is not a mere whim, a bit of talk on the 
part " the girls. When their necessity was mentioned editorially 
by The Tartan several weeks ago, we received a letter from the secre­
tary of the unit suggesting that our appeal had not been strong 
enough. Was she correct in saying that the men of Tech need more 
than a hint in getting together to help the women? A word to the 
wise I
ASSEMBLY REFORM IN M. M. O. S. 
WHY NOT ELSEWHERE ALSO?
Through thoughtlessness on the part of the M. M. C. S. girls, the 
standard of assembly order fell appreciably during the past year. 
Entrance of outside speakers, to say nothing of our own faculty 
speakers, went unrecognized. Speeches-were interrupted by a con­
stant stream of late-eomers, and noise in the halls’ betrayed truants.
The girls can easily see how this lack of courtesy embarrasses 
the assembly chairman, who is responsible for the program. Not only 
that, but the visitor forms his opinion and carries away an unfair im­
pression of the spirit of M. M. C. S.
Since our school is governed by its students, better order must 
come about through an individual feeling of responsibility. To be 
responsible for yourself, and your neighbor, if she should forget, 
would make the loud warning, “Sh-sh” from some upper classman or 
student government officer unnecessary.
When we realize a courteous attitude in assembly, we can 
proudly compete with any student organization.
LIBERTY LOAN IN INDUSTRIES.
Aftor our editorial of last, week, The Tartan cannot help but feel 
' elated that the idea of concerted action in regard to the Liberty Loan 
has found such instant favor. Whether or not The Tartan actually 
inspired,the action of the Industries Assembly in instituting its Lib­
erty Loan Memorial is immaterial; the important fact is that the same 
plan which we supported appeared attractive to them also.
Their action is commendable to the highest degree. It enables 
the students who could not possibly own a bond themselves to par­
ticipate in the response to the command, “Buy a Bond!”

INDUSTRIES GRADUATE SENDS NEWS FROM CAMf
The 'following letter ^vas received 
by Mr. Pfouts, of Industries, from one 
of last year’s graduates, who is now 
at Camp Lee in Virginia:
Dear Mr. Pfoute:
This army life is the life for me. 
Just imagine me getting up at 5:15 
every morning after spending a cool, 
very cool night’s sleep.
After we get up we go to the mess 
hall for our palate-tickling meals. 
The meals usually consist of "a po­
tato” some variety of animal flesh, 
and some of that delicious army 
punk. In the morning and evening 
'hey pass a pound of coffee over a 
boiler of water, and in this way w'e1 
got delicious Java twice a day. At 
110011 we get all the water we can. 
drink. Anyone you hear kicking about 
tin* meals at -the beanery, just gently 
tap him on the dome for me, for if 
we got a meal down here like they 
sorve at the beanery we would think 
wo were in heaven, or else think fhat 
President Wilson was going t.o have 
up with us.
Wo wore examined and given our 
»hot in the arm, Saturday, and believe 
me I fool it today. I feel like a poi­
soned pup, gbt.tiie feeling that puts 
one in a mood that he doesn't care 
whether they are dead or alive.
I have boon placed in the suicide 
squad (Machine Gun Co) and although 
I know many fellows here, I would 
rather bo among Tech men.
Trusting that 1 may hoar from you 
rogulnr, I remain
Sincerely yuors,
V. it. BRENNAN.

Thistle Board Loses Manj’ 
Members During Summer
The Thistle Board held its first 
meeting of the year in the M. M. C. S. 
last Thursday afternoon. Many mem­
bers of the board, including Business 
Manager Crosby, have been lost over 
the summer, and consequently there 
are many vacancies which are to be 
filled by election this week before the 
next meeting on Friday.
The board as organized at present 
has Pafenbach at its head as Editor- 
in-Cluef. Unfortunately, Pafenbach is 
about to leave school; so that that of­
fice will also probably have to be.filled 
in the near future by the Science 
Junior Class. As for the rest of the 
organization, Brandin is Sales Mana­
ger, and Wheeler, Treasurer.
COLLEGE NIGHT TO BE CELEBRATED AT NIXON
Over a hundred girls from M. M. C. 
S. and many students from the other

latest addition to those who will at­
tend is the whole Junior Mechanical 
action who expect to occupy the first 
"ow in the gallery.
The girls from M. M. C. S. are leani­
ng their own school songs and cheers 
•o that they may compete with the 
other girls of the city.
A meeting of all the dormitories was 
held last Thursday night in the West 
club room for the purpose of voting 
on the revised constitution and for the

year’s circulation manager of The Tar­
tan, presided. Dr. Esquerre was pres­
ent to straighten out all doubtful 
phases of the situation. The revised 
constitution, copies of which are1 
posted in all the dorms, was accepted 
as read. A temporary social commit­
tee comprised of Gellin and Civilett 
was voted into office. The following 
nominations were made for the vari­

MISS DEMORIST SPEAKS AT STUDENTS ASSEMBLY
Wednesday, at the regular weekly 
meeting of the students of Industries, 
Miss Demorest addressed the assem­
bly on “America in the Great War.” 
Miss Demorest is assistant professor 
of history in the Margaret Morrison 
School and by the address proved her­
self to be a close student of the great 
modern catastrophy.
Among other points, Miss Demorest 
laid great stress on "America and fler 
Ideal,” not only in this war, but in 
every grefyt national emergency which 
sho has faced. • Democracy has stood 
forth at all times and now it will con­
quer in the last great stand against 
imperialism, not only through the ma­
terial forces of men, ships, guns and 
money, but also through the great 
moral force and the principles of hu­
manity which America has and al­
ways will champion.
Miss Demorest, through her elo­
quence and delivery, will be long re­
membered among the students of In­
dustries.
/iliKICUITURE EXPERTS USING TECH LABORATORY
Two experts from the United States 
Department of Agriculture are con­
ducting experiments in the food lab­
oratory at M. M. C. S. to ascertain 
the amount of. culinary waste in 
peaches shipped from some distance. 
The peaches are being shipped here 
from the shores of Lake Ontario. The 
fruit is peeled, the stones and all de­
cayed parts cut out. This waste as 
well as the edible part of the peach 
is weighed. The peaches are also 
graded as to use. The purpose of the 
experiment is two fold: to ascertain 
the amount of culinary waste and to 
learn what, effect different methods of 
harvesting have on the keeping qual­
ity.
The government also has men in the 
city who are working on the best 
methods of transportation of peaches.
VARSITY CLAN PLANS 
BANQUET FOR MEMBERS
Campaign Renewed to Secure 
All Letter Men
The Varsity Clan is making a re­
newed campaign for an increased mem­
bership. Of some three hundred let­
ter men only a hundred have paid their 
initiation fee as members of the clan. 
The advantages from such member­
ship are obvious,—an influence in 
athletic affairs, attendance at the 
clan’s banquet,'receipt of The Tartan, 
and special favors in regard to re­
served seats at home games.
To promote the campaign President 
Overend held a conference with Sec­
retary Gearhart yesterday morning. A 
committee was appointed to go ahead 
with plans for the clan's banquet on 
the evening of the Pitt game. The 
banquet will be from seven to nine 
that evening, giving time for the men 
to come to the annual smoker after­
wards. It will be free for members 
of the clan, and for members of the 
present varsity teams, each team hav- 
’ng a table. Other students may at­
tend by paying the regulation assess­
ment.
RESULTS OF DESIGN ELECTION OF OFFICERS
The election of officers of the De­
sign School which was held in the 
Dean's office from twelve to two Fri­
day, October 12, resulted as follows:
First Vice. President—No majority.
Second Vice President—No majority.
Secretary—Alex Sharove.
Tyler—T. R. Hinkley.
Historian—H. D. Watterson.

J. P. Davies.
Junior Activities Representative- 
R. R. Willoughby.
PUPPET WILL NOT BE PUBLISHED THIS YEAR
Among the other little every day 
tragedies that occur around Tech, 
there will be the fate of Puppet. For 
two years, more or less, the Carnegie 
humorous quarterly spread joy or 
shocks around the school and this part 
of Pittsburgh in general. It may have 
been good while it lasted, but it 
couldn’t last this year. Maybe some 
of you already guessed that. Any­
how, Puppet developed internal troub 
les of its own. Among other things, 
there are just two of last year’s staff 
back in school, and mainly because 
they were on last year’s staff they 
are hesitant about attempting to han­
dle a very big proposition this year. 
They conferred with Dean Bossange, 
Dr. Esquerre, and Mr. Gearhart, and 
at each conference the future of Pup­
pet became more funeral. Their de­
cision is that there will be no more 
Puppet. Anybody may appeal to some 
higher court .from this decision; • the 
two late editors wish some person or 
persons would try to prove that Pup­
pet can go on, but the administration 
officials and late editors do not see 
how it can be done.

of this school. McSeidel of the upper 
class acted as judge.
Mr. Knight was charged with fail­
ure to wear the regulation cap and 
general insolence. Messrs Thomas 
Mident and Cargo with failure to wear 
caps. Mr. Cargo, a night design man 
of last year, was declared exempt 
from the ruling. Mr. Mident wax put 
on probation, while Knight and Thom­
as were recommended for a hair cut 
Thanks to the leniency of Judge Sei 
del, the last two offenders were given 
a special warning and the sentence 
suspended.

treat. Director Leote of the Carnegh* 
Library, who is better known to the 
upper-classmen as Dean Leete, spok*> 
very interestingly on the duties of his 
new position. He cited a few humor­
ous incidents and proved that the li­

Because of the growing misuse of 
the Red Cross emblem commercially 
the American Red Cross has just is­
sued a new warning to those who may 
be violating the law regarding it. 
While much of this misuse of the em­
blem is unintentional and through ex­
cessive zeal, the national Red Cross 
can no longer acquiesce In these viola­
tions, many of which have been and 
are of a serious nature.
Under the statute the Red Cross em­
blem can only be used by authority. It 
cannot be used In the manufacture or 
sale of Red Cross buttons or pins ex­
cept upon such authorization. Many 
novelty manufacturing houses and 
stores, taking advantage of the great 
Increase of popular Interest in the Red 
Cross, as well as the growth in mem­
bership to nearly 4,000,000, have put on 
sale large quantities of Red Cross 
pins, post cards and devices. An equal­
ly common abuse has been on the cov­
ers of patriotic songs and popular 
magazines.
It is the feeling of Red Cross officials 
that the Red Cross emblem should be 
regarded much as the flag is regarded. 
Under the law and the Geneva Interna­
tional agreement the emblem Is set 
apart for the work of relief and mercy. 
It should not be used in any way to de­
tract from that high office. Its use to 
stimulate the sale of magazines, songs, 
post cards or other articles under the 
guise of patriotism, therefore, should 
•not be regarded as proper.
Provisions of the law are as follows:
“It shall be unlawful for any person, 
corporation or association other than 
the American National Red Cross and 
jits duly authorized employees and 
agents and the army and navy sanitary 
•and hospital authorities of the United 
¦States, for the purpose of trade or as 
ian advertisement to Induce the sale of 
¡any article whatsoever or for any busi­
ness or charitable purpose, to use with­
in the territory of the United States 
and its exterior possessions the emblem 
of the Greek red cross on a white 
ground, or any sign or insignia made 
¡or colored in imitation thereof, or of 
!the words ‘Red Cross’ or any combina­
tion of these words.”

THE TAXTANWednesday, October 17, 1917
(luced their "stunt” next. It was a 
two-act play, entitled "The Purloined 
Toothpick,” a romance of the Bul­
garian '’courts iii which the Imperial 
toothpick disappears much to the 
King’s chagrin. The search begins. 
Between acts one and two the Im­
perial Jazz Symphony emitted a few 
heart-rending strains. In the second 
act the count and the princess appear. 
The princess plotting against the life 
of the king has purloined the tooth­
pick, which turns out to be no more 
nor less than a Beanery fork. The 
king disguised as a tree recovers the 
fork from the princess, but the tragic 
end was that the Beanery official 
turned up at the crucial moment and 
demanded the hardware.
Charles Stotz enters as a wander­
ing tramp from a life of travel, and 
condescends to relate some of his 
divers and thrilling experiences “to 
the boys and girls of Tech” and pre­
sents with guitar accompaniment the 
most highly valued of the Bulgarian 
folk songs, such as “I knew she 
wouldn’t do,” and "She laid in the 
hammock and played her guitar;”
He then introduced the Imperial 
Court Players of Bulgaria in a most 
tender little romance. The company 
had met Mr. Beatty somewhere in Bul­
garia and borrowed his Elizabethan 
costumes. They were unfortunate in 
not having enough to go around, but 
that only aided the effect—the mis­
fits were startling, especially the king’s 
pea-green tights. Count Bipins was a 
crarming specimen of the court and 
Silling as the princess reminded one 
of a Shakespearean handmaid. Rank 
as interpreter emitted sonorous notes 
from the depths of his soul. Harry 
Obert. was one of the king’s supporters 
and almost failed him.
Hinlcly of the Jazz trio in throes 
of jealousy smote Rank most mightily 
with a huge cudgel, thereby ending 
the play rudely but effectively.
The “hit” of the evening was scored 
by the Plebes of the Drama Depart­
ment. who staged a tragedy in one 
act entitled, “The Interview.” The 
persons represented were Dean BO'- 
sange, impersonated by Nazareno La 
Marca; Mrs. I. M. Anxious, by Min- 
nette Buddeclce, and Miss Overly 
Anxious, by Martha' Klieves.
The sketch opens with the Dean 
seated at his desk. Mrs. I. M. Anxiou * 
brings her daughter Overly whom sir; 
introduces as a very good act/re . 
She announces that Overly played a 
small part in a high school play, which 
she made famous by her gesticulation 
and intonation of the word "useless.”
I. M. then and there decided that it 
would be an imposition to the public 
not: to put the daughter on the stag'\ 
The Dean tries repeatedly to question 
Overly, but is continually interrupted 
by I. M., insists that Overly recite. 
“The Echo” is selected. When the 
Dean suggests that she knows "Tlr* 
Merchant of Venice,” I. M. say ¡, 
“Yes, we deal at all the large depart­
ment; stores.” The Dean then givi*< 
Overly Portia’s mercy speech to rend 
She breaks into tears and the mother 
indignant says, "Such speeches av 
unworthy. 1 will take Overly to a 
school where her efforts .will be/ap-, 
predated.”
Mr. La Marca. Speared to excellent 
advantage as the Dean, and Miss Bud- 
decke succeeded in making Mrs. 1. 
M. Anxious a very human character. 
Her prMte in her daughter and her ef­
forts to "show her off to advantage’.’ 
were very realistically done. Miss 
Reives’ rendition of "The splendor 
falls on castle wall” etc., showed great 
dramatic or rather gymnastic ability, 
and despite the ending of the play, 
she certainly is a valued addition to 
the class of "Dramatic Culture.”
The last sketch was Janies Mont­
gomery Flagg’s "His wife knew about 
it.” The characters were Bill Drake, 
impersonated by Luther Roy; Dolly 
Drake, impersonated by Miss Pier- 
pont; tlie Cook, impersonated by Miss 
Goff; Larimore, impersonated'by Wil­
lard Perkins; Wycoff, impersonated 
by W. O. O’Rourke; the Waiter, im­
personated by B. II. Dierks.
The scene is a. French restaurant: 
Bill Drake is seated at a table with 
a charming young lady, who latei’ 
turns out to be the cook.
Larimore and Wycoff. wonder who 
the woman is and they discuss var­
ious solutions to the problem. The 
wife appears with a message for her 
husband. Wycoff and Larimore try 
to prevent her seeing Drake. She 
finally sees him and the explanation 
follows. Drake in order to keep the 
cook, dines with her in town every 
Saturday evening. The play was 
quite well done.
One of the most conspicious and 
best features of the. evening was the 
Dram Jazz band, wrbich seemed able 
to extract music from things mostly 
used for other purposes.
David Gaither, who acted as master 
of ceremonies, was also a member of 
the Jazz band, playing an instrument 
of his invention, consisting of a row 
of bottles, frying pans, etc, or in other 
words the “Jazz.” Trabert played 
the violin, Muller, the piano, and 
Buchanan the drums. This famous 
band furnished music for the dance, 
which followed. Refreshments in the 
form of coffee and ¦wafers were serv­

bers of the band also had good make­
ups. Miss Dorothy Manor, who play­
ed the violin, was dressed as a poor 
young musician who felt the high 
cost of living so greatly that she could 
not. afford to wear a pair ..of shoes 
and stockings which matched. Miss 
ljJshelmann as a decrepit old woman, 
played the harmonium. Mr. George 
Wilkins, the only male member of tlio 
crowd, showed in his make-up the ef­
fect. of Loo much wine, women and 
song. Miss Roberts, as a “nigger” 
drummer, also had a good m race-up. 
Between concerts, Miss Briggs, im­
personated a classic dancer dressed 
in a long white garment.
Alexander Buchanan then came 
forth as Buclianovitz, the great Rus­
sian dancer, and gave a fine exhibi­
tion of balancing on a sliding carpet. 
He was assisted by James Church, 
who worked the' lights—putting them
