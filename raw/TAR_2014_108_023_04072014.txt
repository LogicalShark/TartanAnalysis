Glasner, Ray elected as SBP, SBVP
BRENT HEARD
Contributing Editor
Student government elec-
tion results were released on 
Monday, March 31. Junior 
electrical and computer engi-
neering and business admin-
istration double major Ian 
Glasner was elected student 
body president (SBP) and ju-
nior biological sciences ma-
jor Shalini Ray was elected 
student body vice president 
(SBVP). 
Additionally, the student 
body voted sophomore elec-
trical and computer engi-
neering major Divya Kothan-
dapani as student body vice 
president for ?nance (SBVPF) 
and sophomore computer sci-
ence and math double major 
Jack Michalak as student 
body vice president for orga-
nizations (SBVPO).
Student voter turnout 
showed a slight increase over 
previous years, with 17.9 per-
cent of total students voting. 
32.21 percent of undergradu-
ate students cast their votes, 
as compared to 30 percent in 
2013. Graduate student vot-
ing decreased, however, with 
only 3.32 percent of Carnegie 
Mellon’s graduate population 
voting, a small drop from the 
3.94 percent who voted in 
2013.
Glasner and Ray ran their 
SBP/SBVP ticket on a plat-
form of getting students more 
involved in their representa-
tion, promising to push for a 
number of reforms including 
restructuring dining plans to 
be more desirable to upper-
classmen and changing the 
school’s dorm alcohol policy 
to one which uses an internal 
system rather than one which 
involves the police, similar 
to the system currently in 
place at all eight Ivy League 
universities.
While not designating 
one policy as a top priority, 
Glasner said, “I’m very pas-
sionate about dining, and I’m 
also passionate about looking 
into the current alcohol policy 
on campus.”
“I think every change that I 
want to happen is going to be 
a year’s process, if not more,” 
Glasner continued. “So, get-
ting them all started at the be-
ginning of the year is going to 
mean weekly meetings with 
administration, bringing stu-
dents on board, and getting 
student feedback.”
Kothandapani campaigned 
on her experience serving on 
the university’s Joint Funding 
Committee (JFC) and prom-
ised to provide an easier-to-
understand budget process 
for student organizations.
Kothandapani said that 
“starting the application for 
next year’s JFC reps” would 
be her ?rst task when taking 
of?ce, and spoke about the 
number of votes she received, 
saying “it feels really good to 
have that support.”
Michalak built his cam-
paign around a set of reforms 
beginning with the organi-
zation recognition process, 
setting up a better system 
for student organizations to 
receive advice, and creating  
an improved system for room 
registration. Michalak also 
spoke of supporting broader 
campus reforms, such as ex-
panding the Amnesty Interna-
tional policy for alcohol to in-
clude drugs, and the prospect 
of establishing gender-neutral 
restrooms.
Michalak recalled the 
wishes of current SBVPO 
Corrine Rockoff. “She really 
wanted someone with the 
experience to take over the

Staffwriter
Students, faculty and staff 
jostled to get into Rashid Au-
ditorium to hear a talk by Sal 
Khan, founder of Khan Acad-
emy, Thursday morning. Ten 
minutes before the speech 
was scheduled to begin, the 
250-seat auditorium was 
standing room only — it was 
so crowded that the Univer-
sity Police closed the doors, 
barring additional spectators 
to prevent a ?re hazard.
Determined to see Khan, 
many students looked in 
through the window instead, 
like Robert Buarque de Mace-
do, a sophomore physics ma-
jor, who said that seeing Khan 
was amazing after hearing his 
voice so often in Khan Acad-
emy videos. “Khan helped 
me through high school,” 
Macedo said, although he 
had never met Khan nor seen 
him in person before. Aatish 
Nayak, a ?rst-year electrical 
and computer engineering 
major, added, “It’s crazy that 
[Khan] makes his own videos; 
it shows his dedication.”
Khan’s videos, which now 
form the basis of the website 
Khan Academy, have become 
enormously popular, with 
more than 10 million students 
viewing them each month.
Khan is, in many ways, an 
accidental educator. While 
working for a hedge fund, his 
family was visiting and he 
learned that his cousin Nadia 
was struggling in math. “I told 
her, ‘Look, I think you’re fully 
capable of this … if you’re 
willing to … we’ll work on the 
phone everyday,’ ” Khan said. 
Starting in August 2004, Khan 
worked with her on her math 
skills while he lived in Boston 
and she lived in New Orleans.
Khan’s belief that everyone 
can succeed if given the right 
education drives much of his 
work.
Nadia rapidly progressed 
in her school from “slow” 
math to an advanced track 
— her success inspired other 
family members to ask Khan 
for tutoring help. Khan, who 
has a background in software, 
started writing quizzes for 
his students to take and was 
mentoring as many as 10 fam-
ily members at once. A friend 
recommended to Khan that 
he prerecord his lessons and 
load them onto YouTube so he 
could scale to more students.
Khan was apprehensive 
at ?rst, saying, “That’s a hor-
rible idea. YouTube is for cats 
playing the piano.” But after 
a month of using the YouTube 
videos, his cousins told him 
that they preferred the videos 
over the video chats.
“It soon became clear that 
people who were not my cous-
ins were watching the videos. 
Most of the comments were 
just ‘Thank you’ which is a 
pretty big deal. I don’t know

When Carnegie Mellon 
released its Fall 2014 course 
listings last Sunday, some 
Carnegie Mellon students 
noticed that something was 
missing — 70-419 Entre-
preneurship Practicum: Ap-
prentice, a course taught by 
Robert F. Culbertson, adjunct 
assistant professor of entre-
preneurship in the Tepper 
School of Business.
Culbertson’s course was 
an outlier in Tepper’s entre-
preneurship offerings, and 
gave students hands-on les-
sons in entrepreneurship. 
According to Michael Mc-
Dermott, a junior materi-
als science and engineering 
and biomedical engineering 
double major and a teaching 
assistant for the course, the 
course was broken down into 
four to ?ve apprenticeships, 
which are different projects, 
usually in groups and ranging 
from two weeks to a month 
long, that students complete.
The ?rst one, McDermott 
said, was always karaoke. 
Students had to break into 
groups and sing in front of 
the class, “because most of 
us have terrible voices, and 
just look and sound terrible 
in front of the class when 
we’re doing it,” McDermott 
said. “That primes you to 
work with other people and 
be comfortable with being 
uncomfortable.”
After that, McDermott 
said, the course focused on 
selling products and get-
ting funding from venture 
capitalists. 
For the ?nal apprentice-
ship, Culbertson gave each 
group of students a seed 
fund and asked them simply 
to make as much money as 
possible, which, McDermott 
said, “is the heart of entrepre-
neurship.”
McDermott is also author 
of a change.org petition to 
“Save RF Culbertson and 70-
419,” which currently has 579 
signatures. According to the 
petition, “By signing this peti-
tion, we as students stand to-
gether to save one of the most 
in?uential classes taught 
here at Carnegie Mellon, and 
to save the man who has giv-
en so much to this school and 
its students.”
McDermott has reached 
out to the administration of 
the Tepper School of Busi-
ness, focusing on how the 
loss of Culbertson’s course 
affects not only current stu-
dents but future students, as 
well as alumni relations.
“We just want to highlight 
— whether the course gets 
reinstated or not — the cus-
tomer at CMU; if we talk in 
terms of sales, the customer 
is a student. And so if you’re 
[angering] your customer,

Slackman talks about foreign policy in the Middle East
BRADEN KELNER
Editor-in-Chief
He lived in Egypt for eight 
years — three as a correspon-
dent for the Los Angeles Times 
and ?ve for The New York 
Times — and returned to the 
region to witness the dramatic 
con?ict in the Middle East dur-
ing the Arab Spring.
Speaking before a half-
?lled auditorium in Porter 
Hall, now Deputy Foreign 
Editor for The New York Times 
Michael Slackman visited 
Carnegie Mellon on Tuesday 
to discuss the United States’s 
role abroad, particularly in 
the Middle East. The discus-
sion was presented by The New 
York Times, Undergraduate 
Student Senate, and the Col-
legiate Readership Program.
During his discussion, 
Slackman stressed the impor-
tance of the citizen’s respon-
sibility to be informed. “Just 
read about the world about 
you,” he said. “It’s what ev-
eryone in the world is ?ghting 
for right now — the people in 
Ukraine, the people in Egypt 
— you have the right to have 
that information.”
Slackman told the story of 
the day he was ?red at in the 
island country of Bahrain in 
February 2011. Slackman was 
dispatched to Bahrain when a 
community of Shiite Muslims 
demanded rights from the rul-
ing Sunni Muslim family dur-
ing a series of peaceful pro-
tests. “Members of the Shiite 
community were coming out 
by the tens of thousands — 
hundreds of thousands — and 
they were determined to push 
for their rights,” Slackman 
said during an interview with 
The Tartan.
One day, abut a thousand 
young protesters marched to 
Pearl Square in Manama, Bah-
rain’s capital.
They were ?red upon by 
the police. Slackman and his 
colleagues ran from the con-
?ict, but were ?red upon too. 
“A helicopter ... ?ew overhead, 
and I thought we were be-
ing shot at by the helicopter,” 
Slackman said. 
He ran into an alley with a 
colleague and saw the helicop-
ter follow. “And that was when 
I was like ... they’re hunting 
us.” A car drove by and Slack-
man screamed at it before the 
driver took him away from the 
area.
Slackman told the audi-
ence, “What foreign corre-
spondents do is they bear wit-
ness.” He said correspondents 
witness events so that people 
have access to information 
about the world around them 
— so that they can be respon-
sibly informed citizens.
“Being a reporter is one of 
the most thrilling and reward-
ing jobs you can have,” Slack-
man said to The Tartan. “It 
allows you to experience life 
through someone else’s eyes ... 
to give voice to the downtrod-
den and the oppressed.”
Slackman then turned 
the discussion to the United 
States’s involvement in the 
Middle East, as well as Crimea. 
He questioned, “How much of

Underage Drinking 
March 29, 2014
A University Police of?cer 
on patrol saw a visibly intoxi-
cated male at the intersection 
of Forbes and Morewood Av-
enues. After stopping to check 
on the individual, the of?cer 
con?rmed that he was under 
21. The man, who was not 
a Carnegie Mellon af?liate, 
was cited for underage drink-
ing and given further medical 
assistance.
Underage Drinking and 
False ID Card
March 29, 2014
University Police cited a 
Carnegie Mellon student who 
was visibly intoxicated in front 
of Hamburg Hall. At the time, 
the student presented the of-
?cer with a false ID card, and 
was later con?rmed to be un-
der the legal drinking age. 
The student was cited for two 
offenses — underage drinking 
and carrying a false ID — and 
was given medical aid.
Underage Drinking 
March 30, 2014
A Carnegie Mellon student 
was cited after she passed out 
in the television lounge of 
Hamerschlag House. A secu-
rity of?cer checking the area 
noticed the unconscious stu-
dent and checked on her. Uni-
versity Police later con?rmed 
that she was under the legal 
drinking age, and transported 
the female to the hospital for 
further treatment after citing 
her for underage drinking.
University Police also cited 
a Carnegie Mellon student 
who had passed out while 
eating at Skibo Cafe. A passer-
by who noticed the student 
called University Police, who 
found the student slumped 
over with his face resting on 
a plate of food. The male was 
identi?ed and cited for under-
age drinking, and after being 
tended to by CMU EMS, was 
released in the care of a sober 
friend.
Suspicious Activity 
April 1, 2014
University Police respond-
ed to Mudge House after a 
student reported to University 
Police that at 8:55 p.m. he was 
walking on Morewood Avenue 
near Stever House when a 
gray or brown Cadillac pulled 
up next to him. According to 
the student, a black male in 
his mid-thirties or early for-
ties rolled down the window 
and reached for the glove 
compartment, while the ve-
hicle was at a complete stop. 
The student, who was afraid 
of being robbed, ran away and 
could not con?rm the driver’s 
intention.

Last week, many students 
and faculty members who 
used the restroom facilities 
in the Gates Hillman Com-
plex noticed that the toilet 
water was markedly blue. In 
an email to many computer 
science students, Director 
of Building Facilities James 
Skees wrote that the blue toi-
let water was a byproduct of 
the complex’s many “green” 
initiatives.
The complex, which is a 
gold LEED-certi?ed building, 
has a gray water system that 
“collects rainwater from the 
building’s rooftops, ?lters out 
the dirt, and stores the wa-
ter in a big tank on the third 
?oor until it is needed for 
?ushing urinals and toilets 
in the building,” according 
to Skees’s email. “This cuts 
down on the surge of storm 
water ?owing into the city 
sewer system as well as limits 
our use of treated city water 
for ?ushing purposes,” the 
email continues.
According to Skees, the 
water previously often had a 
cloudy or even yellow-tinted 
appearance, leading many 
restroom patrons to “assume 
this means the water still has 
urine in it, either because a 
?ush didn’t occur or didn’t 
empty the bowl entirely,” the 
email says. The Allegheny 
County Health Department, 
however, requires a dye be 
put in the gray water before 
it is sent to the restrooms, lest 
anyone try to drink the toilet 
or urinal water, thinking it is 
chlorinated and ?ltered city 
water.
When the Gates Hillman 
Complex was constructed, 
Facilities Management Ser-
vices (FMS) decided to use 
yellow dye, “not realizing 
how it would end up looking 
in the toilets,” the email says. 
Their other option, Skees 
wrote, was to “put little signs 
next to all the ?xtures which 
said something like ‘toilet 
and urinal water is not drink-
able.’ ”
Recently, FMS decided to 
switch to blue dye in the re-
cycled water, leading to the 
blue-tinted toilet and urinal 
water in the complex.
Blue water in GHC toilets raises questions 
Carnegie Mellon students make strong showing in annual Putnam Competition
The Mathematical As-
sociation of America’s 74th 
William Lowell Putnam 
Competition recently tested 
students on high-level cre-
ative thinking and mathe-
matical concepts, giving over 
4,000 Canadian and U.S. un-
dergraduate students from 
557 institutions six hours to 
solve 12 dif?cult problems. 
Carnegie Mellon placed sec-
ond overall in the Putnam 
Competition, according to a 
university press release.
Thirty-?ve students 
scored among the top 10 
percent of competitors, the 
second most of any univer-
sity. The only university who 
placed above Carnegie Mel-
lon in the Putnam Competi-
tion was the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. This 
year is the third consecutive 
year that the Carnegie Mel-
lon team has placed among 
the top ?ve teams, putting 
the university among only 
11 others that have placed in 
the top ?ve more than twice 
since 1990.
Although over 150 Carn-
egie Mellon students partici-
pated in the Putnam Com-
petition, the of?cial team 
comprised of math majors 
sophomore Linus Hamilton, 
?rst-year Thomas Swayze, 
and junior Michael Druggan. 
All of the team members are 
Knaster-McWilliams Schol-
ars, part of a program fund-
ed by alumni of Carnegie 
Mellon’s physics and electri-
cal and computer engineer-
ing programs.
“Repeated success in the 
Putnam Competition makes 
Carnegie Mellon shine like 
a beacon, showing the ex-
treme talent that gathers 
here,” said Po-Shen Loh, 
assistant professor of math-
ematical sciences and the 
team’s coach, in the press re-
lease. “It is our hope that by 
bringing ambitious students 
together, they can work with 
each other to achieve success 
for themselves, the universi-
ty and the region.”
The Carnegie Mellon 
team placed ?fth in the 2012 
Putnam Competition and 
second in 2011, with ad-
ditional top-?ve ?nishes in 
1946, 1949, and 1987. The 
university’s department of 
mathematics will receive 
$20,000, with each team 
member additionally receiv-
ing $800.

Senate thanked those who 
helped out with The New York 
Times lecture event and who  
helped with public relations 
for the Sal Khan lecture. Sen-
ate also congratulated electri-
cal and computer engineering 
and business administration 
double major Ian Glasner and 
biological sciences major 
Shalini Ray on their elections 
to student body president and 
student body vice president, 
respectively. Civil and envi-
ronmental engineering and 
engineering and public policy 
double major Colin Chadder-
ton and senior biological sci-
ences major Lindsay MacGilli-
vray reminded Senate that the 
last installment of the “First 
Lectures” series will take place 
on April 17.
Finance Allocation
Senate allocated $4,500 to 
the Mindfulness Room. Student 
Body President and senior bio-
logical sciences major Lindsay 
MacGillivray presented in front 
of Senate and described the 
purpose of the money. When 
the Mindfulness Room was con-
structed, money from several 
sources was used to re?t what 
was then the West Wing TV 
Lounge and buy equipment — 
like yoga mats and plant walls 
— for the room. The motion 
was unanimously passed.
Points of Discussion
First-year artchitecture 
major Victoria Yong was ap-
proved as a new member at 
large. Class council and a po-
tential budget outline were 
also discussed. 
Senate also discussed pur-
chasing food for meetings. 
Typically, Senate provides 
food at 4:30 p.m., half an hour 
before general body meeting 
starts. 
Often, there is no food 
left by the time the meeting 
begins at 5 p.m. Members 
agreed that Senate should or-
der more food, so that those 
who arrive at 5 p.m. are still 
able to eat.

---------------------------------------------------

how is that going to translate 
into money from donations in 
the future?” McDermott said. 
“As a student, I don’t want 
CMU to have a lower endow-
ment because they [angered] 
alumni in their thirties who 
love [Culbertson], who this 
guy has done everything for.”
“I’m in engineering; I’m 
not really behind the business 
program,” McDermott said. 
“I took the course because I 
thought it would be interest-
ing, and it changed my life. 
And I want that to continue for 
future students.”
According to a news re-
lease from the Tepper School 
of Business, “We appreciate 
the sentiment expressed by 
members of the campus com-
munity via social media, as 
through other communication 
channels, and will thought-
fully consider the perspectives 
that are expressed. However, 
the school will not publicly 
discuss speci?c details relating 
to our curriculum decisions.”
Michael Trick, senior as-
sociate dean of education for 
the Tepper School of Business, 
said that Tepper, and Carnegie 
Mellon as a whole, is in the 
midst of reforming its entre-
preneurship offerings. “This 
has been a great time for en-
trepreneurship at the school. 
We have a track for it in the 
business school; we have a 
new minor out of economics 
called economics, entrepre-
neurship, and innovation,” 
Trick said. “As a minor, in the 
Tepper school, you can pick 
up entrepreneurship courses. 
There’s a good number of 
ways to get entrepreneurship 
courses.”
While Trick did not com-
ment on why Culbertson’s 
course was removed from 
Carnegie Mellon’s Fall 2014 
course offerings, he said that 
it was important to have ac-
tual entrepreneurs teaching 
entrepreneurship to students. 
“When you think of entrepre-
neurship training, the concept 
of mentoring, the concept of 
getting real entrepreneurship 
teaching the students, is an 
incredibly important one,” 
Trick said. “We’ve had more 
adjuncts hired in the last three 
years than in any time. So, 
while we use tenure-track fac-
ulty and teaching-track facul-
ty, we also use entrepreneurs, 
and they are fantastic.”
Culbertson is a well-known 
entrepreneur outside of Carn-
egie Mellon; according to Mc-
Dermott, he began at a young 
age as an entrepreneur by 
starting his own taxi and lim-
ousine service, and from there 
has been “buying and selling 
companies and starting and 
selling companies for 25 or 30 
years.”
Culbertson is currently 
the chief executive of?cer of 
Eidoserve, Inc., a privately 
held company that, according 
to Bloomberg BusinessWeek, 
“develops interactive voice 
response (IVR) solutions with 
integrated mobile, Web, and 
avatar dialogue platforms 
for customers in the United 
States.” In March 2010, Culb-
ertson gave a talk called “Get-
ting Rich and Staying There” 
as part of TEDxCMU.
Culbertson, McDermott said, 
also teaches for Carnegie Mel-
lon without pay. “He does it 
for free because he loves just 
teaching to students. There’s 
no expense to CMU whatso-
ever,” McDermott said.
In an email sent to Culbert-
son early Saturday morning, 
Trick wrote, “After consulting 
with the entrepreneurship 
faculty, I have decided that we 
will no longer be offering your 
Apprenticeship course. As part 
of our revamping of the curric-
ulum, I need to rationalize our 
entrepreneurship offerings. 
This involves providing a clear 
sequence of courses, with one 
‘gateway’ course leading on to 
more advanced offerings, in-
creasingly offered by tenure-
track faculty. The Apprentice-
ship course does not ?t in this 
sequence.”
In the current entrepre-
neurship sequence, students 
start with one of several in-
troductory entrepreneurship 
courses, such as 70-415: Intro-
duction to Entrepreneurship, 
before moving on to more 
advanced electives. Culbert-
son’s course, Trick said, was 
free-standing, and did not act 
as a prerequisite for any oth-
er entrepreneurship course 
offerings.
Dean of Student Affairs 
Gina Casalegno, who works to 
facilitate discussions between 
students and faculty about 
matters such as this one, 
echoed Tricks’ sentiments 
about Carnegie Mellon’s en-
trepreneurship offerings.
According to Casalaegno, 
“[Carnegie Mellon] is look-
ing at its entrepreneurship 
options for both the Tepper 
curriculum and for all of cam-
pus, and has been really well 
articulated, I think, in hav-
ing the move to the Tepper 
Quad being a hub for all dis-
ciplines to collaborate and to 
really enhance the thrust of 
entrepreneurship as a coalesc-
ing theme for students in all 
programs.”
When Casalegno heard 
over the weekend from stu-
dents and alumni after it was 
announced that 70-419 would 
not be offered, she contacted 
Trick and Dean of the Tepper 
School of Business Robert M. 
Dammon and “let them know 
I was hearing from students, 
and that I wanted to know 
how [Trick] would like me to 
encourage their direct engage-
ment with him. He responded 
immediately and said ‘please 
have them get in touch with 
me and the dean so that we 
can hear feedback and con-
sider all of it.’ ”
Trick similarly said that, al-
though he welcomes the input 
from students, it is unlikely 
the course will be reinstated. 
“In everything we do, we wel-
come the input, even if it’s tell-
ing me I’m an idiot, because 
it tells me about the student 
experience, what the students 
?nd valuable,” Trick said. 
“And that’s important to me. I 
cannot crowd source running 
this business school, but what 
I need is that input. And I am 
not shying away from any in-
put on any other decisions I 
am making.”
Zaneta Grant, a junior 
economics and professional 
writing double major who is 
currently taking 70-419, said 
that Culbertson’s course will 
be sorely missed. “It’s my fa-
vorite class I’ve taken since 
coming to CMU, ... this has 
been my favorite class to date 
because it encourages me to 
think outside the box,” Grant 
said.

Khan tells his story to CMU 
how many of you watch 
YouTube, but most of the 
comments are not ‘Thank 
you,’ ” Khan said. “Then 
[the comments] got more 
intense, like ‘this is the rea-
son I passed algebra,’ ‘this is 
the reason I decided to ma-
jor in engineering.’ ”
Khan’s success on You-
Tube kick-started his career 
as one of the most well-
known online educators in 
the U.S.
Khan’s mission is “to 
provide a free world-class 
education for anyone, 
anywhere.”
“Education has always 
been the key determinant 
between the haves and have 
nots, but it has always been 
scarce and it has always 
been expensive,” Khan said. 
Khan sees online educa-
tion as a “once in a millen-
nium” chance to change 
education’s inaccessibility 
by giving his content away 
for free.
Khan was in Pittsburgh 
to receive the 19th annual 
Heinz Award for his ad-
vancement of the human 
condition. 
His speech at Carnegie 
Mellon is part of the Distin-
guished Lecture Series for 
President Subra Suresh’s 
newly launched Simon Ini-
tiative, which will explore 
technology-enhanced edu-
cation such as the Khan 
Academy.
Khan closed his talk with 
an anecdote to illustrate the 
potential he sees for more 
widespread education de-
livered with novel technolo-
gy to transform our society.
“If you were to go back 
400 years to Western Eu-
rope, you had a 15–20 per-
cent literacy rate,” Khan 
said. “If you asked a clergy 
member, ‘What percentage 
of the population is capable 
of reading,’ they might have 
said … ‘40 or 50 percent are 
even capable of reading.’ 
We now know that’s widely 
pessimistic; the answer is 
pretty close to 100 percent.”
The historical example 
was meant to show how 
easy it is to doubt students. 
Khan ended his lecture by 
challenging the audience.
“What similar blinders 
do we have on today? If we 
ask ourselves what percent-
age of people are capable 
of understanding quantum 
physics, you might say may-
be one percent, maybe ?ve 
percent ... what percentage 
of people are capable of 
contributing to genomics re-
search? Maybe ten percent, 
maybe 15 percent ... But 
what if over the next 10 or 
20 years, … that gets closer 
to 100 percent? ... [What] if 
education becomes a basic 
human right?”
“I think that will be a 
very exciting time to live,” 
Khan concluded.

CURRICULUM, from A3
Slackman speaks on Middle East
an actor should the United 
States be in other nations’ 
revolutions?”
Slackman compared Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s current 
foreign affairs footprint to 
former President George W. 
Bush’s footprint. President 
Obama’s footprint is much 
smaller than Bush’s foot-
print was, Slackman said. He 
explained that Bush’s term 
ended after two wars and two 
occupations and resulted in 
resentment from several parts 
of the world. 
Meanwhile, President 
Obama promoted foreign 
policy through an aggres-
sive diplomatic core, Slack-
man said. While Bush turned 
to his defense secretary for 
matters of foreign policy, 
President Obama turned to 
his treasury secretary to pro-
mote sanctions. “It seemed to 
be working fairly well until 
now,” he said. “Right about 
now everybody’s asking, ‘Has 
the lighter footprint run out 
of gas? Is the world coming 
apart and moving backward 
again because the United 
States is taking a different ap-
proach?’ ”
“What’s playing out is very 
mobile and it is kind of im-
mune to the in?uence from 
abroad,” he answered, not-
ing that it is misguided to 
ask what America and other 
outsiders should or shouldn’t 
be doing in the Middle East: 
“What’s happening now is a 
search for identity.” 
He said that the United 
States and Western Europe 
have trouble accepting the 
search for identity by coun-
tries in the Middle East while 
they stand by. 
“But that’s not to say that 
there’s no role for the inter-
national community in the 
Middle East,” Slackman said. 
“And if there’s one thing that 
I’d like you guys to take away 
tonight, I want you to think 
about Syria.”
Syria is a country of 23 
million people, over half of 
which are displaced. Slack-
man said that people in Syria 
are caught between a bru-
tal dictatorship and foreign 
powers, but the United States 
has not become heavily in-
volved. He stated that maybe 
the United States shouldn’t 
have applied the lessons it 
learned from Iraq to Syria. 
“The humanitarian crisis that 
we’re experiencing in Syria 
is unprecedented in my life,” 
he said. “It breaks my heart 
when I think about what’s 
happening in Syria.”
Slackman ended his talk 
with the assertion that the 
Obama administration has 
not articulated it’s foreign 
policy well, but that if a dem-
ocratic nation like the United 
States is not going to get in-
volved in a foreign affair like 
the situation in Syria, the na-
tion has to explain why. Slack-
man then opened the ?oor for 
discussion.
Business Affairs Commit-
tee Chair for Student Senate 
and newly elected Student 
Body Vice President for Fi-
nance Divya Kothandapani 
said about Slackman, “I 
thought it was important 
that someone [in media] 
come and explain how media 
works — how newspapers, 
editors, and writers — what 
they think, their thought pro-
cess, and giving a different 
perspective.”
As Business Affairs Com-
mittee Chair, Kothandapani, 
a sophomore electrical and 
computer engineering major, 
oversees the Collegiate Read-
ership Program and works 
with The New York Times 
through this program. 
The program is respon-
sible for providing newspa-
pers across campus in various 
campus buildings and dorms, 
including the University Cen-
ter and Resnik House. 
Students pay a ?ve dollar 
media fee each academic year 
for the papers, which are oth-
erwise free throughout the 
year.

Slackman spoke on Tuesday about his experiences as a journalist in the Middle East, as well as the U.S.’s 
involvement in the changes occurring in the region. 
Election results for 2014 posted
position,” Michalak said. “I 
wanted to be able to make 
sure somebody with the ex-
perience relevant to the posi-
tion got it, and the best way 
to do that was to run.”
“A lot of people see the 
organizations of Carnegie 
Mellon as the bread and 
butter of the university,” Mi-
chalak said, stating that he 
wished to immediately focus 
on improving the organiza-
tion recognition process and 
encourage graduate student 
participation and representa-
tion in student organizations.
Ray spoke of her joint can-
didacy with Glasner, saying, 
“It ended up being the per-
fect relationship, because we 
weren’t best buddies before 
we came in, so we had that 
sense of respect for each oth-
er. But now we get along so 
well; we will crack jokes with 
each other all the time.” She 
added, “It’s great. I honestly 
love working with him.”
“From what I’ve seen so 
far, we work very well togeth-
er,” Glasner agreed. “There 
hasn’t been too much experi-
ence on the working relation-
ship between the two of us 
because the work’s just get-
ting started.”
Ray encouraged students, 
saying, “don’t be hesitant to 
approach us with anything. 
We have enough experience 
to make things work.”
Glasner stated that he 
was honored to have been 
elected as SBP and said, “I re-
ally want to help improve the 
student experience at Carn-
egie Mellon, and if anyone 
has good ideas, I absolutely 
want them to share them 
with me. I look forward to a 
productive year.”

April Fool’s computer science conference gets many laughs
NIVEDITA CHOPRA
Assistant Copy Manager
Last Tuesday, on April 
Fool’s Day, the Association of 
Computational Heresy (ACH) 
held its eighth annual SIG-
BOVIK conference, a tongue-
in-cheek, computer-science-
themed conference, in a 
packed Rashid Auditorium. 
The conference showcased 
papers about fake, though hu-
morous, research in computer 
science submitted by students 
and faculty. In the words of 
one of the presenters, “This 
is a really good year for at-
tendance! I think this might 
be the ?rst year that we an-
nounced the food.”
Emcee Tom Murphy VII 
(SCS ‘07), began by welcom-
ing the audience to “SIGBO-
VIK 1,000” — a play on the 
fact that the number eight 
is 1,000 in binary. He then 
showcased a web application, 
“SIGBOVIK plays Twitch plays 
Pokémon plays SIGBOVIK,” 
where the audience members 
could press keys to change 
the posture of a stick ?gure 
on the screen, in a manner 
similar to Twitch plays Poké-
mon, a crowdsourced social 
experiment in which Pokémon 
is played via the video-stream-
ing website Twitch by parsing 
commands from users world-
wide. Murphy stipulated that 
the SIGBOVIK presenters must 
maintain the same stance as 
the stick ?gure on the screen 
at all times while presenting, 
which was how the contrap-
tion in turn “played SIGBO-
VIK”. Murphy then called on 
the ?rst speaker, Jim McCann 
(SCS ‘10), who now creates 
video games on his own web-
site, TCHOW (The Chicken’s 
House of Wacky).
McCann introduced him-
self as associated with TCHOW 
LLC, and began with a 30-sec-
ond description of his latest 
game, TCHOW Rainbow. He 
went on to discuss crypto-
graphically-sound jokes and 
optimality of jokes, but kept 
returning to this introduction 
and 30-second plug after ev-
ery few slides, adding to the 
hilarity of the presentation. 
One of the funniest parts of his 
presentation was the follow-
ing cryptographically-sound 
joke, that was also published 
in the conference proceedings:
“What do you call a preda-
tory ?sh, endorsed by the 
NIST and NSA?”
“A 6265a4a07968a7c1d-
f16a61004fb7191177cafd4, of 
course.”
This huge string is actu-
ally SHA (‘rk’), where SHA, or 
Secure Hash Algorithm, is a 
hash function commonly used 
in cryptography. McCann also 
discussed the structure of a 
joke, proposing that a joke was 
composed of a “set up” and a 
“punch line” and depicted 
this structure using a logical 
system. He also gave various 
examples of optimal jokes, 
including “knock-knock” and 
“reverse knock-knock” jokes.
Patrick Xia, a Ph.D. student 
in computer science, present-
ed DollarCoin, a new crypto-
currency, as an alternative to 
Bitcoin. DollarCoin is mined, 
or generated, by burning a $1 
bill, while taking a video of 
the burning process in a speci-
?ed manner. In his paper, Xia 
proves that burning the bill in 
this speci?ed manner ensures 
that the currency cannot be 
forged or double spent. The 
highlight of Xia’s presentation 
was a demonstration of this 
process of generating a Dol-
larCoin, taking a dollar bill out 
of his pocket and lighting it on 
?re.
Stefan Muller, a second-
year Ph.D. student in com-
puter science, demonstrated a 
new and better web browser. 
Muller believes that standard 
browsers are inef?cient pieces 
of software because they use 
a lot of memory, display ad-
vertisements, and are prone 
to security vulnerabilities. 
He declared that the root of 
the problem was the features 
in the web browser, because 
“every time you add a new 
feature to a browser, you’re 
slowing your browser down, 
hogging more CPU resources 
and potentially you’re intro-
ducing bugs into the soft-
ware.” Muller’s solution is 
Aluminum, the world’s fastest 
and most secure browser, with 
no extra features beyond the 
necessary functions of a web 
browser. 
Muller displayed his own 
website using the browser and 
it turned out to be just plain 
text, not the nicely-rendered 
pages that we usually see on a 
browser. According to Muller, 
rendering a website is a “fea-
ture,” hence not part of this 
minimalist browser. He then 
went on to show how chunks 
of the website could be viewed 
on his phone, using text mes-
sages. This demonstration led 
to a great deal of amusement 
among the audience, due to 
the fact that all the chunks 
of his website didn’t actually 
show up via text message, and 
even if they had, it didn’t look 
like they were sent in a partic-
ular order.
This humor-?lled confer-
ence contained several op-
portunities for laughter. For 
more laughs, the conference 
proceedings can be found at

Lin analyzes Boston bombing using geocoded Twitter data
BROOKE KUEI
SciTech Editor
According to The Boston 
Globe, on April 15, 2013, three 
people were killed and over 
260 others injured during the 
Boston Marathon bombing. 
In relation to the tragedy, Yu-
Ru Lin, an assistant professor 
of the School of Information 
Sciences at the University of 
Pittsburgh, as well as a Bos-
tonian herself, presented a 
Human-Computer Interaction 
seminar lecture last Wednes-
day, titled “The Diffusion of 
Fear, Comfort, and Solidar-
ity during the Boston bomb-
ing.” In the lecture, she used 
Twitter data to study how 
communities are affected by 
tragedies.
“How do we examine fear, 
its diffusion, and its relation-
ship to other community 
dynamics?” posed Lin at the 
beginning of her lecture. She 
explained that past studies 
on how catastrophes affect 
communities rely mainly on 
surveys, which are unreliable 
because of time lag and mem-
ory bias. 
Instead, Lin’s approach 
uses data obtained from geo-
coded tweets: “Social media, 
like Twitter, allows me to 
sample large populations and 
study how people respond to 
real world events. This imme-
diate response would avoid 
biases of memories.” Lin also 
noted that the data from these 
tweets allows her to study 
larger geographical areas.
She used over 180 million 
tweets which came from 95 of 
the largest cities in the world 
— 60 from the United States 
and 35 from other countries.
One focus of Lin’s study 
was fear. In order to deter-
mine which tweets express 
fear and which do not, Lin 
used the fear lexicon, a col-
lection of words that linguists 
have determined to be associ-
ated with fear. 
As an example, Lin ex-
plained that in the tweet, 
“What the hell just hap-
pened in Boston?” the word 
“hell” would contribute to 
the tweet’s fear index. To 
demonstrate the validity 
of this method of indexing, 
Lin showed that on a graph 
of fear indices versus time, 
tweets from the city of Boston 
showed peaks on the day of 
the bombing, as well as a few 
days later, when a manhunt 
occurred.
To determine how the 
fear felt by Bostonians cor-
responded to the fear felt by 
people living outside Boston, 
Lin studied shared fear. “To 
study how people’s fear re-
sponse is similar to that of 
the people from Boston, we 
computed a shared fear as the 
temporal correlation of fear 
indices after the bombing,” 
Lin explained.
Lin also focused on two 
types of social support: com-
fort and solidarity. Comfort 
was measured by the frequen-
cy the hashtag #prayforbos-
ton was used, and solidarity 
was measured by the frequen-
cy the hashtag #bostonstrong 
was used.
In Lin’s study, she endeav-
ored to use tweets from the 
two weeks prior to the Bos-
ton Marathon bombing to 
predict the amount of fear, 
comfort, and solidarity that 
was observed in cities outside 
of Boston after the bombing. 
The factors which Lin used to 
try to make these predictions 
were geoproximity (how close 
someone lived to Boston), so-
cial connections (the strength 
of social connections, based 
on the number of replies sent 
between cities), and visits (if 
a person visited Boston re-
cently). She looked at these 
factors both individually and 
in combinations.
Using these models, Lin 
discovered that the personal 
visit factor had the greatest 
impact on whether a per-
son from outside Boston felt 
fear during the same periods 
that Bostonians were feel-
ing fear. She also found that 
the geo-social combination 
model was the best predictor 
for solidarity, although when 
she looked at just cities which 
were far from Boston, the best 
predictor was the visit factor. 
The best predictor for comfort 
was, again, the visit factor.
But how does shared fear 
correspond to comfort and 
solidarity? Lin found that 
fear is signi?cantly associated 
with solidarity, but not with 
comfort. “So what this means 
is that, holding other factors 
constant, cities with more 
shared fear tend to show more 
solidarity,” Lin said. This re-
sult is interesting, because it 
suggests that fear could have 
a productive role in social 
support.
Although Lin’s study of-
fers a comprehensive picture 
of community dynamics fol-
lowing the Boston Marathon 
bombing, she ended her talk 
with an invitation for collabo-
ration with Carnegie Mellon 
researchers to further im-
prove the study.

In recent years, Missouri-
based chemical company 
Monsanto has generated 
nearly-endless negative press 
associated with their ge-
netically modi?ed Roundup 
Ready crops. The crops, de-
spite not being Monsanto’s 
primary products, are de-
signed to be pesticide- and 
herbicide-resistant or even 
produce their own pesticides. 
This ability theoretically al-
lows crops to have a higher 
survival rate, allowing a high-
er yield for farmers. The crops 
are incredibly controversial 
and have come under ?re for 
being a threat to everything 
from human health to scien-
ti?c research. However, high 
pro?le public battles like the 
one over genetically modi-
?ed organisms (GMOs) pro-
duce many myths on both 
sides, making the heart of the 
Monsanto debate very hard to 
access.
The major genetically 
modi?ed crops created by 
Monsanto are designed to 
withstand Monsanto pesti-
cides. While very few crops 
have actually been commer-
cially released by Monsanto 
(Roundup Ready versions 
of corn, canola, cotton, soy-
beans, squash, and papaya, 
to be exact), these crops ac-
count for a huge share of ag-
riculture and the effects of the 
pesticides can be devastating. 
The increase in pesticides has 
created large populations of 
pesticide-resistant insects. 
This leads to Monsanto nearly 
?ghting an arms race every 
year with bugs that are be-
coming increasingly resis-
tant to Roundup and other 
chemicals used to kill pests 
and weeds. These population 
changes could drastically af-
fect ecosystems, as well as the 
increase in foreign chemicals 
as local ?ora and fauna fail to 
adapt. Another threat to local 
ecosystems is Monsanto seeds 
that are blown out of the con-
?nes of the farms on which 
they are grown, which could 
also lead to contamination 
with local populations and 
change the landscape very 
quickly.
Monsanto has also come 
under ?re for what is called 
the Terminator Gene, accord-
ing to NPR, with claims that 
Monsanto seeds are sterile. 
People argue that these ster-
ile seeds force farmers to con-
tinuously buy Monsanto seeds 
rather than replanting the 
ones already produced. While 
Monsanto has isolated the 
Terminator Gene, they deny 
using it in their crops. 
Further, buying new seeds 
each year is a common prac-
tice for farmers. The Termina-
tor Gene can also help prevent 
Monsanto crops from acting 
as invasive species, as the 
seeds terminate and cannot 
grow.
Another thing muddling 
this debate is a common ten-
dency to equate Monsanto 
and GMOs. While companies 
like DuPont are also part of 
the market, Monsanto holds a 
massive amount of the market 
share, and it is very dif?cult 
for GMO producing compa-
nies to start up because the 
negative press of Monsanto 
has spread to GMOs. GMOs 
are widely disliked, largely 
because of some of Monsan-
to’s business practices, but 
mostly anti-GMO sentiment 
has fueled the charge against 
Monsanto. However, under 
closer examination it seems 
Monsanto has used the con-
cept of GMOs for its own gain 
and not for the bene?ts that 
GMOs can yield. 
GMOs have been used for 
extremely positive purposes. 
One example is golden rice, a 
form of rice genetically modi-
?ed to contain vitamin A in 
order to help regions where 
vitamin A de?ciencies are 
extremely common. The pro-
duction of the rice has been 
met with mass resistance, as 
both environmental groups 
and protesters have uproot-
ed crops and prevented the 
spread of the product. This 
resistance stems from a gen-
eral resistance to GMOs, as 
golden rice has undergone ex-
tensive testing and has been 
determined to be safe both 
to eat and for the environ-
ment. It is clear that most of 
the world refuses to eat ge-
netically modi?ed crops de-
spite the scienti?c urge to do 
otherwise.
The most common con-
cern with GMOs is the health 
risk often associated with 
genetically modi?ed foods. 
Many scientists tend to be-
lieve that GMOs are not inher-
ently dangerous, but there is 
a very vocal minority who say 
they are. A common example 
is a 2012 study by Gilles-Éric 
Séralini linking Monsanto 
corn crops to cancer in rats. 
For a vast number of reasons, 
this study was retracted, and 
GMOs are likely safe to eat, 
but that is not the end of 
the debate. These general 
PUGWASH COLUMNMonsanto gives a bad name to genetically modi?ed products

When the ?rst laser was 
produced on May 16, 1960, 
it was described as a solution 
looking for a problem. Today, 
however, lasers are involved 
in many standard procedures 
including surgery, manufac-
turing, and reading barcodes 
and compact discs.
The science behind lasers 
is based in the structure of at-
oms. Atoms contain a nucleus 
of protons and neutrons sur-
rounded by electrons in what 
is called an electron cloud. 
The electron cloud can be 
understood as many differ-
ent orbits, often called energy 
levels, around the nucleus. 
When energy, often in the 
form of heat, is added to an 
atom, electrons are moved 
from their ground state en-
ergy level to a higher energy 
level. This state is called an 
excited state. Electrons in an 
excited state want to return 
to their ground state energy 
level. 
To return to this level, the 
electrons will release energy 
in the form of a photon, which 
is a particle of light.
The word laser is actually 
an acronym for Light Ampli-
?cation by Stimulated Emis-
sion of Radiation. This term 
is a concise way of saying that 
lasers control how atoms re-
lease photons. 
According to LIGHTFAIR 
International, laser light dif-
fers from normal light in three 
important ways: It is mono-
chromatic, coherent, and 
directional. The term mono-
chromatic means that the light 
consists of only one wave-
length of light. Each wave-
length of light corresponds 
to a speci?c color of light, 
and the wavelength of light 
is determined by the energy 
state of the electron and the 
amount of energy released. 
The term coherent means that 
each photon moves in unison 
with the other photons in an 
organized manner. Finally, 
the term directional signi-
?es that the light is released 
in only one direction, which 
makes the beam strong and 
concentrated.
In order to produce laser 
light instead of normal light, 
stimulated emission, or orga-
nized emission, must occur. 
According to howstuffworks.
com, this process begins when 
a burst of light or electrical 
discharge raises atoms in the 
lasing medium to an energy 
level about two or three lev-
els above their ground-state 
energy level. In order to re-
turn to their ground state, 
these electrons emit photons 
of light. 
Stimulated emission oc-
curs when one photon of light 
encounters an electron in the 
same energy level as the origi-
nal electron that created the 
?rst photon. When this hap-
pens, the ?rst photon causes 
the electron to emit a second 
photon of light with the same 
wavelength and direction as 
the original photon.
This effect is enhanced by 
a pair of mirrors located on 
either end of the lasing me-
dium. These mirrors cause 
the photons of light to re?ect 
back and forth through the 
lasing medium. As they travel 
back and forth, the photons 
encounter other electrons and 
cause them to emit photons 
of the same wavelength and 
direction. This process en-
sures that the light is mono-
chromatic, coherent, and di-
rectional. One of the mirrors 
at one end of the laser is “half-
silvered,” which means that it 
re?ects some light and allows 
some light to pass through. 
The light that passes through 
this mirror is the light that we 
see as the laser.
While all lasers perform 
this general function, lasers 
have been split into many dif-
ferent categories. The type 
of laser is often determined 
by the lasing medium. Las-
ing mediums can be solids, 
liquids, gases, or semicon-
ductors. Some common la-
ser types include solid-state 
lasers, gas lasers, excimer la-
sers (with reactive gas laser 
mediums), dye lasers (with 
complex organic dye laser 
mediums), and semiconduc-
tor lasers. Each of these types 
of lasers is able to perform 
slightly different functions. 
According to howstuffworks.
com, gas lasers are often used 
to cut hard materials, where-
as semiconductor lasers are 
often used in laser printers.
Lasers have already be-
come an integral part of our 
daily life, and will continue to 
affect the ?elds of science and 
technology in the future.

The CRISPR-Cas system, 
developed by researchers af-
?liated with The Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology 
(MIT), has shown to correct 
a genetic mutation in mice by 
using gene-snipping machin-
ery from bacteria. With this 
technology, a DNA-cutting 
enzyme binds to a speci?c se-
quence close to the mutation. 
The enzyme is then able to 
cut the DNA and then paste a 
correct, non-mutated version 
of the gene into place. Using 
this method, researchers were 
able to correct a mutation in 
live mice that results in the 
inability to break down the 
amino acid tyrosine. 
The hope is that one day 
this technology can be used to 
cure single-gene disorders in 
humans.

Geologic clock ?nds age of moon
An international team of 
planetary scientists has deter-
mined that the moon formed 
around 100 million years af-
ter the solar system began. 
The international research 
team set up hundreds of simu-
lations of the growth history 
for planets similar to Earth. 
By looking at growth simula-
tions for Earth-like planets, 
they found a relationship 
between the time Earth was 
impacted to create the moon 
and the amount of material 
added afterward. By adding 
information about the mass of 
the Earth to the simulations, a 
“clock” was found in the data. 
Previous research provided 
data on the mass of the Earth 
post-impact.

Researchers reset immune systems
Researchers at Emory Uni-
versity have tested a method 
that “reboots” one’s immune 
system on 20 patients un-
dergoing kidney transplants. 
Normally, when a patient un-
dergoes an organ transplant, 
he or she must take an intense 
drug cocktail to keep the im-
mune system from attacking 
the new organ. The treatment 
begins with a drug, inserted 
intravenously, that signi?-
cantly decreases the amount 
of white blood cells. These 
cells “regrow” over the next 
year, and this time they accept 
the new organ. Doctors give a 
monthly injection of a drug 
that helps the white blood 
cells accept the new organ 
even more; another drug is 
given to suppress some of the 
old cells which might attack.

Ebola outbreak in Western Africa
An outbreak of the Ebo-
la virus has taken the lives 
of more than 80 people in 
Western Africa, mostly in the 
country of Guinea. The World 
Health Organization reports 
a total of 137 cases. Doctors 
Without Borders has been at-
tempting to educate citizens 
about how Ebola is spread, as 
well as help train medical per-
sonnel that may have to deal 
with infected patients. Genet-
ic analysis has indicated that 
the strain of this outbreak is 
most closely related to the 
strain Ebola-Zaire, consid-
ered one of the most deadly of 
Ebola strains.
Ebola causes hemorrhagic 
fever and has a mortality rate 
of over 60 percent.

Transgenic trees better for biofuels
A recent article published 
in Nature shows that trans-
genic poplar trees are easier 
to break down to make paper 
and biofuels. Lignin, a tough 
polymer found in trees, is usu-
ally the most dif?cult part of 
the plant to break down when 
making biofuels or paper. The 
transgenic poplar trees, how-
ever, have a form of lignin 
that is easier to break down.
“The potential for saving 
energy is so high that this 
change should be considered 
in every plant that’s destined 
to be pulped or converted to 
biofuel,” said Professor of bio-
chemistry at the University 
of Wisconsin-Madison John 
Ralph, an author of the paper. 
Ralph and his team have ?led 
patent applications for the ge-
netically modi?ed poplars.

Muscles controlled by reaction to light
Scientists have developed 
a new way to control muscles 
with light. 
The research, developed 
at the University College Lon-
don, involves transplanting 
synthetic motor neurons into 
nerve endings. The neurons 
are made from stem cells and 
react to blue light; scientists 
can control the muscle func-
tion depending on frequency, 
intensity, and pulse of the 
light. These cells may help 
individuals with diseases 
that affect motor neurons 
and cause paralysis, such as 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS).

SCITECH BRIEFS
defenses of GMOs are not al-
ways speci?c to Monsanto. 
Often, Monsanto genetically 
modi?es crops to solve prob-
lems that wouldn’t exist with-
out Monsanto, creating a self-
reinforcing cycle of need for 
Monsanto products. 
Further, Monsanto’s use 
of patent laws makes it ex-
tremely dif?cult to research 
the exact effect Monsanto’s 
crops can have. Researchers 
need permission from the 
company to conduct studies. 
While claims of Monsanto su-
ing people because their crop 
blew into a garden stems from 
a sensationalized version of 
one lawsuit, something simi-
lar happens with scienti?c re-
search where Monsanto will 
often refuse to give people 
the rights to research their 
products.
Genetically modi?ed or-
ganisms and Monsanto, at the 
end of the day, are different. 
Monsanto is a chemical com-
pany producing pesticides 
and herbicides to help kill ev-
erything in someone’s garden 
that isn’t a crop. They make 
crops designed so that their 
products do not kill the crops 
too. 
However, with massive 
public resistance to GMOs, 
these crops seem to be what 
we get from GMOs for the 
near future. With the poten-
tial of foods that can make 
more land arable and arable 
land more ef?cient, a com-
pany that designs foods that 
only survive their own prod-
ucts holds a massive share of 
the market, coming close to 
a monopoly. As time goes on, 
will GMOs ever reach their 
full potential, or has Monsan-
to poisoned the well?

Suspended animation risky, could save lives
New student government must ful?ll platforms
No double-booking registration eases stress
University of Pittsburgh Medical 
Center (UPMC) surgeons will soon 
begin human trials on suspended 
animation, which is more formally 
known in the medical community as 
emergency preservation and resus-
citation, according to Medical Daily. 
The technique is intended to give 
doctors more time to ?x life-threaten-
ing wounds, such as gunshot or stab 
wounds, and has been a resounding 
success in non-human trials. The 
pigs used in those trials survived the 
procedure with no cognitive or phys-
ical impairments. The procedure will 
only be used on patients in cardiac 
arrest, and it involves replacing all 
the blood in the body with a cold sa-
line solution, which induces a physi-
cal state very similar to hypothermia. 
If the procedure is successful, other 
hospitals will begin to implement it. 
UPMC should be commended for 
its willingness to innovate and try po-
tentially dangerous procedures in a 
cautious manner. Obviously, the hos-
pital is not attempting the technique 
on any and all patients who come 
into the emergency room. According 
to Dr. Samuel A. Tisherman, the lead 
surgeon in these trials, speaking to 
The Huf?ngton Post, the ideal patient 
for the procedure would be someone 
who was admitted to the hospital 
with a fatal gunshot or stab wound, 
and who did not respond to the con-
ventional treatments the hospital 
currently employs. 
Choosing only patients on the 
edge of death avoids the potential 
ethical mine?eld of using such ex-
treme methods in human trials. 
However, the FDA does not require 
approval from the patient or the fam-
ily, as the patient would die without 
some kind of extreme intervention. 
The procedure itself sounds un-
nerving, like something out of sci-
ence ?ction, especially as the patient 
will be clinically dead for a few hours 
and then revived. Risky medical pro-
cedures, especially in human trials, 
should not be taken lightly; hospitals 
should carefully consider how they 
implement these techniques. 
UPMC has clearly considered the 
risks and is going about these trials 
in a measured and methodical way. 
This unconventional technique has 
the potential to save lives.
Last week the results from the stu-
dent body elections revealed that Ian 
Glasner and Shalini Ray were elected 
as student body president and vice 
president, respectively. Glasner and 
Ray displayed a great deal of con?-
dence and experience in the debates 
held prior to the election and have 
an ambitious platform promised for 
their upcoming term.
It’s important for Glasner and Ray 
to remember and be accountable for 
these goals, ranging from reforms 
of the dining system to changing 
the dorm alcohol policy on campus. 
During the SBP/SBVP debates, they 
displayed their knowledge of the sys-
tems related to student government 
and campus administration in an 
impressive manner, especially with 
Glasner referencing meetings he held 
with various campus of?cials regard-
ing the issues being campaigned on. 
However, a few topics — speci?cally 
the dorm alcohol policy — will be 
dif?cult to accomplish. Glasner and 
Ray need to put their utmost effort 
into representing the wishes of our 
student body and carrying out their 
initiatives in a practical and well-
reasoned way.
Glasner and Ray exhibited re-
markable poise and institutional 
knowledge prior to their election, 
and we hope that they will continue 
to impress as they assume their re-
spective student government roles.  
Similarly, recently-elected Stu-
dent Body Vice President for Finance 
(SBVPF) Divya Kothandapani and 
Student Body Vice President for Or-
ganizations (SBVPO) Jack Micha-
lak must strive to ful?ll their duties 
to the student body as they assume 
of?ce.
Kothandapani’s campaign plat-
form did not promise reforms as bold 
as those suggested by SBP and SBVP 
candidates, but her desire for a more 
comprehensible budgeting process 
would be an excellent addition to the 
current system.
Michalak campaigned on goals 
including expediting the organiza-
tion recognition process and im-
proving how student organizations 
receive advice. His platform also 
addressed supporting broader ini-
tiatives such as improving room 
selection, the installation of gender-
neutral restrooms, and expanding 
the amnesty policy to cover drugs. 
While all important topics, Micha-
lak should focus most of his efforts 
on accomplishing what is most in 
his power to do so. As a sophomore, 
Michalak has the opportunity to run 
for higher student of?ce, where he’d 
have greater power to tackle and 
throw greater support behind some 
of these broader reforms. 
The Tartan congratulates the 
newly elected SBP, SBVP, SBVPF, SB-
VPO, as well as the college senators. 
We hope that those elected will be 
accountable for their promises and 
work with the student body to build 
a better campus community.
No longer will students be able to 
double-book themselves for classes 
during registration. In an email sent 
out to the student body on Thursday, 
University Registrar John Papinchak 
detailed that, in order for students to 
register for two con?icting courses, 
they need to run it by their academ-
ic adviser before registration, and 
must gain permission to take them 
concurrently.
Trying to juggle courses that meet 
at the same time is a risky move for 
students; while it’s sometimes neces-
sary in order for them to complete 
their coursework before they gradu-
ate or for other valid extenuating cir-
cumstances, there is no reason why 
the option should be open to stu-
dents from the start of registration. 
Also, some students that have 
trouble deciding which courses 
to take often overload themselves 
with courses — some of which over-
lap — in order to try each of them, 
then drop the ones they don’t like as 
much. The new registration policy 
will make this practice more dif?cult.
The Associate Deans’ Council 
made a smart move in implementing 
this new registration policy. Not only 
does it encourage students to make 
decisions about their next semester’s 
course work earlier on, but it also 
helps alleviate some stress among 
the student body. Carnegie Mellon is 
known for its stressful and academi-
cally intense environment, and bal-
ancing two classes at the same time 
contributes to that environment. In a 
roundabout way, the faculty and ad-
ministration are helping to combat 
Carnegie Mellon’s “stress culture” 
with this new policy.
Admittedly, this new policy may 
prevent students from getting some 
of the classes that they want. Some 
people have back-up classes lined 
up so that they have a second op-
tion ready and waiting in case they 
don’t get off the waitlist for their 
?rst-choice class that meets at the 
same time, but now students have to 
decide if they want to risk getting off 
the waitlist for that class or take the 
safer route with a different, more ac-
cessible course. 
Despite this drawback, the policy 
will help ease both the registration 
process and students’ stress levels.Shijie Rao/Junior Artist
Malaysia ?ight media coverage misguided
JUSTIN YAN 
It’s almost been a month since 
the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines Flight 
370 was declared lost, and almost 
two weeks since it was of?cially de-
clared to have crashed in the South 
Indian Ocean. 
As numerous planes scour the 
seas for any sign of wreckage or de-
bris, we — the onlookers — have fol-
lowed the news story from the start. 
We have seen the countless theories 
surrounding the ?ight, including 
everything from the pilot and his co-
pilot, stolen passports, hijackings, 
and the Illuminati.
It is important to follow current 
events, yes. They make us well-
informed citizens and enable us to 
participate in a public dialogue with 
our friends, professors, and whom-
ever else we meet. But there comes a 
point when we are overloaded with 
information from the press. The 
press has reached maximum capac-
ity when it comes to Flight 370.
 “On the other 
side of the TV are 
viewers obsessed 
with ?nding this 
?ight. Something 
within our human 
subconscious is 
drawn to such 
tragedies, and 
the surrealism 
of a plane-crash 
contributes to our 
fascination.”
In the past month, I have re-
ceived more than 10 mobile pings 
that have said, “Potential debris 
spotted in Indian (or South China 
Sea) Ocean” or some other variant. 
In fact, according to The Huf?ngton 
Post, CNN reporter Martin Savidge 
has spent the past month or so in a 
?ight simulator testing Flight 370 
theories, inspiring the Twitter trend-
ing hashtag #freemartinsavidge.
Despite the extensive media 
coverage, there have been few sig-
ni?cant developments in the past 
month regarding the ?ight. These 
developments have included, ?rst, 
that the ?ight had disappeared; sec-
ond, that it has been declared lost in 
an area in the South Indian Ocean 
using satellite data, complex calcu-
lations, and the Doppler effect; and 
last, that there have been possible 
debris sightings close to the area 
where the plane is believed to have 
passed through.
But as each day passes without 
con?rmed sighting of the wreck-
age, the media — CNN in particular 
because of its wide, expansive cov-
erage — has resorted to excruciat-
ingly aggravating extrapolation. In 
fact, one headline on CNN even read 
“Was Flight 370 a Zombie Plane?” 
There have been theories — none of 
which are substantiated in any way 
— regarding terror plots, hijackings, 
and a secret message from the plane 
before it vanished. Not only is CNN 
covering the story this way, but the 
other “Big Two” — Fox and NBC 
— have joined in, perhaps in an ef-
fort to boost television ratings in an 
era where news is more mobile and 
Internet-based.
I’m not saying that the CNN or 
news outlets should not be cover-
ing Flight 370. In fact, there are 
some fascinating stories behind it. 
For example, Malaysia’s public re-
lations and general management of 
the ?ight’s disappearance have been 
criticized internationally. Therein 
lies the potential for a story with con-
crete facts and credible sources, one 
that would not be an extrapolation.
However, on the other side of the 
TV are viewers obsessed with ?nd-
ing this ?ight. Something within 
our human subconscious is drawn 
to such tragedies, and the surreal-
ism of a plane crash contributes to 
our fascination. Flights, which used 
to be considered a luxury, are now 
considered to be essential. Air travel 
has connected the world by making 
it so much easier to traverse.
As a result of this accessibility, 
there is a sense of security, ease, and 
comfort, even, to be traveling in a 
metal bird thousands of miles above 
the ground. Then, an incident like 
Flight 370 comes along and disrupts 
our con?dence in such a sense. As a 
result, we are compelled to under-
stand what went wrong, and how 
Flight 370 differed from the millions 
of others. 
That being said, there are several 
issues with the way the “Big Three” 
— CNN, NBC, and Fox — have been 
capitalizing on this innate public 
interest in the doomed ?ight. The 
outlets, by throwing speculations 
and extrapolations, have left us con-
fused and lead us to question their 
authority and integrity on such re-
latable, high-pro?le incidents.

A PERSON’S OPINION
April 7, 2014 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A7
The Tartan is about ready for the biggest Carnegie Mellon event of the year. So we asked,
What are you most excited about for Carnival?
Compiled by Sara Remi Fields
KYLE HENSON 
American Exceptionalism is in 
crisis mode. Maybe President Obama 
articulated it best when he was asked 
about it in 2008. 
“Sure I believe in American Ex-
ceptionalism,” he said, “just like the 
Brits believe in British Exceptional-
ism and the Greeks believe in Greek 
Exceptionalism.”
Some people just don’t believe in 
American Exceptionalism anymore. 
Some people actually ?nd the whole 
notion of American Exceptionalism 
to be unfounded, nationalistic hubris 
created to justify American cockiness 
and aggressive foreign policy. While 
American Exceptionalism and its 
drivers are changing, we are still an 
exceptional nation, but for different 
reasons and with different implica-
tions than before.
To understand this change, one 
must ?rst understand the origins of 
American Exceptionalism and what 
it has historically meant. The idea 
of American Exceptionalism is com-
monly traced back to Governor John 
Winthrop’s 1630 “A Model of Chris-
tian Charity” speech. Winthrop de-
clared, “For we must consider that 
we shall be as a city upon a hill. The 
eyes of all people are upon us.”
Contrary to popular belief, Win-
throp meant that Europe would be 
watching to see how the American 
experiment unfolded, not that we’re 
somehow on a pedestal above other 
nations. He understood that the New 
World provided a platform for trying 
new governance. If we succeeded, 
then people would voluntarily fol-
low our example. The concept of 
American Exceptionalism was never 
meant to prove that we were better 
than everyone else, just different: 
the exception to the European rule.
As American society wore on, we 
developed three factors that set us 
apart from Europe. First amongst 
them is our religiosity. As Alexis 
de Tocqueville noted in his famous 
Democracy In America, we have his-
torically been a very religious set of 
people, and that sets us apart from 
many other nations. de Tocqueville 
noted that, because Americans were 
so religious, we were more inclined 
to work hard, adhere to strict moral 
codes, believe in personal responsi-
bility, take pride in being self-suf?-
cient, and uphold family values.
Additionally, the United States 
has always been a unique defender 
of freedom at home and abroad. In-
ternationally, we were the force that 
turned the tide in both world wars 
and, domestically, our Constitution 
was designed to safeguard against 
tyranny in all forms with careful 
checks and balances of power. Mitt 
Romney took to calling the Unit-
ed States “the hope of the Earth” 
throughout his 2012 campaign, re-
?ecting on our commitment to prop-
agating liberty.
Finally, the circumstances of our 
country’s founding were exception-
al. We were one of the ?rst success-
ful anti-colonial revolutions, and we 
birthed a country that did not have 
a history in feudalism. Because of 
these circumstances, social mobility 
and opportunity have abounded in 
the United States, and the idea of a 
Marxist proletariat working class, 
stuck in squalor, is foreign. We gen-
erally believe that hard work can get 
anyone ahead.
Of course, these three factors 
don’t have positive connotations to 
many groups of people in our coun-
try. Religiosity is de?nitely declin-
ing, especially amongst younger gen-
erations, and religiosity is the main 
driving force for pro-life and anti-
LGBT movements, further alienating 
more and more people as the nation-
al dialogue becomes more accepting.
Additionally, as we look back on 
slavery and racism in America, it’s 
increasingly apparent that we were 
only guardians of domestic freedom 
for white men until about 50 years 
ago, and even now we’re a far cry 
from living in a colorblind society. 
Also, guarding freedom abroad gets 
us into nationally and international-
ly unpopular wars, notably Iraq and 
Vietnam.   
                                                          “No other country 
has a platform 
for intranational 
legislative 
experimentation 
the way that the 
United States 
does ... federalism 
paves the way 
for continued 
innovation and 
improvement.”
Finally, after the recent recession, 
the middle class has become increas-
ingly worse off, and social mobility 
has been damaged. As a recent study 
by The Equality of Opportunity Proj-
ect noted, American social mobility 
is not the same as it was 50 years ago.
Clearly, American Exceptionalism 
and its drivers are changing, but per-
haps appropriately. Fleeing religious 
persecution, dying for freedom, and 
starting fresh on new land aren’t 
even distant memories anymore — 
they’ve entered into the lexicon of 
American folklore. But a change in 
the factors that birthed American Ex-
ceptionalism doesn’t spell its demise. 
We are still an incredibly unique na-
tion, relying on two new factors to 
create a lifestyle and culture that 
can’t be found anywhere else in the 
world: entrepreneurship and feder-
alism. Religiosity contributed to Ex-
ceptionalism because it drove people 
to put in an honest day’s work and 
lead a virtuous lifestyle in the eyes 
of God. Religion is declining as a 
motivating factor, but there are peo-
ple in this country working harder 
than their religious predecessors, 
driven instead by their passion and 
ambition. 
The United States has become 
the global capitol of entrepreneur-
ship, touting enterprising, risk-
taking visionaries who sleep under 
their desks and work long hours into 
nights and weekends to follow their 
dreams and create something they 
believe in. While your stereotypical 
religious family man is seen less and 
less, entrepreneurs are creating their 
own brand of rugged, individualis-
tic apotheosis. It’s hard to imagine 
the lexicon of American folklore 100 
years from now without the names 
Zuckerberg, Gates, and Jobs. With-
out the fear of God, startup culture 
is promoting hard work and driving 
economic growth in a way that’s 
unique to this country.
In the San Francisco area alone, 
there were 7,439 new ventures last 
year, and in New York, Philadel-
phia, Boston, and Pittsburgh com-
bined there were 7,744, according 
to StartupBio.me. Compare that to 
all of Western Europe, which had 
a total of 2,917 new ventures, and 
it becomes apparent that religion 
isn’t necessary to sustain the levels 
of hard work that make our country 
exceptional.
Aiding entrepreneurship in keep-
ing America exceptional, our feder-
alist system of government provides 
a platform for experimental gov-
ernance seen nowhere else in the 
world. The system of states being 
able to experiment with most pow-
ers of government, while all living 
under one prosperous federal frame-
work, gives our government the abil-
ity to adapt to new circumstances 
much quicker than other countries, 
and also allows us to try new policies 
with limited consequences.
Examples of federalism are far 
reaching and varied. SeaTac, a city 
in Washington, recently raised its 
minimum wage to $15 an hour in 
an effort to explore the effects a 
higher minimum wage would have 
on the community. In 2011, Ver-
mont passed statewide legislation 
that created, essentially, the ?rst 
single-payer healthcare system in 
the country. Additionally, Colorado 
and Washington have experimented 
with legalizing recreational marijua-
na, and states across the union have 
started allowing same-sex couples to 
get married.
These changes have had an ef-
fect in Washington and across the 
globe. The Supreme Court struck 
down the Defense of Marriage Act as 
a response to state-by-state same-sex 
marriage legalization. This decision 
has brought the issue of same-sex 
marriage into the national dialogue 
in places like Ireland and Chile, 
where same-sex marriage is still con-
sidered taboo. 
No other country has a platform 
for intranational legislative experi-
mentation the way that the United 
States does, and as the role of gov-
ernment in people’s lives continues 
to change, federalism paves the way 
for continued innovation and im-
provement.
Throughout the course of history, 
our willingness to try new things — 
whether we succeed or fail — has 
paved the way for improvement 
across the globe. 
From the immeasurable amount 
of good that cell phones are doing to 
lift people out of poverty in Africa, 
to understanding that alcohol bans 
aren’t going to work, America’s dif-
ferences have made the world a bet-
ter place.
As Winthrop noted almost 400 
years ago, people around the world 
look to our example to learn. We 
don’t have to be better or worse than 
any other country, just different. 
Let’s keep America weird.

#CancelColbert ?asco is 
social justice gone wrong
American Exceptionalism remains vital
XIYU WANG 
Last week, one of my favor-
ite shows, The Colbert Report, was 
harshly criticized because of a 
tweet: an out-of-context joke about 
the “Ching-Chong-Ding-Dong Foun-
dation for Sensitivity to Orientals 
or Whatever.” Upon reading this 
tweet, Suey Park, a Twitter activist, 
sent out a tweet calling for Colbert’s 
?ring with the hashtag #Cancel-
Colbert, subsequently creating a 
newstorm as various media outlets 
picked up the story. Damn it, news 
corps, you made me care about a 
Twitter hashtag.
Even out of context, the joke was 
not offensive to me, though that 
may just be because I’ve heard one 
too many Ricky Gervais jokes about 
child rape. In context, it is a stretch 
for anyone to call it offensive; it sati-
rizes Washington Redskins owner 
Dan Snyder’s charitable foundation 
for Native Americans, which has 
the term “Redskins” in it. In fact, it 
reaf?rms that “Ching-Chong-Ding-
Dong,” like “Redskins,” is racist.
Upon realizing that she had tak-
en the joke out of context, Park told 
people that she didn’t actually want 
Colbert’s show to be canceled, and 
that she used the hashtag to raise 
awareness for her broader message.
Supporters of #CancelColbert 
claim that comedy should not use 
racial stereotypes, and that satire 
has to be completely clear about 
who it is ridiculing because people 
could misinterpret the use of subtle 
anti-racist humor as a green light to 
use actual racist humor.
There is no special reason why 
comedy in particular, along with ev-
ery other kind of entertainment and 
speech that exists, should not use 
or discuss racial stereotypes. These 
stereotypes won’t go away if we stop 
talking about them. Furthermore, 
all speech can be misinterpreted. 
For instance, Glenn Beck used Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr.’s speeches for his 
conservative causes despite King’s 
advocacy for liberal causes. The val-
ue of any form of speech should not 
be determined by the people who 
misuse it.
Colbert’s critics also claim that 
white men should not comment 
on race, which is a fairly ridicu-
lous assertion. Being white doesn’t 
mean you can’t make good points 
about race. Furthermore, conver-
sation about race relations should 
aim at being inclusive rather than 
exclusive.
More disturbing is the number of 
people who claim that Park’s tactic 
of overreaction, calling to cancel 
Colbert’s show, was justi?able in 
raising these concerns.
Fox News pulled a similar stunt 
in 2010, when it took a quote from 
then-government of?cial Shirley 
Sherrod out of context, painting the 
content of one of her speeches as a 
diatribe against whites, when in re-
ality it was a personal story of racial 
healing. As a result, Sherrod was 
forced to resign from her position 
as Georgia State Director of Rural 
Development for the United States 
Department of Agriculture.
It is unlikely that a celebrity like 
Colbert would be ?red due to #Can-
celColbert, but suppose Park’s target 
had not been Colbert, but some busi-
ness owner or teacher whose words 
were taken out of context. The tac-
tics used by Park and Fox News are 
irresponsible and have the potential 
to damage the careers and lives of 
innocent individuals.
Some people may wonder why 
I’m not criticizing the commentators 
who sent rape and death threats to 
Park. Their behavior is vastly more 
reprehensible, but no reasonable 
person actually thinks such behav-
ior is justi?ed. On the other hand, a 
lot of legitimately in?uential people 
seem to agree with #CancelColbert 
on the views I have mentioned.
Also note that this is not a com-
mentary on social justice in general, 
but rather on these speci?c view-
points that certain members of the 
community hold. There is a place in 
the world for social justice, in a soci-
ety where minorities are still cultur-
ally and politically underrepresent-
ed. However, insular and sterilized 
conversations peppered with knee-
jerk reactions do not in any way ad-
vance social justice causes.

Every year, the month of 
April tends to bring out an 
uneasy sense of excitement 
among soccer fans. It’s the 
time of the year when their 
team is either ?ghting for 
their lives to stay in the top-

European quali?cation, or in 
the race to win a cup. One of 
these cups is the UEFA Cham-

Machinery hall nearing completion
SEPTEMBER 25, 1913
To Be Occupied Immedi-
ately.
The opening of another 
school year is marked by the 
opening of another building. 
Though not entirely ?nished, 
the enlarged Machinery Hall 
will be occupied immediate-
ly, and will house the electri-
cal engineering department, 
in addition to the mechanical 
engineering department as 
heretofore. The plan of the 
building is very elaborate, 
containing many architectur-
al and engineering features.
The most noticeable of the 
former will be a tower to be 
erected on the central portion 
of the building. The tower 
consists of a series of columns 
in the center of which will be 
a smoke stack. 
Around the stack will 
wind a staircase. From the 
top of the tower a command-
ing view of this entire district 
of the city may be obtained. 
The tower will complete the 
vertical plane of the building, 
planned in contrast to the 
horizontal plane of the De-
sign Building at the opposite 
end of the campus.
The main entrance on the 
east side of the building is 
another of the architectural 
features, and is very impos-
ing. In the basement and on 
the ?rst ?oor are the labora-
tories, the largest of which is 
the electrical laboratory. 
It occupies almost an en-
tire ?oor and is two stories 
high. Between the main sec-
tions of it are two light and 
sound- proof lecture rooms. 
These are well equipped with 
the apparatus required for 
the demonstration of dif?cult 
and accurate experiments. 
The laboratories of the 
mechanical department have 
not been moved, but more 
space has been allotted to 
them, and they have been 
generally improved. On the 
upper ?oors are the recitation 
rooms, which are unusually 
large and well-lighted.
The building, when com-
pleted, will be one of the most 
modern and best equipped 
engineering schools in the 
country.
The following changes 
have been announced, to take 
place at once: In the Science 
Building, the civil engineer-
ing department will occupy 
the rooms formerly taken by 
the machine design depart-
ment; while the latter will be 
moved to the former quarters 
of the electrical engineering 
department. 
Shortly after the opening 
of school, Dean Leete’s of?ces 
will he moved to Machinery 
Hall.

Keeps Closely Posted on 
Pittsburgh-Talks of Schools.
Andrew Carnegie spent 
last Thursday and Friday in 
Washington. During his 24-
hour visit he attended a meet-
ing of the Carnegie Foun-
dation, called at the White 
House with Mrs. Carnegie to 
pay his respects to the Presi-
dent, boomed Senator Elihu 
Root of New York for the presi-
dency in 1916, set a standard 
of simplicity for Jeffersonian 
Democracy by walking to the 
White House from his hotel 
while secretaries, senators 
and many plain people rode in 
carriages and taxicabs, talked 
of his Pittsburgh benefac-
tions, especially the Carnegie 
School of Technology and his 
hopes for the future of the in-
stitution; praised the incom-
ing city administration, let 
his mind wander from Dum-
fernline, Scotland, the town 
of his birth, to Greensburg, 
Pa., where he learned teleg-
raphy, asked questions faster 
than they could be answered,  
and wound up a busy day for a 
man of 78 by attending a din-
ner tonight.
On the subject of Pitts-
burgh, Mr. Carnegie exhibited 
evident enjoyment and his 
memory for names familiar to 
the average Pittsburgher and 
his intimate knowledge of the 
city’s progress were in them-
selves a revelation.
He could anticipate most 
any question and declared 
that he kept in close touch 
with the scenes of his early 
triumphs through his old-time 
friends and by reading the 
newspapers. He said he pro-
posed to go back “home” and 
see for himself the strides that 
have been taken.
The Technical Schools and 
the Margaret Morrison Carne-
gie School for Women seemed 
nearer to the heart of the old 
steel master than any of his 
other benefactions. That the 
schools will receive further ?-
nancial aid from their founder 
could not be doubted and, if 
his enthusiasm can be taken 
us a guide, the big institution 
that overlooks Schenley Park 
and the Oakland district will 
be bountifully remembered 
before the laird closes his 
purse strings for all time.
“What can you say to Pitts-
burgh regarding the Technical 
Schools and, their future?” 
was asked Mr. Carnegie.
“Don’t you think the 
schools speak for them-
selves?” he replied. “It seems 
useless for me to discuss them. 
But I must say I did talk of 
their future with Arthur Ham-
erschlag and Charley Taylor 
in New York last Monday and 
Tuesday. We went over the 
whole situation, and I was 
pleased with what I heard.
“Director Hamerschlag 
told me they would be able 
to accommodate 200 more 
students next year with the 
additional equipment now 
being provided. I’m satis?ed 
that this splendid institution 
will continue to grow and ex-
pand, reaching out after wor-
thy boys and men and equip-
ping them to ?ght the battles 
of life.”
“You know, of course, Mr. 
Carnegie, of the 1,000 poor 
boys who are struggling at 
Tech to get an education, and 
how 758 of them have earned 
$260,422 and continued their 
studies?
“Do I know of these deeds 
of self-sacri?ce?” he replied: 
“Why, of course I do. I know 
what all the boys and girls 
are doing, the same as I know 
what the faculty is doing. 
These boys who labor through 
the day or night and attend 
Technical Schools when they 
can are future presidents, l’ve 
been reading in the Pittsburgh 
papers of one who worked 
three hours a day while the 
others slept, went to school 
eight hours, and put in every 
Saturday at some task which 
yielded him money. But I pre-
dict that that boy won’t do it 
long. The world is patiently 
waiting for such a boy to de-
velop into a man. He’ll climb 
fast once he starts.
“I want you to tell the city 
authorities of Pittsburgh how 
highly we appreciate the help 
that has been extended to the 
Carnegie Library. I note Li-
brarian Craver needs 45,000 
new books for next year to 
meet the demands of students 
and others.”
“They tell me the Council 
has ?xed upon $197,000 for 
the library for 1914, which, I 
believe, is an increase over the 
allowance for the current year. 
I have no complaint to make, 
for I know Council will do the 
proper thing by the library.
Mr. Carnegie while here 
told a story of his recent gift 
of a stained glass window 
to Dunfermline Cathedral, 
which the recipients could not 
accept for the historic edi?ce.
Several years ago Mr. 
Carnegie made up his mind to 
donate a window as a memo-
rial to his father and mother 
and deceased brother and sis-
ter, to be installed in the great 
cathedral. He called in the art-
ists and artisans of the Tiffany 
studio to perform the work, 
and when It was completed 
Mr. Carnegie had the beauti-
ful window shipped across the 
water to Dunfermline. Now 
the municipal guardians of 
the ancient cathedral have re-
fused to accept the gift.
“They came to me,” said 
Mr. Carnegie, “and told me 
that the Tiffany window 
would not do; it was too mod-
ern altogether for the rest of 
the building, which is more 
than 800 years old. I have 
determined to install the win-
dow in the public library of 
Dunfermline. It will be a more 
intimate and personal thing to 
do this for my father instituted 
the ?rst circulating library in 
Dunfermline many years ago. 
The Dunfermline Library was 
the ?rst that I established.” –

Description of Theatre.
The announcement of a 
department of drama has cre-
ated so much interest among 
the residents of Pittsburgh 
and Western Pennsylvania 
that have a leaning toward 
the diversi?ed activities of the 
stage that Prof. Thomas Wood 
Stevens has given a descrip-
tion of the theater and the 
announcement is made of the 
retention of Donald Robert 
son, the pioneer of the mod-
ern repertoire movement, to 
instruct the students in the art 
of acting.
The School of Applied De-
sign, of which the department 
of dramatic art is a part, hous-
es many of the popular activi-
ties of the institute, but none 
is attracting any more favor-
able notice than the possibili-
ties that this course offers was 
opened this week.
The spacious entrance 
to the theater in the Design 
school building, in which one 
Shakespearean production 
will be given each year on the 
birthday of the bard, April 23. 
is from a monumental stone 
vestibule. The seating is all on 
one ?oor. 
The room is elliptical in 
form, the long axis being 62 
feet, parallel with the arch 
and the short axis 56 feet. 
The boxes, at the rear of 
the room, are high enough 
to give the occupants a good 
view of the stage. The organ 
chamber is to the right of the 
stage, opening directly into 
the theater, the organ being 
screened by tapestries.
Fabrics designed in 
keeping with the screening 
occupy the three panels 
to the left of the stage and 
curtain forms part of the 
same decorative scheme. The 
ventilation is through the 
?oor, being under each seat, 
and the exhaust is provided 
in a pierced decorative band 
around the ceiling. From 
?oor to ceiling the walls are 
panelled in straight white oak 
in natural coloring, decorated 
by plaster carvings, and the 
main section with inlay. 
Above the stage the inlay 
has been wrought into an in-
scription “ici l’inspiration de-
ploye ses ailes.” Framing the 
opening are two oak columns 
of monumental size support-
ing the frieze carrying the 
above inscription, with carved 
caps which characterize the 
whole scheme of decoration 
— both for wood and plaster. 
The plaster ceiling forms a 
wide decorative band about 
the opening for a skylight in 
white and amber shades. The 
skylight can be darkened in 
daytime by means of an elec-
trical device. 
The stage, instead of being 
separated from the audience 
space, is reached by a ?ight of 
steps, occupying the full pro-
scenium opening. 
A scene painting gallery is 
located in another part of the 
building, with direct access to 
the stage. The whole of the 
stage ?oor is movable. 
The ?re curtain will be of 
steel and all openings out of 
the stage are provided with 
steel ?re doors, automatic in 
action. The organ has a full 
range, and the console, when 
the organ is not being used, 
can be set back of the movable 
wainscot.

APRIL 29, 1914
Andrew Carnegie will be 
the only speaker at the cele-
bration April 30, of Founder’s 
Day at the Institute which he 
established and which bears 
his name. 
The announcement that 
he will attend the exercises 
has given the celebration an 
unusual interest, and there 
has been an extraordinary 
demand for tickets to such an 
extent that the supply of invi-
tations is already exhausted.
The exercises will begin at 
4 p. m., instead of 2 p. m., as 
heretofore, the later hour hav-
ing been ?xed at the request 
of many business men who 
desire to attend. The commit-
tee has announced the pro-
gram as follows:

Heinroth, there will be one se-
lection played by the orches-
tra from the Carnegie Tech 
Schools, and a choral sung by 
the students of the schools, 
and after that a chorus with 
orchestra accompaniment by 
the instrumental and vocal 
classes together. This is the 
?rst time that the musical tal-
ent of the schools has been 
placed on a Founder’s Day 
program.
The international exhi-
bition of paintings will be 
opened at 6 p. m. on Found-
er’s Day, and is declared by 
the members of the inter-
national jury to be the ?n-
est annual representation 
of modern painting that has 
been gathered together at any 
place in the world.
The museum, will have 
several new groups of animals 
that have been mounted by R. 
H. Santens, the taxidermist, 
besides other interesting ob-
jects to be displayed for the 
?rst time on Founder’s Day.
The day will close with a 
dinner given by the Found-

OCTOBER 16, 1963
On Monday, October 7, 
$1200 worth of photographic 
equipment was stolen from 
the Carnegie Tech yearbook 
of?ce. Most of the equipment 
was owned by the photo editor, 
some by the Tartan. The loss, 
however, was not con?rmed 
until Friday of that week.
The events which led to 
the discovery of the theft be-
gan after a Thistle staff meet-
ing on Monday evening.
Tuesday at noon, Thistle 
editor, Tod Johnson had dif-
?culty ?tting his key in the 
cupboard lock in the year-
book of?ce. Assuming that 
the photo editor had changed 
the lock, he thought nothing 
more of it until he received a 
call the following day from Jim 
Pawley, the photo editor. Jim, 
too, had trouble with the lock 
and similarly thought that Tod 
had changed the lock. 
Since neither of them 
knew of any change in the 
lock, they merely suspected 
that the lock had jammed. 
They forwarded a note to 
Dean Strick to have a mainte-
nance man remove the lock. 
The lock was sent to Dean 
Strick’s of?ce.
Thursday night, when Jim 
returned to the Thistle of?ce, 
he found that most of the 
photographic equipment was 
gone. His ?rst thought was 
that another staff member 
had replaced the equipment 
for safe-keeping, as there was 
no lock on the cabinet. No 
one had any information to 
support his belief.
Friday morning, upon 
questioning the janitor, Jim 
learned that nothing in the 
cabinet had been touched 
since the lock was removed. 
Under these circumstances, it 
became evident that between 
the time of the meeting on 
Monday evening and Tuesday 
noon, the $1,200 worth of 
equipment had been stolen.
It was presumed that the 
door and cupboard locks had 
been picked and that the bur-
glar had substituted a new 
lock on the cupboard, which 
was con?rmed by the dif?-
culty that the two editors en-
countered. 
Dr. Ellis, Dean of Men, 
and Mr. Young, Supervisor of 
the Security Of?ce, were im-
mediately consulted by Jim 
Pawley when he discovered 
that the lock in Dean Strick’s 
of?ce was not the one that he 
had installed.
Later that day, upon Mr. 
Young’s suggestion, the Pitts-
burgh Police were called to 
the school. Detectives record-
ed descriptions of the stolen 
articles, which were veri?ed 
through serial numbers ob-
tained from Jim’s home in 
Ben Lomond, California. 
Some of the items stolen 
were: a Rolli?ex 3.5 Cam-
era ($300), a Nikon F Re?ex 
Camera ($200), a 4x5 Crown 
Graphic Camera, ($200), a 
105 mm. Auto-Nikon Lens

Last Friday had begun as 
any normal day. The weather 
was seasonably pleasant and 
the air was clear. The morning 
gave no foreboding sign that 
by 3:00 in the afternoon, the 
course of history would be so 
determinably altered.
I had one class that morn-
ing, after which I spent some 
time in the library ?nishing 
what little written homework 
I had. The library was the 
scene of usual campus activ-
ity, and the students were as 
earnest in their endeavors 
that day, as any other. Their 
anticipation of the Thanks-
giving vacation only ?ve days 
away was motivation enough 
for a diligent spurt of study-
ing, which I sensed.
 At lunch the students were 
jovial. The noon edition of 
the Pittsburgh Press had noth-
ing of unusual signi?cance 
to report. After lunch I went 
up to the Wherrett Room to 
watch some skiing movies and 
inquire about the Ski Club. 
About twenty people were 
there with me and their inter-
est in the movies was clearly 
evident.
Returning to the Fine Arts 
building I noticed the herd 
of secretaries on their way to 
Skibo to relax on their lunch 
hour. The long lines of stu-
dents were also on their way 
there and I enjoyed seeing it 
as much on Friday as I did on 
any other day.
The afternoon was not sig-
ni?cant in its commencement. 
I chatted with some students 
between 12:30 and 1:45 and 
drafted portions of a design 
which I was slated to present 
the following Monday. At 1:45 
I decided to go to the cashier’s 
of?ce and cash a check. It was 
here that events began to unfurl.
Bulletin Aired at 1:35 
SST
At about 1:35, a bulletin 
had been relayed over the ra-
dio that in the course of Presi-
dent Kennedy’s tour through 
Texas, a sniper had shot both 
the President and the Gover-
nor of that state.
The initial news, trick-
ling in, was scoffed. Word 
of mouth newscasts were 
laughed at and questioned 
as ridiculous. I was in the 
Cashier’s Of?ce when I ?rst 
learned, and it wasn’t by word 
of mouth. 
Before a group of about 12 
students there, the radio had 
presented us with the news. I 
had no time to wonder. I only 
asked myself how serious it all 
could be?
On my return to Fine 
Arts, I heard a very callous 
remark from one student – 
“... occupational hazard.” My 
stomach sank. I felt a horrible 
chill overcome me. It was an 
inexplicable combination of 
fear, hope, and helplessness. 
I waited.
Groups of students sifted 
around transistors and by 
2:00 it was a fact that the 
Thirty-Fitth President of the 
United States had been seri-
ously wounded in assasina-
tion attempt.
The campus was shocked. 
We frantically searched for 
areas where con?rmation of 
the seemingly unreal tragedy 
could be secured.
Back in Fine Arts, ap-
proached a politically-inter-
ested and humanly compas-
sionate classmate of mine, 
(probably out of comfort) 
and asked if he had heard of 
the news. I hadn’t the nerve 
or the composure to plainly 
announce what I had heard, 
perhaps because I still had not 
brought myself to acceptance 
of what I had learned.
His exclamation of surprise 
was enough to draw other stu-
dents around us, and as the 
questions were asked, I felt 
compelled to answer from the 
meager and utterly fantastic 
knowledge that I had acquired 
of the incident.
The area became a center 
of confusion and dismay. The 
time was about 2:45 and ev-
eryone frantically searched 
for a radio. 
There was a very sensible 
reservation of conjectures by 
the students. We all stood in 
shocked silence. One student, 
with a small transistor ra-
dio, glued to his ear, gave the 
crowd of about ?fty students 
the gruesome details.
Although the news of the 
attempted assassination was a 
fact, no one knew of the Presi-
dent’s condition.
My ?rst thought then was 
to seek a source of ?rst-hand 
accurate information. Having 
worked on WRCT, I knew of 
their possession of a United 
Press International teletype 
machine. By 2:50 I was there, 
and with tears in my eyes, I 
read the awful details of the 
tragedy.
Crowd at WRCT
The milling crowd at the 
station was ?xed to that ma-
chine. Their attention was 
unanimous, having been dic-
tated by the events in Dallas, 
Texas, of a fanatic’s blind de-
votion to snuff out the life of 
a man, whose existence dic-
tated our own welfare.
It so deeply affected us, 
not because John Fitzgerald 
Kennedy was the President of 
the United States, but because 
John Fitzgerald Kennedy was 
a humanitarian. His spirit and 
devotion to the cause of man-
kind was only limited by his 
representation of the govern-
ment of the United States. His 
gift in life was an in?nite per-
ception of life — his recogni-
tion that there is as much to be 
learned from what is at one’s 
feet as that which is above 
one’s head. 
The American people saw 
JFK as a President, a human 
being, and an inspiration. The 
seconds ticked away in the ra-
dio station and the fear of the 
loss of this great man grew 
steadily stronger with each 
sound of the clock.
The questions were all the 
same now.
“What’s happening?”
“Did they get the guy?”
“Is he dead?”
Lull Gives Time For 
Thought
WRCT had been monitor-
ing the news broadcasts over 
the CBS network, and the 
teletype had been serving as 
con?rmation and elaboration 
of those details by CBS. 
At about 2:55 there was a 
lull in both of the broadcast-
ing media. 
It gave us a chance to think 
about the future, catch up on 
the details we missed, or to 
strengthen our hopes that it 
wasn’t as serious as we feared.
The only sounds now were 
the incessant clicking of the 
teletype, and the soft whis-
pers of the crowd in the sta-
tion. The next few moments 
brought the ?nal word.
President Kennedy was 
dead. The announcement was 
aired over CBS at about 3:00 
p.m.
I hadn’t been in the station 
when the announcement was 
made. 
I had been in the hall, 
pacing, sipping water at the 
drinking fountain, only in an 
attempt to relieve the twisted 
nervousness that had begun 
to sap my strength. 
My only comfort in hearing 
the words, “He’s dead,” was in 
the assuage of that bewildered 
tension which had clutched 
me not one hour before.
The teletype room was 
still packed with those who 
wouldn’t allow themselves to 
believe what they had heard 
on the radio. 
They wanted to see it in 
print. 
I had that same desire, but 
the tears that fogged my vi-
sion and my thoughts, were 
enough to tell me that the end 
has come and gone.
Upon leaving the radio 
station, I was confronted by 
a student who said, “I never 
liked the guy, but...”
Interrupting him, with in-
dignant sorrow, I said, “You’re 
going to miss him now.”
Campus Reaction to Death of JFK: Shock, Disbelief; Waiting Period Adds Fear, Hope
MARCH 11, 1964
Automatic milk dispensers 
and beverage coolers have 
been installed in the More-
wood Garden’s cafeteria. 
Though residents complain 
that the new milk machines 
limit milk capacity in their 
glasses, the machines are 
actually helpful innovations. 
Unlike the hand operated 
lever machines, these are 
automatic push button types 
which include a tray rack. 
The $900 machines hold two 
?ve gallon cans and consist 
of a refrigerator and pressure 
mechanism.
The lemonade-orange 
beverage coolers provide 
colder drinks than the pre-
viously distributed cartons 
of juice. Girls appreciate the 
additional refrigeration but 
complain that there are no 
longer any cartons of juice to 
take back to their rooms.
Mr. Helm, Director of Food 
Service, explained that, “as the 
number of girls increases, ma-
jor renovations will be made in 
the Morewood Garden’s kitch-
en-cafeteria facilities.”
JANUARY 15, 1964
Planned for Friday, Janu-
ary 17, is the formal opening 
of the new Rare Book and 
Fine Arts’ Floor of the Hunt 
Library. 
While (during the exhibi-
tion of the Plantin Morteus 
Museum) students were ?rst 
introduced to the facilities 
last December, the fourth 
?oor now consolidates all 
reference material (including 
bound magazines) which re-
lates to the representative ?ne 
arts of Carnegie Tech.
This area, originally not in-
tended for use until 1970, was 
planned from donations by an 
anonymous party for the pri-
mary function of housing rare 
books. 
The ?nal designs, with 
inclusion of a complete ?ne 
arts’ reference section, were 
mapped out by Architects 
Warner, Burns, Toan, and 
Lunde of New York City.
The transferred expansion 
of the ?ne arts’ section has 
consequently affected an en-
largement of the Science and 
Engineering Departments on 
the third ?oor. 
It too consolidates all ref-
erence material for the stu-
dents and includes scienti?c 
journals which were previous-
ly shelved in the basement.
There, too, with the 
absence of bound art and 
science magazines, more 
storage space has been 
provided. The remainder of 
shelved periodicals in the 
basement comprises the 
regular stock of humanity and 
other non-art-and-science 
magazines.
With these changes, 
though, perhaps the most 
important concerns the objec-
tive of containment for both 
the third and fourth ?oors. 
To accomplish this, the 
?ne arts’ and the science and 
engineering ?oors now fea-
ture their own complete-card 
catalogues.
Not affected by the li-
brary’s modi?cations are the 
facilities of the second ?oor.
Some of the new conve-
niences which have been 
installed on the fourth ?oor 
Rare Book and Fine Arts’ 
section are music listening 
booths, current magazines on 
vertical displays, and typing 
booths, besides the regular 
stacking of line arts books, 
bound periodicals, records, 
and paintings.
The formal opening, this 
Friday at 4:30 p.m., will be 
limited to invited guests of 
the library staff and adminis-
tration. 
It will culminate a short-
lived yet enthusiastic antici-
pation by both faculty and 
students for the completion of 
the new facilities.

Students, teachers, and passers-by waited in utter disbelief for news of the President’s condition last Friday 
in the Wherrett Room of Skibo. It was a scene that was duplicated in every area on campus, and the feelings 
were the same. Classes were unof?cially dismissed, as all sought word from radio, TV, and newspaper sources, 
which were relating the tragic news directly from the scene in Dallas, Texas.
... the stolen 
articles... 
were veri?ed 
through serial 
numbers 
obtained from 
Jim’s home in 
Ben Lomond,

Planning for Spring Car-
nival 1989 has been under-
way for about two months 
and those involved have had 
some serious problems to 
deal with.
The major problem these 
planners had to face was to 
?nd a new location for Car-
nival. Since the construction 
taking place on campus has 
destroyed the parking lot 
where Midway is tradition-
ally held, there was a need to 
?nd another place that could 
successfully accommodate 
the booths, rides, and people.
The Margaret Morrison 
and Morewood Gardens 
parking lots were two loca-
tions considered by Carnival 
of?cials, but the most recent 
decision was to remain in Sk-
ibo lot with booths and rides 
sharing the space that had 
formerly been used by rides 
and the SDC tent.
According to Spring 
Carnival Chairman David 
Levy, the Margaret Morrison 
lot would have been an ideal 
location, but construction 
planned for next year would 
have meant moving the 
Carnival site again. “At the 
Skibo location, we’re safe 
for a few years at least,” Levy 
commented.
A new location will again 
be needed when construction 
begins on the new University 
Center, now scheduled to be-
gin after the graduation of 
the Class of 1990.
The present layout for 
Carnival will line the booths 
in a W-shaped pattern on the 
section of the Skibo lot pre-
viously occupied by the SDC 
tent and the smaller rides. 
The rides and the Alpha Phi 
Omega concessions would 
be moved to the other half of 
the lot, and the tent would be 
moved to the Cut.
Since the number of 
amusement rides would be 
substantially reduced by this 
arrangement, it may be hard 
for the committee to ?nd an 
amusement company willing 
to bring such a small amount 
of rides to campus. 
“We’re talking to one 
company now. If they 
don’t work out we’ll try 
another one,” said Levy. If 
these negotiations prove 
unsuccessful, it may be 
necessary for planners 
to eliminate the rides 
altogether.
Plans for booth displays 
have been proceeding in a 
more favorable direction, 
but certain restrictions will 
still be necessary. The new 
arrangement of the Carnival 
will limit the number of avail-
able booth lots to thirty or 
thirty-two organizations.
While it is highly unlikely 
that these space constrictions 
will affect organizations who 
already occupy lots, it will be 
much more dif?cult for any 
new organizations to reserve 
space on the Midway.
For the ?rst time in a few 
years, Carnival will also in-
clude a large arts and crafts 
section.
The new area will run par-
allel to Skibo either along the 
parking lot or along the Cut, 
and will include campus or-
ganizations who wish to sell 
things during Carnival.
Anne Witchner, Director 
of Student Activities, will be 
helping the Carnival Com-
mittee with the arts and 
crafts as well as with other 
aspects of Carnival.
The trend of Carnival in 
the past ten years has been 
one of gradual expansion. 
With the construction on 
campus, the entire event will 
become more compact and, 
as Levy pointed out, more 
manageable.
Security problems at 
Carnival are predominantly 
caused by non-University peo-
ple and the smaller nature of 
Carnival will perhaps be safer 
for the campus community.
Though students and ad-
ministrators have been work-
ing for two months, most of 
the planning remains to be 
done for this year’s Carnival.
There will be a need for 
new students to ?ll out com-
mittees, and even a few exec-
utive positions are still empty. 
“We’re looking for people 
who really want to take on a 
challenge,” said Levy.
For people interested 
Spring Carnival, weekly 
meetings are at 9 a.m. on Fri-
day mornings in Skibo Room 
112. 
Levy stated that several 
assistant positions need to 
be ?lled, and, also, stated 
that some executive Carni-
val Committee positions, like 
Entertainment, are currently 
open.
A more general organiza-
tional meeting will be held 
next semester, in January 
and there is the possibility 
of a Winter Activities Fair at 
which students interested 
in Carnival can learn more 
about it.

Construction of the new 
University Center, one of the 
central features of the master 
plan, has been inde?nitely 
delayed due to a lack of funds 
for the building in the Capital 
Campaign.
Paradoxically, however, 
the Capital Campaign itself is 
doing well.
President Richard Cyert 
admits that the main problem 
is that most of the donors who 
are giving to the Campaign 
are earmarking their money 
for other projects. Speci?cally, 
new professorships and other 
educational grants are the 
primary interests — not new 
construction.
The postponement of the 
University Center comes al-
most three semesters after the 
release of the Task Force Re-
port on the Quality of Student 
Life on November 24, 1987.
“Construction of the pro-
posed University Center 
should commence at the earli-
est possible time. The notion 
of the Center ... is one that has 
been embraced almost univer-
sally by the campus communi-
ty,” the report said. “Not only 
are expectations high, but the 
protraction of this project will 
have a chilling effect on all 
other steps ... that are taken 
to enable Carnegie Mellon to 
re?ect the virtually limitless 
potential of its constituency.”
Student Government 
President Andy Robitshek em-
phasized the importance of 
the University Center for stu-
dents. “The University Center 
is the number one concern for 
students,” he said.
The problem with fund-
raising for the University Cen-
ter persists.
“There has been no great 
support for the University 
Center,” said Vice President 
for Development Alvin Bran-
nick about the donations.
Cyert agreed. “The Uni-
versity Center does not have 
strong appeal. That doesn’t 
bother me; we still have to 
keep hammering away.”
According to Brannick, the 
Capital Campaign is currently 
moving ahead of schedule. 
“We’re past the midway mark 
in the Camppaign, at about 
$130 million,” said Brannick.
The fund raisers’ goal, ac-
cording to Brannick, has been 
to get a “prospect” interested 
in giving money, and then 
narrow the focus to a speci?c 
project. He emphasized that 
the University Center is a top 
priority when talking to the 
donors.
Robitshek disagreed, how-
ever. “They say that they need 
a major donor for the University 
Center,” he said, “but they have 
not targeted for a major donor. 
It has not been an emphasis.”
 Cyert projects that the 
Campaign’s goal of $200 mil-
lion will be met by the April 
19, 1991 deadline. So far, the 
needed $30-$35 million for 
the Center is only at about the 
$500,000 mark, according to 
Brannick. 
“We haven’t given up on 
[the Center],” said Cyert. Bran-
nick stated that most of gifts 
have come from sources that 
the Campaign’s organizers did 
not consider at ?rst. “We’re just 
now beginning to start on the 
big prospects,” said Brannick. 
He hopes that with these pros-
pects, large funds directed for 
the Center may be obtained. 
“Our best days are ahead,” he 
commented.
If a separate campaign 
solely for the University Cen-
ter is needed, Brannick proj-
ects that it might be scheduled 
to begin near June 30, 1991, 
after the Capital Campaign 
and at the end of the school’s 
?scal year.
Aside from the major do-
nors wanting their money to 
go to other projects, delays 
and other problems for the 
master plan also stand in the 
way of the University Center.
Brannick said that when 
the University Center plans 
were ?rst being laid out, al-
lowances for housing and 
parking were not taken into 
account. “There have been a 
lot of twists and turns in the 
master plan,” he said.
Brannick admits that the 
new dorm, football ?eld, and 
parking lot have caused prob-
lems for the master plan in 
that it has had to keep expand-
ing its focus. Housing became 
a concern when city residents 
began complaining about 
students living in off-campus 
housing. 
Also, parking, a perennial 
problem at CMU, got even 
tougher when the city further 
limited the school’s access to 
legal parking. 
“We’ve really been dealing 
with eight capital campaigns,” 
said Brannick. “Things would 
be easier if we did not have a 
whole list of [projects].”
Another factor for the Cen-
ter’s delay is the current state 
of construction on the East 
Campus Project. 
“We’re further off schedule 
than we thought we would 
be ?ve or six years ago,” said 
Brannick. “In the course of the 
master plan, the East Campus 
Project must get ?nished,” he 
said.
Even with all of the un-
foreseen problems that have 
hindered the University Cen-
ter and the master plan as 
a whole, Brannick stated, 
“We’ve done very well manag-
ing this type of conglomerate 
[project].” He added that if 
the master plan had kept its 
scope limited, some opportu-
nities to help the school even 
more may have been missed.
Cyert is expected to make 
a formal statement about the 
issue in the next month.
University Center postponed inde?nitely
MARCH 14, 1989
Howdy Pierce
In a week marked with 
resolutions, a petition, and 
anonymous postering, stu-
dent leaders expressed virtu-
ally unanimous dismay at the 
administration’s decision to 
delay construction of the pro-
posed University Center, and 
demanded that higher prior-
ity be given to raising funds 
for the project.
The University Center 
?gures prominently in the 
campus master plan, which 
includes the East Campus 
project currently under con-
struction. Its goal is to unite 
the student body by providing 
a common gathering area for 
recreational and social activi-
ties, as well as increased space 
for activity of?ces.
In late 1987 the Task Force 
Report on the Quality of Stu-
dent Life supported the Center 
as a major effort to improve 
the quality of student life at 
CMU. “The protraction of this 
project will have a chilling ef-
fect on all other steps ... that 
are taken to enable Carnegie 
Mellon to re?ect the virtually 
limitless potential of its con-
stituency,” it said.
Three weeks ago, The Tar-
tan reported that the Univer-
sity Center had been “post-
poned inde?nitely” due to a 
lack of funds for the project, 
expected to cost at least $30 
million.
In an address to the stu-
dent body last Friday, Presi-
dent Richard Cyert claimed 
that “it was not accurate” that 
the student center had been 
postponed inde?nitely, but 
admitted that the administra-
tion would not decide on a 
date to begin construction un-
til the end of the capital cam-
paign in 1991.
“He’s leaving the new 
president in a situation to 
evaluate what the next step 
will be.” Vice President for 
University Relations Don Hale 
told The Tartan. “It hasn’t 
been postponed — I don’t 
know that anybody ever had 
a de?nite date [for beginning 
construction of the University 
Center].”
Student leaders were to 
have met yesterday to discuss 
further student action on the 
issue, according to Student 
Government President Andy 
Robitshek. “We’ll decide what 
to do and that may range from 
nothing to a week-long pro-
test,” he said.
Last week’ activities be-
gan with a petition written by 
Robitshek and Senator Car-
los Franco. The petition was 
?rst circulated at the Tuesday 
Senate meeting, where, said 
Franco, a majority of Sena-
tors signed it. The Robitshek/
Franco petition stated “By 
pushing the date of construc-
tion [of the University Center] 
back ?ve to six years, the ad-
ministration is making a state-
ment that the quality of life is 
no longer a top priority.”
The petition demanded 
that the administration make 
the student center its top pri-
ority, and, if necessary, with-
draw money from the endow-
ment and establish student 
user fees to allow construction 
to begin as soon as possible. 
Robitshek estimated that 400 
students had signed the peti-
tion by press time on Sunday.
Franco also introduced a 
strongly-worded resolution to 
Senate Tuesday asking that 
“the Cyert administration … 
do its utmost to make the Uni-
versity the center of the cur-
rent capital campaign.”
In its ?nal version, the 
Senate resolution does not 
endorse withdrawing mon-
ey from the endowment or 
implementing user fees, al-
though Franco’s version did.
“I’m happy that the resolu-
tion passed,” Franco said. I felt 
that those statements the en-
dowment and user fees were 
necessary to show our resolve, 
but Senate didn’t change the 
meaning much.” On Wedne-
say night, the Student Dor-
mitory Council met and also 
passed a resolution regarding 
the announced delay of the 
student center. “The current 
facilities in Skibo fail to meet 
our growing needs,” said SDC. 
“It is imperative that a new 
university center be construct-
ed as soon as possible.”
The SDC resolution was 
authored by president Bryan 
Wong, Treasurer Matthew 
Fraser, Secretary Amy Sha-
likashvilli, and vice presidents 
Eric Hamilton and Patrick Jef-
?res, Christina Murphy, and 
Dey Hea?tz.
Some time Thursday, 
anonymous advertisements 
for Cyert’s address were pos-
tured across campus. “[Presi-
dent Cyert] plans to announce 
the postponement of the pro-
posed University Center for at 
least the next ?ve years,” the 
poster said. “We’re not going 
to put up with broken prom-
ises anymore.”
On Friday, Cyert addressed 
members of the student body 
in the Wherrett room and 
discussed fundraising for the 
student center. Reading from 
a prepared statement, Cyert 
grouped the University Center 
building and the current East 
campus project as a single 
“University Center Complex.”
The anticipated invest-
ment for the University Center 
Complex … is approximately 
$70 million,” he said. “Half 
the funding ($35 million) 
for this complex has been se-
cured…. The remaining funds 
($35 million) to complete the 
complex will continue to be 
one of the focal points of the 
capital campaign.
But in an interview prior to 
Cyert’s Speech, Vice President 
for Development and Univer-
sity Attorney Alvin P. Brannick 
said that “only $500,000” for 
the student center itself has 
been raised.
Explaining the lack of 
funds for the student center. 
Brannick cited the dif?culties 
involved in raising funds for 
buildings. 
“If I ever had to do it again, 
the one thing I’d never allow 
anybody to do is wrap either 
bricks and mortar around 
an academic campaign or an 
academic campaign around 
bricks and mortar,” he said. 
“People say you can’t raise 
funds for bricks and mortar, 
and I think it’s because of the 
atmosphere you set up.” 
Life Trustee Robert A. 
Charlie, who has worked on 
capital campaigns for build-
ings at both CMU and MIT, 
agreed with Brannick. “The 
University Center is just not 
the kind of thing that attracts 
the average donor,” he told 
The Tartan.
But student critics say the 
reason the administration has 
been unable to raise funds for 
the University Center is the 
priorities it has set. 
“I don’t think they’re push-
ing the University Center as 
their number one priority for 
raising funds, Robitshek said. 
“They’re pushing a package 
deal.”
Both Brannick and Cyert 
admitted that the University 
Center does not have top pri-
ority. “Somebody asked me 
which [project] was number 
one,” said Brannick. “I told 
him that they were all number 
one. They’re the reason I’m 
here.
Cyert also conceded that 
other projects rank equally in 
importance with the Univer-
sity Center. “There isn’t any 
top priority — there’s a series 
of projects.”
Although he admitted his 
of?ce had not given the center 
top priority, Brannick defend-
ed the amount of effort this 
group has expended on the 
campaign. 
“There’s not a fundraiser 
on this project that hasn’t 
worked themselves into a 
frenzy trying to pull the whole 
thing off,” he said. “There’s 
been no lack of effort.”
Most student leaders are 
optimistic about the admin-
istration’s chances for raising 
funds for the University Center 
project if it is given priority. “I 
think the people in the Devel-
opment Of?ce, if guided in the

AUGUST 25, 2003
Andrew Johnson
The grand opening of the 
University Center basement 
facilities on August 29 marks 
the ful?llment of space left 
abandoned since the Center’s 
doors opened in August of 
1996. Initial discussions on 
the renovations began late 
in the fall of 2002, and the 
dialogue’s fruition represents 
a major coup for students, 
whose year 2000 counterparts 
opposed a corporate presence 
in the very same space.
While the big push to get 
the facilities in place started 
with Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy, former Stu-
dent Body President Brian 
Namey said the space was de-
signed by the students and for 
the students. During his presi-
dency last year, Namey led the 
Exploratory Space Task Force 
(ESTF), which was composed 
of students and administra-
tors, to determine a plan for 
renovation that would be 
well-received.
A new rec room, dubbed 
Scotland Yard, includes a va-
riety of table games like pool 
and ping pong, as well as video 
games, from the old school Ga-
laga to the latest craze, Dance 
Dance Revolution (DDR), and 
seems to be up to standards.
“It’s nice. It’s bigger than I 
expected; I was worried when 
I saw the plans,” said Fred 
Merkle, a ?rst-year ECE gradu-
ate student and former Activi-
ties Board chairperson. “Scot-
land Yard is a nice touch.” 
“Every night, there have 
been more and more people 
in the game room,” said Uni-
versity Center Director Marcia 
Gerwig, though she noted that 
it is hard to gauge the popular-
ity of the project with orienta-
tion week being the only metric.
Jason Malatack, a sopho-
more biology major, said he 
likes to play pool and his room-
mate is “all about the DDR.”
“It’s nice just to relax down 
here,” he said.
Andy’s, the new eatery in 
the basement, offers coffee 
drinks, smoothies, and sand-
wiches. In keeping with the 
student-oriented bent of the 
renovations, Andy’s also helps 
to address an ongoing concern 
— a lack of healthy and veg-
etarian dining options on cam-
pus. The non-Dining Services-
af?liated café is the result of a 
proposal submitted by Student 
Activities, the division that 
also runs Skibo Coffeehouse.
“I want to open a coffee-
shop of my own when I retire, 
in a college town of course,” 
said Coordinator of Student 
Activities (SA) Dan Barnett 
who captained the proposal 
and, along with the staff of 
Skibo, designed the menu.
Since a Barnett-driven re-
haul of the Skibo menu, sales 
have tripled, which was a fac-
tor in SA’s submitting a pro-
posal to ?ll the space. Other 
proposals from independent 
companies were also consid-
ered. Skibo, incidentally, also 
had some renovations this 
summer and now includes 
a “cyber-bar” that will allow 
students to surf the web as 
they dine, has installed new 
artwork, and will have live 
music every Wednesday this 
semester. Skibo is used to pre-
pare the food sold at Andy’s, 
though there is little menu 
overlap, said Barnett.
John Hannon, director of 
Student Activities, was in-
volved in the early stages of 
the project and helped guide 
the project during the sum-
mer. He said that it was mirac-
ulous that the space has been 
completed on time. 
“We were on a tight time-
line, so a lot of decisions had 
to be made on the ?y during 
construction,” he said.
First-year business major 
Santiago Guzman also said 
he liked the new facilities, 
though he griped at the costs. 
All of the arcade games, with 
the exception of DDR Extreme 
and a VR-like game called 
Vortek which both run a dol-
lar, cost 50 cents. The digital 
jukebox costs $1 for two plays, 
or $5 for 14 plays.
The original plan would 
have placed the improvements 
on the second ?oor, displacing 
some of the upstairs ?tness ar-
eas to the basement, but after 
further talks and research, the 
ESTF changed the plan to its 
current incarnation.
Stan Krowitz, the Univer-
sity Center administrator who 
can be found walking the halls 
of the UC in the evening, said 
that keeping the ?tness facili-
ties in the open helps to pro-
mote a healthy environment. 
He thinks that students are 
pleased with the construc-
tion, and that the number of 
people enjoying the space has 
grown nearly exponentially 
in the few days that the space 
has been Open to students, as 
he has had to chase more and 
more students out at closing 
each night. The facility will 
be open during the school 
year until 2 a.m. each night, 
though that may change.
The new Career Center, 
which is sharing the same 
space as the new student ar-
eas, is largely outside of Stu-
dent Planning and will later 
be moved to a bigger space, 
pending funding. A new cen-
tralized mailroom is a simi-
larly bundled but also largely 
independent venture of Andy’s 
and the rec space.
While the space is open for 
use, a number of items are still 
on their way, and have already 
been funded, according to 
Student Body President Dan-
iel Gilman. The lounge area 
adjoining Andy’s eatery will 
receive a 42” plasma televi-
sion today that will usually 
run CNN with sound, but will 
also be switched to other pro-
grams that students might be 
interested in watching in the 
evenings, such as Pittsburgh 
Steelers games. Gilman sat on 
the ESTF and worked on the 
project as Namey’s vice-pres-
ident last year. Other tweaks, 
he said, will include bulletin 
boards along the hallway of 
the mail center, new lighting, 
and wall decorations.
In Scotland Yard, the pro-
cess of demand-based tailor-
ing is ongoing, said Gilman. 
For instance, the arcade games 
were chosen using a combina-
tion of student input — DDR is 
popular at CMU, for example 
— and the industry expertise 
of Dale Lazar, who owns the 
company that leases the ma-
chines to CMU and most of 
Pittsburgh. But the machines 
are fair game for change in the 
coming months.
“We’re going to monitor 
things, what’s doing well and 
what’s not,” Gilman said. He 
noted that they had run out of 
sandwiches at Andy’s because 
they underestimated its poten-
tial popularity.
Erlan Barkeltbayev, a ?rst-
year physics student, and his 
checkers partner (Guzman 
both noted that the selection 
in the jukebox is small, and 
Gilman said they are working 
on the student complaint that 
the machine lacks any kind of 
hip-hop selection.
Chris Smoak, AB Chair-
person, has enjoyed a Blast-
ing Blackberry smoothie from 
Andy’s. 
He said that during his 
?rst year at Carnegie Mellon 
in Morewood Gardens, many 
people used the poolroom 
as a place for socializing and 
that the space in the UC would 
have the same effect.
In his ?rst day working at 
Andy’s, third-year creative 
writing student Corey Camp 
said the students loved the 
restaurant, though nearly 
all the customers have been 
?rst-years so far. “An hour ago 
[5:30 pm], we were slammed,” 
he said about the popularity of 
the establishment.
The rec space will also now 
provide a hub for the Safewalk 
program, a student escort ser-
vice for nighttime. The space 
will provide a more interesting 
waiting place than Morewood 
Gardens.
Throughout all stages of 
the planning, revenues to pay 
back funding from the Uni-
versity to create the rec space 
were supposed to come from 
the arcade machines. Dean 
Murphy said, though, that he 
doubts that the machines will 
pay back the loan, but the 
project went forward because 
of backup funding from vari-
ous sources, such as his own 
budget. The total cost of all 
renovations is estimated at 
$2.4 million.
The new recreational, eat-
ing, mail, and career facilities 
now occupy part of a space 
that the University debated 
leasing to Intel for E-com-
merce solution research in the 
fall of 2000. 
The University had not con-
sidered renovating the space 
for lack of funding, and be-
gan to think about leasing the 
space temporarily to Intel, so 
that they could have the reno-
vated space back after three 
to ?ve years when Intel would 
be moved to a permanent 
off-campus location. Though 
the space would have to be 
adapted after that, the main 
costs in heating and ventila-
tion would already have been 
addressed. Students, how-
ever, objected to a corporate 
presence on campus and in a 
building whose mission state-
ment was to provide “facilities 
for teaching and learning that 
may be used by the members 
of the community or external 
organizations whose primary 
purpose is education.”
Intel eventually became 
part of the Panther Hollow 
Initiative and the facility now 
exists on the corner of Forbes 
and Craig.
University President Jared 
Cohon wrote a letter to the 
editor in the October 16, 2000 
issue of The Tartan, acknowl-
edging that the plan wasn’t 
consistent with the long-term 
purposes of the UC but that, as 
a temporary solution, would 
provide many bene?ts to the 
campus community.
Whether or not the ?tness 
facilities belong next to the 
eating facilities as they are in 
the UC is still subject to de-
bate. Junior H&SS student 
Zachary Hiwiller, a Student 
Dormitory Council represen-
tative of Namey’s ESTF, said 
he would rather not exercise 
or swim in plain view of UC 
diners, but the renovations 
project is largely complete, if 
still awaiting a few tweaks. Hi-
willer was in favor of the Intel 
move because he saw it as ben-
e?cial to campus.
“[The ESTF’s] mission was 
to evaluate and re-evaluate 
proposals for the layout of 
the rec/dining space. We ana-
lyzed several proposals, and 
solidi?ed the speci?c vision 
for the space,” stated Namey 
via email. 
He now works for Student 
Affairs until he travels to Ox-
ford to work on his master’s in 
September.

Last Monday, Carnegie Mel-
lon announced the opening of 
its new branch campus located 
in the Persian Gulf country of 
Qatar. The new campus is the 
result of a long-negotiated 
agreement between Carnegie 
Mellon University and the Qa-
tar Foundation for Education, 
Science, and Community De-
velopment, a non-pro?t orga-
nization designed to promote 
education in Qatar.
“We’re very enthusiastic 
about it; it’s a challenge and 
an opportunity,” said Presi-
dent Jared Cohon.
Carnegie Mellon is just 
one of several branches of 
nationally-known universities 
located in Education City, the 
Qatar Foundation’s headquar-
ters. Education City is a de-
veloping 2,400-acre campus 
located in Doha, the nation’s 
capital. The Emir of Qatar, His 
Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin 
Khalifa Al-Thani, and his wife, 
Her Highness Sheikha Mo-
zah Bint Nasser AI-Missned, 
decided to develop the Qatar 
Foundation and its univer-
sity campus in 1995. It is now 
home to branch campuses of 
Texas A&M University, Virgin-
ia Commonwealth University, 
Weill Cornell Medical College, 
and Carnegie Mellon’s branch, 
called Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity in Qatar, will be the 
most recent addition to Edu-
cation City.
Starting in the fall semes-
ter of 2004, Carnegie Mellon 
University in Qatar will be of-
fering undergraduate degrees 
in business administration and 
computer science. According 
to assistant vice president for 
media relations Teresa Thom-
as, Carnegie Mellon University 
in Qatar will continue to enroll 
students in smaller numbers at 
?rst, in accordance with their 
Pittsburgh campus policy.
“It’s always been the Uni-
versity’s intent to have the 
same rules, policies, and stan-
dards at Qatar as it does on our 
main campus,” said Thomas.
Indira Nair, Carnegie Mel-
lon’s vice provost for edu-
cation, currently chairs the 
curriculum committee for 
Carnegie Mellon in Qatar. “My 
main objective was to see that 
what we do there is up to CMU 
standards, as we are offering 
our degrees there,” said Nair.
“It is our hope that this is 
the beginning of a new kind 
of global outreach, a true 
partnership, rather than an 
exchange or ‘visit’, for an un-
dergrad program. Having to 
think carefully about what 
these international students 
need may also give us ideas for 
using some of the techniques 
and resources to better serve 
international students here.” 
Charles E. “Chuck” Thorpe, 
former head of the Robotics 
Institute at Carnegie Mellon, 
has been chosen as dean of 
Carnegie Mellon University in 
Qatar. Thorpe’s international 
experience includes a childhood 
in Belgium and work in the Bel-
gian Congo and Zaire. He agreed 
with Nair, stating in an e-mail 
that students may eventually 
be able to go back and forth be-
tween the campuses.
“I think there is great po-
tential for all kinds of inter-
change. Imagine a class in 
international business, taught 
simultaneously in Pittsburgh 
and Qatar. Students from both 
campuses can work together 
in truly international teams, 
so the exercises become much 
more realistic. Or imagine a 
Pittsburgh CS student who 
would like to spend a year 
abroad, but doesn’t want to 
lose pace with classmates. 
This will be an opportunity 
to go live in a very different 
place, while studying many of 
the same courses as in Pitts-
burgh. And the same is true for 
a Qatari CS major who wants 
to sample life in Pittsburgh.” 
Faculty and staff from Carn-
egie Mellon will also be able to 
teach at the branch campus in 
Qatar in the near future.
“By opening a branch cam-
pus, we will expand the size of 
the overall CMU faculty,” stat-
ed Thorpe. “We will have ac-
cess to more world-class pro-
fessors, in Pittsburgh and in 
Doha, and will be able to have 
distance seminars and courses 
going both directions.”
One of the most important 
goals of establishing the new 
campus, according to those 
involved, is the promotion of 
better understanding between 
nations.” The pragmatic ad-
vantages of having a campus 
in the Middle East are that, 
since 9/11, it has become more 
dif?cult for young Arab men 
to get U.S. visas, and there is a 
resistance on the part of some 
families to have their children 
travel to the US for education,” 
stated Thorpe. “The cultural 
advantages to having branch 
campus are huge: this really 
sends a strong practical mes-
sage that we want to have an 
open dial between very differ-
ent parts of the world. I spent 
the last week in Qatar talking 
with students and of?cials. 
The feedback is very exciting.” 
Indira Nair also looks for-
ward to integrating with Qa-
tar, but warns that Carnegie 
Mellon can’t move fast. “We 
can be enriched, but we have 
to be re?ective, and work with 
integrity to ensure the best of 
education in both places, look-
ing for opportunities for syn-
ergy that would contribute to 
both.”
CMU ?nalizes deal with Qatar; becomes newest addition to Doha
“The cultural advantages to 
having branch campus are huge: 
this really sends a strong practical 
message that we want to have an 
open dial between very different 
parts of the world.”
- Charles Thorpe
After waiting weeks to ?nalize the deal, Carneige Mellon and Qatar ?nally 
come to an agreement for CMU to be incorporated into Education City.

Two weeks ago, the 
world’s largest particle su-
percollider, the Large Hadron 
Collider (LHC), of?cially cel-
ebrated a milestone in its de-
velopment when the ?rst par-
ticle beams were successfully 
accelerated across its 27-mile 
circumference. The real job 
of the LHC is smashing bits of 
our universe together in the 
hopes of discovering new el-
ementary particles — notably 
the elusive Higgs Boson, and 
possible candidates for dark 
matter particles — which may 
help explain how our universe 
holds itself together.
The Higgs Boson is a hith-
erto-undetected elementary 
particle that the Standard 
Model predicts to exist and is 
crucial to explaining why par-
ticles have mass. Dark matter 
is a similarly undetected form 
of matter which is account-
able for nearly 22 percent 
of the unseen mass in space 
holding galaxies together. 
Together, these particles con-
stitute some of the largest 
mysteries in physics today — 
mysteries the LHC may soon 
be able to unravel. The LHC 
essentially accelerates two 
beams of protons to energies 
of over seven trillion electron 
volts (TeV) in opposite direc-
tions, and then points them 
on a collision course. Upon 
impact, the immense energies 
released cause the constitu-
ents of the nuclei to interact, 
releasing elementary parti-
cles in a shower of radiation, 
which lasts for mere nanosec-
onds before decaying. These 
elementary particles created 
during collisions are the fo-
cus of massive amounts of 
research, as they are hoped 
to reveal what is truly at the 
heart of matter itself.
While smashing two clocks 
together may not seem like the 
smartest way to learn how 
clocks work, there appears 
to be little other recourse for 
high-energy physicists to learn 
how our world truly works.
Tom Ferguson, a physics 
professor at CMU, has been 
working on the LHC for over 
14 years, from design to pro-
totype to actual production. 
Currently, Carnegie Mellon 
has a team of 11 members led 
by Ferguson working on the 
LHC, including physics pro-
fessors Helmut Vogel, Manfred 
Paulini, and James Russ, with 
the remainder being post-doc-
toral and graduate students.
Carnegie Mellon’s main 
contribution to the LHC lies in 
the construction of the Com-
pact Muon Solenoid (CMS) 
— a 20-meter long, 18-meter 
high detector built for the spe-
ci?c purpose of detecting mu-
ons, elementary particles pro-
duced both during collisions 
and upon the decay of the col-
lision products. Speci?cally, 
CMU constructed the end-cap 
muon chambers for the CMS 
— massive detector chambers 
which capture trails of muons’ 
as they ?y through matter.
“The ability to detect mu-
ons and meson momentum 
is a crucial part of the CMS,” 
said Vogel, who recently be-
gan working on the CMS as 
a part of Ferguson’s team. 
“Many of the elementary par-
ticles have decay products 
that contain muons, and de-
tecting these muons can give 
us a very good sense of what 
might have been produced in-
side,” he said.
The muon chambers are 
?lled with a mixture of argon 
and carbon dioxide gas. As a 
muon passes through, it ion-
izes gas molecules around it, 
leaving a trail of ionized par-
ticles in its wake.
The freed electrons drift 
to a mesh of high-voltage 
wires strung across the cham-
ber, which convert them into 
electrical pulses that are 
measured and recorded. The 
choice of gas for the muon 
chambers was an interesting 
one. “We could not use a gas 
like, say oxygen, because it 
would be ‘poisonous’ to the 
electrons,” Vogel said. “Oxy-
gen is highly electronega-
tive — meaning the electrons 
would be absorbed before 
they could be detected,” he 
explained. “The gas also 
needs to be non?ammable, 
yet affordable — it is like a 
many-parameter optimiza-
tion problem,” Vogel said.
“We built all the electron-
ics that read out these cham-
bers,” Ferguson said. “There 
is nothing on the market that 
comes even close to the preci-
sion we need for these mea-
surements,” he said. All in all, 
CMU contributed to the fab-
rication of over 10,000 chips 
for 150,000 channels of de-
tectors within the CMS alone.
The analysis team that the 
Carnegie Mellon contingent 
is involved in is currently 
researching a fuller under-
standing of upsilons, which 
are elementary particles that 
have been a subject of inter-
est in high-energy physics for 
several years.
“It is clear we do not fully 
understand upsilon produc-
tion,” Ferguson said. “We 
hope that by boosting to high-
er energies, we may be able 
to discover something new 
about these particles.”
Ferguson likened his work 
to those of chemists in the 
19th century. “[Chemists] 
had all these elements that 
we know the atomic mass, 
the properties and character-
istics of, but we do not know 
why they are there,” he said. 
“After Mendeleev put them in 
a table, he showed there was 
order to the system — and we 
were then able to create new 
elements as predicted by the 
Periodic Table.”
“Similarly, we now have 
these particles like the Higgs 
Boson that are predicted by 
the Standard Model, and we 
are trying to ?nd them within 
these collisions,” Ferguson 
said. “Why are they there? 
What is underlying it all? We 
do not know yet, but we are 
hoping this will be the last 
piece of the puzzle.”
Whether or not the Higgs 
Boson is ever discovered, 
physicists at large are exceed-
ingly excited about the pros-
pects that the LHC brings. 
“Personally, I hope nobody is 
right,” Ferguson said. “I hope 
we discover something no 
one has predicted — now that 
would be exciting!”
Vogel, too, shares his opti-
mism at the prospects of the 
LHC. “We expect to detect 
some intricate signatures or 
event topologies that tell us 
what kind of supersymmet-
ric dark matter candidates 
might have been produced,” 
he said. For a rapper’s ver-
sion of how the LHC oper-
ates, Vogel recommends the 
LHC Rap — which happens 
to be scienti?cally accurate 
— accessible by searching for 
“LHC rap” on YouTube, or at 
the following link: www.msu.

CMU assists in building  Large Hadron Collider
NOVEMBER 3, 2008

Facebook has landed a new 
mapping platform, thanks 
in part to a Carnegie Mellon 
alumnus. Andrew Johnson 
(Tepper ’03) and co-founder 
Anna Hentzel received one of 
Facebook’s ?rst fbFund grants 
for their application Trail-
Behind, mapping software 
people can use to plan hik-
ing trips. While Johnson and 
Hentzel are concentrating on 
hiking now, their software 
has the technical capability to 
map any location in the world.
The grant they received 
is part of the fbFund, begun 
this past July, through which 
Facebook plans to award 
$10 million to application 
developers. Johnson and 
Hentzel’s platform was one 
of 25 to be granted money 
on Oct. 15. They were given 
$25,000 to develop their 
platform and turn it into a 
Facebook application.
“[Anna and I] have been 
thinking of this for a long 
time. We go backpacking ev-
ery or every other weekend,” 
Johnson said. “We’re both 
Facebook users and it was 
always in our plan to make a 
Facebook application.”
Johnson and Hentzel are 
both avid hikers with com-
puter programming back-
grounds. Johnson previously 
worked at the Carnegie Mel-
lon start-up SureLogic while 
Hentzel worked at Google. 
Johnson and Hentzel regis-
tered the company domain, 
(TrailBehind.com), last Octo-
ber, but they really got started 
on the mapping platform this 
April.
TrailBehind will not only 
map trips but will act as a so-
cial platform on which hikers 
can share advice, compare 
paths, offer trail opinions, 
and allow users to map out 
and share particular paths 
they have taken.
Johnson and Hentzel be-
gan with big parks like Yosem-
ite National Park as well as 
areas they were familiar with, 
particularly in Pittsburgh and 
California. They are hoping 
that they and the users can 
expand the coverage.
Steve Schmitt, a member 
of the board of directors 
at TrailBehind, CEO of 
SureLogic, and a Carnegie 
Mellon alumnus (Heinz ’96), 
spoke on the prevalence of 
social networking sites like 
Facebook.
He cited June 2008 sta-
tistics from Comstar, one of 
the major web tracking com-
panies. Out of 860 million 
unique visitors to the Internet, 
580 million went to social net-
working sites, and Facebook 
was by far the most visited.
“What we’re seeing is 
a transformation of how 
people across the globe get 
information,” he said. “CMU 
is part of that story and it is 
very exciting.”
Schmitt, in addition to 
being a CMU alumnus, was 
Johnson’s boss at SureLogic. 
Johnson was Schmitt’s ?rst 
hire and the two worked to-
gether for two years.
Schmitt said Facebook 
is now making the transfor-
mation from a website to a 
platform, adding that it even-
tually will become like an op-
erating system, putting every 
function into one place.
Johnson and Hentzel com-
pared the particular role of 
TrailBehind to a Wikipedia 
of hiking and an interactive 
mapping pinboard, as a place 
where users can collaborate 
on hiking trails, compare 
opinions, and share any in-
sights they have on their past 
trails.
“What makes [TrailBe-
hind] different is that we’re 
aggregating data,” Hentzel 
said. “We have algorithms 
that merge trails between user 
points and rank popularity.” 
Hentzel added that the infor-
mation shared on TrailBehind 
can only be gained from other 
people, not from governmen-
tal or national park websites.
Johnson expressed similar 
sentiments as Hentzel, ad-
dressing the more complete 
and ef?cient nature of Trail-
Behind.
Johnson said that while a 
map of all the national parks 
in the Eastern region of the 
United States could cost about 
$150, a map from TrailBehind 
would be free.
“We know where all 
the parks are and their ba-
sic shapes and sizes. When 
people add information, our 
maps become more com-
plete,” Johnson said.
Johnson spoke excitedly 
of the possibility of eventu-
ally expanding the mapping 
platform to specialize in more 
areas than hiking as the tech-
nical capacity already exists.
“If you want to know about 
where to take your dog, hotels 
that are dog-friendly, ?nding 
malls, or social networks, we 
can help you with that,” John-
son said.
Charles Johnson, Andrew 
Johnson’s father and Man-
aging Member of Verve X3, 
a graphic design ?rm, who 
helped with the software 
development, spoke on the 
challenges TrailBehind will 
face once they expand their 
services.
“We’re talking about com-
peting with companies like 
Google Earth,” Charles John-
son said. “There [are] a lot of 
mapping platforms already 
out there.”
Charles Johnson spoke 
about what sets them apart 
from their competitors.
“This is a more social en-
vironment,” he said. “It’s not 
just getting from Point A to 
Point B, but what to expect 
along the way.”
Charles Johnson said that 
he has already seen a trend 
in people wanting to know 
about the journey, from peo-
ple wanting to know weather 
hour-by-hour to constant traf-
?c updates.
Johnson and Hentzel both 
spoke on the importance of 
their application and on their 
enjoyment of their work.
“For me, the most excit-
ing part is doing something 
I like,” Hentzel said. “We al-
ready use it on our camping 
trips.”
Johnson dreams of the site 
being the top hit on Google 
for mapping of all kinds.
But for now, the focus re-
mains on hiking.
The application, TrailBe-
hind, is available on Face-
book. More information can

A crowd gathered in McCo-
nomy Auditorium last Mon-
day. Composed of Sneaker-
ology 101 students, faculty, 
staff, University of Pittsburgh 
students, and other members 
of the community, the crowd 
waited as Robert “Bobbito” 
Garcia scribbled a series of 
words on the blackboard.
Garcia was the guest lec-
turer brought in by the StuCo 
Sneakerology 101, possibly 
the only class in America that 
has a curriculum covering 
sneakers from Converse to 
Creative Recreations.
The instructors, Carnegie 
Mellon seniors Elliot Curtis, 
a decision science major, and 
Jesse Chorng, an economics 
major, were front row, 
center, ready to receive more 
knowledge.
Before the introductions, 
Curtis said, “This man is a 
legend, a true a?cionado, and 
to have him here is beyond 
amazing. I just want to thank 
everyone who helped to make 
this possible, and continue to 
do what Bob says: ‘expose the 
unexposed.’”
“This is an amazing oppor-
tunity to show everyone what 
we can do and what he has 
done. It will give our students 
some perspective on what El-
liot and I try and teach in the 
classroom,” said Chorng.
When he was done writing 
on the board, Garcia turned 
around, and the text of his T-
shirt read, “Where’d You Get 
Those?: New York’s Sneaker 
Culture from 1967–1980,” the 
title of his September 2003 
book, an anthropological oral 
history that describes the 
functionality and fashion of 
sneakers during this era.
On his feet were the LeBron 
6 sneakers, in navy blue and 
white.
He credited his editors in 
helping him create the book 
used as the text for Sneakerol-
ogy 101.
Garcia, born in 1966 in 
New York City, is also known 
as DJ Cucumberslice, Bobbito 
The Barber, Make It Happen, 
Boogie Bob, Kool Bob Love, 
Soul Food Bob, and Bag of 
Tricks.
After graduating from Wes-
leyan University in 1988 and 
playing professional basket-
ball in Puerto Rico, he began 
working at Def Jam and co-
hosted the Stretch Armstrong 
and Bobbito Show on WKCR 
89.9 FM from 1990 to 1998.
His show featured exclu-
sive demo tapes and in-studio 
freestyles from many then-
unsigned artists, such as Nas, 
Big Pun, Wu-Tang Clan, Big L, 
Fugees, and Notorious B.I.G., 
who later found great success 
on major record labels.
In addition to DJing all over 
the world, Garcia remains an 
editor, writer, cultural critic, 
streetballer, sneakerhead, and 
member of the Rock Steady 
Crew.
Garcia said that a collec-
tor is someone who collects 
sneakers “similar to [the way 
someone would collect] art, 
stamps, or coins.”
He described sneakers as 
a “re?ection of your own per-
sonality,” and said that a “con-
nection with your shoes is a 
connection with others.”
He began a 45-slide Pow-
erPoint presentation that fea-
tured pictures from his book.
Garcia provided facts and 
?gures, prices of pairs, where 
they were sold, relevant ath-
lete endorsements, and in-
formation about why certain 
color combinations claimed 
attention in the public sphere.
He used his slides to ex-
plain the evolution of sneaker 
culture, which featured differ-
ent pairs of shoes and basket-
ball players who contributed 
to this “localized grassroots 
movement of street ball and 
sneaker culture.”
When asked what sur-
prised him about speaking 
at Carnegie Mellon, Garcia 
said, “I’m a humble dude, but 
I didn’t expect to see my face 
big up there on the screen.
“I was shocked. I had seen 
the poster, but man, oh good-
ness. And we’re not in a class-
room; this is an auditorium. 
One-hundred plus people 
were here, and not just CMU,” 
Garcia said.
“I thought we’d be in a 
classroom, you know 30 
people, but this is on a much 
grander scale than I imag-
ined. I knew there would be 
students from the class, but 
people from Pitt and folk from 
the city came out.”
Along with Garcia’s visit 
to the campus, there is other 
evidence of the widespread 
and growing popularity of the 
Sneakerology 101 class.
The StuCo has been picked 
up by many blogs and web-
sites, such as (www.hype-
beast.com), where the class 
and the sneakers are given 
high marks.
A special event, Kicksburgh 
2009, is planned to feature 
the limited edition Sneakerol-
ogy Reebok Reverse Jams, of 
which only 101 will be made 
and sold.
The event kicks off at 5 p.m. 
in Skibo Gym this Wednesday 
and will include live music, 
art, and a break-dancing per-
formance, as well as other 
clothing and sneaker vendors 
and an opportunity to donate 
to The Hill House Association.

AUGUST 26, 2012
Justin McGown
The FBI of?cially indict-
ed Adam Stuart Busby on 
Aug. 22 for sending over 40 
threatening emails to the 
University of Pittsburgh last 
year. Busby’s emails were 
part of a series of over 100 
bomb threats issued to Pitt 
throughout the spring semes-
ter. Busby, the founder of the 
Scottish National Liberation 
Army, is currently in an Irish 
prison awaiting an extradi-
tion hearing for threats he al-
legedly made about airliners 
travelling between London 
and New York City.
According to a statement 
on the FBI’s website, Busby 
is indicted on 35 counts: 
17 counts of wire fraud, 16 
counts of maliciously convey-
ing false information in the 
form of bomb threats, and 
two counts of international 
extortion.
In addition to the Pitt 
bomb threats, Busby has 
been charged with sending 
emails in 2010 threatening to 
poison water supplies in Eng-
land, and speci?cally Gordon 
Brown, who was prime min-
ister of the United Kingdom 
at the time. The 64-year-old 
Scottish nationalist is known 
mainly for his hoaxes; while 
the Scottish National Libera-
tion Army has carried out or 
attempted more overt acts of 
terrorism in the past, Busby 
suffers from multiple sclerosis 
and is bound to a wheelchair.
“I was not in the least bit 
surprised [by the charges],” 
David Leslie, a retired Scot-
tish reporter who personally 
knows Busby, said in a Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette article. 
“His motive is publicity. Bus-
by glories in publicity. He will 
target anyone or any organi-
zation that he feels will gain 
him publicity.”
Busby’s motive is unclear. 
The FBI declined to specu-
late about his reasoning, and 
Busby has no direct connec-
tion to either the university 
or the city. In his interview, 
Leslie told the Post-Gazette 
that it was likely not a deeply 
thought-out action, and was 
possibly inspired by the pres-
ence of a UPMC hospital in 
Dublin.
While the threats Busby 
has been charged with were 
some of the most prominent 
of those made against Pitt, 
nobody has been charged for 
the other threats, including 
the initial ones written in-
side bathrooms on campus. 
Pitt rescinded its offer of a 
$50,000 reward for informa-
tion after a group calling it-
self the “Threateners,” now 
identi?ed as Busby, claimed 
responsibility for some of the 
threats and demanded that 
the reward be removed.
Extradition from Ireland 
is historically hard to accom-
plish, and authorities in both 
the U.S. and the U.K. seem 
to view Busby as a nuisance 
more than anything, accord-
ing to Leslie’s interview with 
the Post-Gazette. The FBI did 
not make any statements re-
garding extradition. Leslie 
believes that the U.S. will 
likely not push hard for Bus-
by’s extradition.
In his of?cial statement, 
Pitt Chancellor Mark Nor-
denberg thanked local and 
federal law enforcement 
as well as the Pitt commu-
nity for their support dur-
ing the bomb threat ?asco. 
He cited examples of people 
who went out of their way to 
help, including a canine of-
?cer from McKeesport who 
made late-night trips on his 
own time to perform bomb 
sweeps, and faculty members 
who patrolled doorways and 
conducted classes on campus 
lawns.
“Everyone in the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh community is 
deeply grateful for the many 
forms of help that were ex-
tended to us while our cam-
pus was under siege and for 
all of the hard work that was 
done,” Nordenberg said in 
the statement.
Although Busby’s indict-
ment has provided some an-
swers, many students remain 
puzzled.
Carnegie Mellon sopho-
more computer science major 
Eric Lee said, “Considering 
that no bombs were actually 
detonated at the school, it 
seems almost ?tting that the 
threats were as random as 
they were pointless.”
Some, like Pitt ?rst-year 
engineering major Erin Saro-
si, are just happy to see prog-
ress. Sarosi applied to Pitt 
while the threats were occur-
ring. “It wasn’t hindering me 
from going here,” Sarosi said. 
“I think it’s still a pretty safe 
campus.”
Suspect in bomb threat case indictedPolaris Moon rover rolled out for Lunar Robot open house
OCTOBER 7, 2012
Jennifer Golda
Pittsburgh-based space 
robotics company Astrobotic 
Technology, Inc. rolled out 
the ?rst prototype of its lunar 
ice prospecting robot, Polaris, 
in the Gates Center at its ?rst 
of?cial public unveiling.
As a part of the Cèilidh 
Weekend festivities, the Lunar 
Robot Open House brought 
students, staff, family, and 
alumni around a stage that 
held Polaris as William “Red” 
Whittaker spoke about the 
rover. A Robotics Institute 
professor and Astrobotic’s 
CEO, Whittaker described 
the goal of Polaris: to explore 
the vast underground water 
and gas resources discovered 
as ice on the Moon two years 
ago.
Polaris, equipped with a 
drill and other prospecting 
equipment, can answer ques-
tions about the gas that satel-
lite data cannot. “What is it, 
what is it made of, where is 
it, what is its concentration, 
can you extract it, can you use 
it?” Whittaker said. “[Polaris] 
changes everything.”
Answering these questions 
could have a large impact on 
the future of space explora-
tion. “This polar ice, when 
utilized, can transform the 
whole direction of space ex-
ploration,” Whittaker said. 
“Because see, if you could re-
fuel after leaving the Earth, 
you can go anywhere.” But to 
learn how to use this extrater-
restrial gas to fuel travel be-
yond our current limits, Whit-
taker explained we must ?rst 
travel to the Moon.
And this will be dif?cult, 
he said, because the rover will 
be completely autonomous. 
Without radio GPS and re-
mote control, the robot will 
have to compare its surround-
ings to satellite images of the 
Moon’s surface to determine 
its location. It will have to see 
and maneuver around rocks 
larger than 15 centimeters —
or roughly the size of a bowl-
ing ball — that could obstruct 
its path. Perhaps the most 
dif?cult challenge is how the 
solar-powered Polaris would 
balance operating in areas 
that not only have ice, but also 
sunlight.
In October 2015, Astro-
botic plans to send Polaris to a 
carefully chosen location near 
the Moon’s northern pole. 
Like the Earth, the Moon’s 
region with the most frozen 
resources is also its coldest 
and darkest: the poles. The 
rover must utilize complex al-
gorithms to predict when and 
where shadows will fall as it 
travels the surface and as the 
Moon changes positions. For 
the mission to be a success, 
the rover needs to detect both 
ice and sunlight.
Polaris also needs to be 
able to successfully land, and 
to achieve this, Astrobotic is 
also developing a high-preci-
sion lander. Once the lander 
and its payload near the de-
sired region of the Moon’s 
surface, it will slow down and 
hover for about four days be-
fore it decides where to land 
and make its slow descent.
In addition to accuracy, 
the lander will also boast 
versatility. Kevin Peterson, a 
Ph.D. student in robotics who 
has worked on the project 
for two years, explained the 
many features of the lander’s 
design.
“... this lander is designed 
for this rover, [but also] for the 
smaller rover and for carrying 
payloads underneath. We 
can go without a rover all 
together, as long as we are 
within our mass constraints, 
which are fairly large, 
actually,” Peterson said. “That 
lets us design one lander 
and then go out and ?nd a 
payload.” This will allow the 
company, which is already 
receiving $1 million a year 
from NASA alone, to easily 
commercialize its lander to 
other Moon-goers.
“The company’s goal is not 
to win the X PRIZE; it is to 
commercialize space,” Aaron 
Acton said, referring to the 
Google Lunar X PRIZE, the 
largest contest of its kind in 
history. 
Acton has been working 
on the project for more than 
three years, ever since he be-
gan his master’s in mechani-
cal engineering. “As part of 
that goal, to win the X PRIZE, 
would be great,” he added.
According to Google’s X 
PRIZE website, “A total of $30 
million in prizes are available 
to the ?rst privately funded 
teams to safely land a robot on 
the surface of the Moon, have 
that robot travel 500 meters 
over the lunar surface, and 
send video, images, and data 
back to the Earth.”
Astrobotic was founded 
shortly after the announce-
ment of the contest in 2008, 
and is determined to compete 
with 26 other groups. With its 
team of over a dozen Carnegie 
Mellon students and alumni, 
the company is preparing to 
move to a new location so that 
it can expand its research and 
operations.

Town hall to discuss CMU’s expansion toward Craig Street
APRIL 29, 2013
Chloe Thompson
Attendees of an open Town 
Hall discussed the fate of Craig 
Street on Wednesday.
Led by Vice President for 
Campus Affairs Michael Mur-
phy, the Town Hall informed 
the audience and the Simonds 
Commission — which is the 
group of trustees, faculty, and 
senior administrators respon-
sible for new projects and ren-
ovations to Carnegie Mellon 
properties — about the devel-
opment plan for Craig Street. 
The Town Hall also served as 
a forum for community mem-
bers to discuss their own opin-
ions on the project.
Carnegie Mellon owns and 
leases several properties in the 
Craig Street area, including 
the recently acquired diocesan 
property near Central Catholic 
High School on Fifth Avenue.
The Institutional Master 
Plan for Carnegie Mellon out-
lines the future development 
of the campus and properties 
held by the university in the 
surrounding area. Murphy 
stressed the university’s desire 
to strike a balance between 
collegiate interests and those 
of the community: “We have 
to have the right mission, the 
right balance, [so Craig Street 
is] CMU-centric and a modern 
destination of choice.”
A possible roadblock in 
the project’s development 
is the zoning designation of 
Carnegie Mellon’s various 
properties. The campus 
falls under an Educational/
Medical/Institutional (EMI) 
zone, which means that the 
university is at much greater 
liberty to do what they like 
with the property. Much of the 
property in the Craig Street 
area is part of a residential or 
business zone, which means 
that the university has to work 
with more restrictions.
Despite these possible con-
straints, Murphy was adamant 
that the university has no 
plans to fundamentally alter 
Craig Street. “We’re not talk-
ing about changing function-
ality, we’re not talking about 
throwing anyone out of their 
place,” he said.
Senior materials science 
and engineering and biomedi-
cal engineering double major 
Sohini Bianka Roy attended 
the meeting as a representa-
tive of the undergraduate 
Student Senate, and discussed 
the stake of students in this 
matter.
“The goal was essentially 
to have some kind of Tartan 
pride,” she said. “When you 
walk down to the University 
of Pittsburgh’s campus, you 
see that ‘Go Panthers,’ you 
see that pride, and we felt 
that Craig Street is kind of like 
our own little corridor street.” 
Murphy then opened the ?oor 
to the audience, asking “What 
is your vision for Craig Street?”
The audience had a wide 
variety of suggestions, such as 
having retailers selling Carn-
egie Mellon merchandise, 
having some Carnival events 
there, or having a visual con-
nection to the school, such as 
painted thistles on sidewalks.
Murphy said that the cur-
rent plan for representation 
of the university was to keep 
symbols “subtle yet iconic.”
Another popular idea was 
asking businesses to stay open 
an hour or two later some 
nights.
As one attendee pointed 
out, “[Craig Street is] a place 
where students could go, but 
then the hours would have to 
match their weeks.”
The idea of closing down 
traf?c on Craig Street to cre-
ate a place for students to con-
gregate was also suggested. 
Director of the Remaking Cit-
ies Institute and member of 
the Simonds Commission Don 
Carter said that the Commis-
sion had investigated this pos-
sibility, but the museums on 
Craig Street needed the space 
to let their patrons exit on the 
weekends. 
The audience consisted of 
mostly faculty, but all were 
clearly passionate about the 
project. Assistant Vice Presi-
dent for Diversity and Equal 
Opportunity Services Everett 
Tademy said, “I’m invested in 
the project because Carnegie 
Mellon is invested in it.”
Director of Facilities Man-
agement Services and profes-
sor of civil and environmental 
engineering Don Coffelt was 
invested in the project as a fac-
ulty member and a resident of 
the Craig Street area.
He expressed enthusiasm 
about the project, saying, “I 
think the only complicating 
factor is it’s going to take time. 
Because it’s complex, and you 
don’t want to get it wrong.... It 
would be harder to ?x if we got 
it wrong than it is to go slowly 
and make sure we get it right.”

The future relationship of Craig Street and Carnegie Mellon opened for 
discussion at last week’s town hall. 
Past student talks stress
MARCH 25, 2013
Oren M. Spiegler
I read with great interest 
of the forum that was con-
ducted on campus pursuant 
to the suicide of a student 
and the issue of the pres-
sure and competitive nature 
of the institution rising to 
the fore.
It is obvious to me that 
nothing has changed at 
Carnegie Mellon since I at-
tended from 1974 through 
1977.
Perhaps my ?rst mis-
take was to have attended 
the school out of a sense 
of duty to my late mother, 
Gloria Siegle Spiegler, a 
distinguished 1943 alum 
from the School of Music, 
who enjoyed a wonderful 
and gratifying career as pi-
ano performer and teacher. 
Mother treasured her days 
at what was then Carnegie 
Tech.
I was accustomed to be-
ing one of the students that 
excelled in elementary and 
high school, but found that 
at Carnegie Mellon, I was 
no longer anything special 
as one forgotten member 
of a group of brilliant indi-
viduals. I was taken aback 
by the lack of individual 
instruction, attending lec-
tures with many times the 
number of students as there 
were in my high school 
classes. It was easy to get 
lost among the masses in 
these huge lecture classes. 
I also had great dif?culty 
in comprehension and ab-
sorption of material deliv-
ered by teaching assistants 
that had poor English skills, 
something to which I was 
not at all accustomed.
I felt that there was little, 
if any, help for the student 
that found the atmosphere 
at Carnegie Mellon to be as 
challenging and intimidat-
ing as I did. 
I went on to attend and 
graduate from Robert Morris 
University with a degree 
in Business Administration 
and to a successful career 
in the public sector which 
continues after almost three 
decades. I have a soft spot 
in my heart for the school 
predicated upon what 
it meant to my beloved 
mother (and I donated 
her two prized pianos to 
Carnegie Mellon upon her 
death in 2005), but CMU 
was not a factor in any of my 
achievements.
“His motive 
is publicity. 
Busby glories 
in publicity. 
He will target 
anyone or any 
organization 
that he feels 
will gain him 
publicity.”

Do you dare play the game?
Game of Thrones begins a promising fourth season
Warning: This article contains spoilers for the first 
episode of season four of Game of Thrones.
The dragons are bigger, the stakes are higher, and 
the numbers become smaller with each episode. 
Season four of the wildly popular Game of Thrones 
premiered Sunday night, and with it came promise 
of a season full of twists, turns, and, of course, 
bloodshed.
Based on the book series A Song of Ice and Fire by 
George R.R. Martin, the hit HBO show is set in the 
fictional continents of Westoros and Essos as their 
inhabitants fight for control of the Iron Throne.
But the road to power and glory is lined with the 
lives of those who were unsuccessful, because when 
you play the game of thrones, you either win or you 
die.
This was a lesson learned the hard way by Robb 
Stark (Richard Madden), his mother Catelyn 
(Michelle Fairley), and his wife Talisa (Oona Chaplin) 
in one of the show’s most gruesome scenes from last 
season, dubbed “The Red Wedding.”
Last season’s finale “Mhysa” saw the fallout from the 
tragedy and brought many of the storylines if not to 
a close, then to a nice pause.
This week’s episode, “Two Swords” picks up 
as King’s Landing is preparing for the wedding 
between King Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and Margaery 
Tyrell (Natalie Dormer).
Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) has his hands 
full dealing with the arrival of the Dornish Prince, 
but not the one they are expecting. Prince Oberyn 
(Pedro Pascal) is there to exact revenge against the 
Lannisters for the death of his sister.
Tyrion’s wife, Sansa (Sophie Turner) is 
understandably struggling after the murder of her 
brother and mother. In a particularly touching scene, 
Tyrion plays the good husband and tries to convince 
her to carry on for the sake of her mother, but to no 
avail.
Her bastard brother Jon Snow (Kit Harington) 
doesn’t have much time to mourn his late half-
brother before he is put before a council of the 
Night’s Watch to answer for his transgressions last 
season.
He’s admitted to his time with the Wildlings, 
especially Ygritte (Rose Leslie), but is upset that his 
brothers don’t seem to believe his warnings of an 
oncoming war from beyond the Wall.
The despicable King Joffrey proved once again that 
he’s more interested in looking like a king than 
actually acting like one, by ignoring his duties and, 
instead, tormenting his uncle Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-
Waldeu).
Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), Mother of 
Dragons, Khaleesi, and one of the most impressive 
characters on the show, continues her mission of 
amassing an army large enough to invade Westoros 
and take back the kingdom she believes is right fully 
hers.
In the meantime, she is beginning to discover that 
even the most devoted mothers cannot always tame 
their children — be they dragons or men.
As can only be expected, it was an episode for the 
viewer to play catch-up, focusing more on laying 
the groundwork for the major storylines this season. 
Although lacking in any major excitement, the 
Game of Thrones season four premiere was the 
perfect episode after a long break

Advice for awkward people
Dear Matt & Ryan,
Carnival! Carnival! 
Carnival! It’s here! I 
thought I’d be moving on 
my sorority’s booth in the 
rain on Friday, but I didn’t! 
Instead I’m just slaved to 
building the damn thing 
for the next 72 hours, 
which is oh so wonderful. 
I can’t wait to watch all 
the happy children climb 
around this carefully 
constructed junge gym 
of fun! Carnival! I’m 
so happy! Sunshine! 
Rainbows! Kittens!
Sincerely,
Unbelievably Naive Into 
Carnival, Operating Really 
No Sleep
Dear UNICORNS,
It is wonderful that you 
are so excited about 
Carnival, we too have been 
checking isitcarnivalyet.com 
constantly for the last two 
weeks. Which is probably 
the reason that we both got 
zeros on our midterms, but 
that doesn’t matter! Spring 
has come again. We will get 
to eat artery-clogging state-
fair food in the Morewood 
parking lot! Both of us have 
been looking forward to 
our last Carnival here at 
Carnegie Mellon, and are 
kinda glad that we don’t 
have to see Carnival moved 
next to the CFA parking lot.
Seriously, a Ferris-wheel 
view of the University 
Center isn’t as cool as 
one of Gates.
Ryan & Matt
Dear Ryan & Matt,
I’m really surprised that 
although both of you are 
seniors, and have plans 
for after graduation, 
you are still as invested 
in everything as you’ve 
ever been! What is your 
secret? I’m dying to know 
so that I can be as good 
a senior as you two next 
year.
Sincerely, 
Nebby, Attached, Student 
Activity Leader
Dear NASAL,
To answer your question, 
the reason that we are 
as good of seniors as we 
were sophomores and 
juniors is that we both really 
want to graduate, and get 
out of here. Don’t get us 
wrong, Carnegie Mellon 
has been a great place to 
get an education, but we 
are ready to do something 
else with our lives. Matt got 
that scuba-diving job, and 
Ryan is eloping with his 
roommate’s girlfriend. As 
such, we both have caught 
a case of senioritis ahead of 
our last Carnival as students, 
and have decided to enjoy 
April in Pittsburgh. This is 
our last advice column. We 
are sorry to no longer be 
able to offer sage advice to 
all you awkward members of 
the Tartan audience, but all 
good things must come to 
an end.
We’ll always live on in 
your memories, however 
terrible our puns were. 
With love,
Matt & Ryan

About Carnival and being a super duper senior

Many School of Drama productions have somber themes 
and leave the audience pondering deep subjects, such 
as the meaning of time or humans’ relationship with 
mortality. Gutenberg! The Musical, however, was a 
breath of fresh air. The acting, as always, was wonderful, 
the sets were simplistic but representative of the tone 
of the production, the story was creative yet easy to 
understand, and the dialogue was absolutely hilarious.
The musical is about Doug Simon, played by junior 
musical theatre major Harron Atkins, and Bud 
Davenport, played by junior musical theatre major Erron 
Crawford, two young and energetic dreamers who have 
written a musical about the inventor of the printing 
press, Johann Gutenberg. Unfortunately, they did not 
realize that there is, ironically, very little historical 
information to be found about Gutenberg. So rather than 
choosing a new topic, they decide to write a historical 
?ction musical and make up the story of how Gutenberg 
invented the printing press.
Bud and Doug perform the play for the audience in 
hopes that there may be a Broadway producer in the 
audience who would like to help put the show on the 
big stage. However, since the ambitious writers are 
young and inexperienced, they do not have a cast or an 
orchestra, so they must play the role of every character. 
Both actors wore baseball hats with the name of their 
character written on the top so the audience could 
always tell who each actor was portraying. Sometimes 
they wore several hats at once and would take them off 
or put them back on to change characters. Another way 
they distinguished between characters was by using 
different accents. However, these accents didn’t always 
make explicit sense. For example, some characters had 
Cockney accents, some had American accents, some 
were just high-pitched, etc. In addition, Bud and Doug 
cannot afford fancy props or sets, so everyday items such 
as cardboard boxes, crates, bicycle pumps, and stuffed 
cats were used as props.
The limited set and the two-man show, along with senior 
biology and music performance double major Angela Lo 
accompanying on the piano, made for quite a spectacle 
and a really funny performance.
The story itself was just as humorous, ?lled with 
characters such as the overly malicious Monk who 
wants to stop Gutenberg from building a printing press 
out of a fear that the commoners might be able to read 
and interpret the Bible for themselves. The Monk has a 
stereotypical henchman at his side, and the two wreak 
havoc throughout the town. The Monk adds another 
source of humor, especially with lines like, “What a 
cute cat! I think I’ll name him Satan. I love Satan.” 
Another memorable character that adds humor to the 
story was Helvetica, Gutenberg’s young, beautiful, 
bodacious assistant who pines for him and despairs over 
unrequited love.
Between scenes, and in place of an intermission, Bud 
and Doug would break character to explain what was 
going on to the audience and give a quick preview of 
what was to come next. This served the purposes of 
allowing them to change scenes, keep the audience 
on the same page, and to add even more humor in the 
dialogue. Also, before the show started, Bud and Doug 
were seen setting up the stage and arguing about where 
to place a line of tape on the ?oor. At ?rst, it was unclear 
if this conversation was part of the show or if it was 
real, but the audience laughed listening to the banter 
between the two characters.
Overall, this production was very enjoyable and de?nitely 
worth the free price of admission. In a particularly 
high-stress time of year with lots of projects and tests 
piling up, Gutenberg! The Musical provided a happy 
distraction. Laughter is de?nitely a great form of stress 
relief, and this production had the audience laughing 
from start to ?nish. The songs were surprisingly 
catchy, the acting spot-on, the story easy to follow 
and understand, and the characters engaging. This 
show proved that a huge cast, an elaborate set, and an 
orchestral score are not necessary for an entertaining 
show, and also spoke to the power of a strong story line.

If you’re one of the three people who doesn’t know the lyrics to “Let It Go,” it might 
be time to check out Frozen, the latest Disney animated feature ?lm that’s been taking 
over the world by winter storm. Elsa (Idina Menzel), princess of Arendelle, has the 
magical ability to create ice and snow. While it seems like a dream come true, Elsa 
resents herself because of the harm she bears to her younger sister, Anna (Kristin 
Bell). Due to Elsa’s fear, she decides to isolate herself from Anna, causing a rift to 
grow between the two sisters. But when the entire kingdom gets cast under Elsa’s ice 
spell, Anna teams up with mountain man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), his reindeer Sven, 
and the magical snowman, Olaf (Josh Gad), to ?nd her sister. In one of the most 
splendid ?lms of the year, Frozen has you singing to the top of your lungs and bawling 
your eyes out at the same time.

Sharknado
Friday, April 11 — 12
Saturday, April 12 — 12
The movie we’ve all been waiting for is ?nally here and we are all alive to be a part 
of this momentous event. Sharknado takes adventure to an entirely new world and 
it’s too good to be true. After a freak hurricane hits Los Angeles, man-eating sharks 
start attacking the city literally by storm. In a desperate attempt to save his wife, bar-
owner Fin (Ian Ziering) gathers together his group of friends to face an impending 
tornado — of sharks. In what is de?nitely on of the most unexpected movies of all 
time, Sharknado manages to toss criticisms aside by making fun of itself within its 
own movie. It’s amazingly fun and fearlessly imaginative and, if you miss it, you might 
regret not being able to tell your grandchildren how awesome it was to be alive 
during the generation of Sharknado.

On Carnival Concerts
I am so underwhelmed and unsurprised by the choice to 
have Mac Miller and Icona Pop play at Carnival this year, I 
can barely get riled up enough to share my opinion.
But this is music, and The Tartan is giving me my very own 
soapbox, so, why don’t I?
I don’t know a lot about Mac Miller, I admit. All I know is 
that he is a rapper, and he is from Pittsburgh. That’s it. 
I know someone who saw him in Squirrel Hill once, and 
everyone was very excited about it.
Despite my limited knowledge of Mac Miller, I do at least 
know everything there is to know about Icona Pop: that 
one song from Girls. Seriously, I’ll go see Icona Pop 
just to watch the change in the crowd from bored and 
uninterested to foamy -mouthed fans when they play that 
one song.
I can think of a ton of artists I would have been jazzed to 
see at Carnival. First of all, Danny Brown would have been 
killer. I know we like to pick rappers for this, so lets get an 
awesome one, right? Old was such a good album, and 
I think it came out recently enough to be relevant. Plus 
he has a song featuring Charli XCX as well, so people 
wouldn’t miss that Icona Pop song too much.
But if we wanted to break the monotony of rap, I’d be 
down to see Empire of the Sun as well. They’re a crowd-
pleaser, like MGMT, except they never released an album 
as personally disappointing as Congratulations was. Plus, 
they have this crazy glam rock, king -of- Neptune thing going 
on. I bet it would be fun as hell to watch.
I’m not pleased with the concert choice, but that’s 
okay. That’s not really all that Carnival is about. It’s 
about people waking up way too early for Buggy, and 
professors canceling class on Wednesday because “none 
of you would come anyway.” It’s about not having to do 
homework! And, in my case, it’s about escaping brie?y to 
Morgantown to see Tobaxxo and The Hood Internet, which 
is going to be gnarly, in the best sense of the word.

So that’s how you met mom?
Long-running CBS series comes to disappointing end
If last Monday’s series ?nale of How I Met Your 
Mother proved anything, it was that the show should 
have ended a long time ago.
Had the beloved CBS sitcom been canceled after 
one, two, or even three seasons, perhaps then 
the ending would have made some semblance of 
sense. But HIMYM was no typical three-season 
?op. It was a sitcom unique in its innovative 
and playful relationship with style, its serialized 
and time-jumping format, and its fearlessness in 
tackling serious issues along with hijinks. Moreover, 
HIMYM was a series with nine seasons to its name 
that endured the marriages, pregnancies, and 
career ?uctuations of its main cast, in addition 
to surviving a serious post-season seven dip in 
quality. Nine seasons of watching meant that 
HIMYM fans experienced nine seasons’ worth of 
plot advancement, character development, and 
emotional buildup. After all that, the HIMYM ?nale 
was nothing short of unacceptable. And it’s almost 
absurdly easy to pinpoint why.
For years, creators and head writers Carter Bays 
and Craig Thomas freely admitted that the ?nale 
was long-planned, the endgame set. There can be 
no better sign than these con?dent assurances that 
they had lost sight not only of fans’ expectations, but 
of what an organic and ful?lling end would entail. 
They failed to consider the nine years of writing that 
had occurred between their conception of the ?nal 
scene and that scene’s unveiling. Bays and Thomas 
were too blinded by their idea of the perfect “full-
circle” ending to realize when that ending was no 
longer applicable.
Almost nothing about the ?nale makes sense when 
placed in context with the rest of the show. For 
starters, season nine is set over the weekend of 
Barney and Robin’s wedding. An entire season is 
devoted to the marriage of a couple — considered 
for years to be HIMYM’s most popular — which the 
writers go on to destroy in less than ten minutes. 
Then, to add insult to injury, seasons of character 
development for Barney — tossed away along with 
his marriage — are reinstated with the lazy insert of 
sudden fatherhood. Lily, career forgotten, is reduced 
to a baby-making machine. Robin, career-consumed, 
closes off, abandoning the gang and the ex-husband 
who was once her best friend. Marshall is perhaps 
the only one who gets off unschated, and the ?nale 
tells us practically nothing about his future that we 
don’t already know.
Ted, however, receives the worst treatment of 
all. Good-guy Ted, eternal romantic Ted, ?nally 
meets his soulmate. The Mother — whose name 
is revealed to be Tracy — is quirky and smart and 
perfect for Ted in pretty much every conceivable 
way. They meet at a train station, and it’s the one 
truly beautiful moment amidst a sea of suck. In that 
moment, and during Ted’s closing speech about how 
he loved Tracy with all that he had for as long as 
they had, it is doubtful there was a dry eye in front of 
screens across America.
But then it got bad. Viewers had been speculating 
for months about the Mother’s death, so the 
con?rmation was hardly shocking. However, only 
the wildest, densest speculators could have guessed 
at the stunt the writers pulled next. After years of 
on-again, off-again, not over it, over it, and a season 
spent making viewers fall in love with Tracy, it turns 
out that the Mother was just one ?nal obstacle in the 
way of Ted and Robin.
The ?nal scene — ?lmed in 2006, before the kids 
could get old — is jarring and irreverent. Ted’s tale of 
“How I Met Your Mother” is really just an elaborate 
ploy to convince his kids to give him the green light 
to chase Robin once again. “Seriously Dad,” the kids 
seem to whine, “stop blabbering on about our dead 
mother and go hook up with Aunt Robin already. We 
all know that’s what you really want.”
Is it, though? Is there a single fan who thought, after 
all this time, that Ted and Robin were genuinely 
meant to be together? That the Mother was just a 
gimmick, one more plot twist at the eleventh hour 
to make the ?nal scene of the last episode echo the 
?nal scene of the ?rst? Judging from the fan and 
critic outrage that has met the HIMYM ?nale, it’s 
hard to believe that anyone wanted this.
What message are we to take from HIMYM now? 
That no matter how long you wait, how much you 
try, and how deeply you love, friendships fade, loved 
ones die, and good things never last? If that’s the 
truth of living, no one is going to be watching what 
was meant to be a light-hearted sitcom to learn it.
Fans came to How I Met Your Mother and stuck with 
it for so long on the promise of a show celebrating 
friendship, love, and life. The ?nale felt like a 
grievous betrayal of that promise, and fans are left 
with a bitter taste in their mouths.

Saturday night saw Rangos Hall in the University Center 
transformed from a dull and unassuming space into 
an electrifying celebration of culture, beauty, fashion, 
and art thanks to the 2014 SPIRIT Fashion Show. Going 
beyond the typical fashion show format to combine 
all forms of performance, the show was more than 
a showcase of clothing, but rather a statement on 
numerous social issues related to discrimination and the 
lingering feelings of hatred that course through the blood 
of America.
The theme for the 2014 SPIRIT Fashion Show was 
“Prima Facie,” Latin for “at a ?rst glance,” and guided 
the show’s discussion of discrimination. As described in 
the program, “Image is powerful and complicated, and 
we want to show the community just how complicated 
it can actually be. Our show will demonstrate the power 
of someone’s ?rst impression.” Indeed, the show’s four 
acts were divided into four sections, each dealing with 
a speci?c theme: “Sexuality” touched on the struggle 
for gay rights and acceptance, “Women” railed against 
unnatural standards of beauty and disregarding strong 
female behavior as “b****y”, “Black Men” dug deep 
into racial discrimination and violence, and “United 
States of America,” the ?rst act of the show, served as 
an introduction to the evening by brie?y mentioning all 
three aforementioned themes.
What sets the SPIRIT Fashion Show apart from other 
events, such as Lunar Gala, is the fact that its much 
more than simply a showcase of clothing. Throughout 
the night, there were numerous performances — spoken, 
sung, and danced — that made “Prima Facie” more 
of an artistic statement than a mere runway. Poems 
performed by junior acting major Mitchell Edwards (who 
also wrote a number of them himself), senior dramaturgy 
major Alesia Etinoff, and junior psychology major Nkem 
Chikwendu gave each section a narrative voice, with 
music and dance performances also serving to highlight 
the themes. Junior musical theatre major Jean Floradin’s 
de?ant dance performance to Bon Iver’s “Lost in the 
Woods,” which provided the close to “Sexuality,” was 
especially powerful in its representation of the spirit of 
the night.
The fashions of “Prima Facie” kept in line with the 
sections in which they were placed. For example, 
“Human,” a collection by Sammi and Company that was 
included in the “Women” section, strives to “remind 
everyone that no matter who we are and what we wear, 
we should be treated and judged like humans, and not 
just as a trend.” Many of the collections showcased in 
“Black Men” were in?uenced by urban streetwear and, 
in keeping with the section’s character, some drew 
inspiration from ?gures who fought against repression. 
“Versus,” for example, included sweatshirts and T-shirts 
that bore the images of everyone from the Notorious 
B.I.G. to Malcolm X and Maya Angelou.
“Prima Facie” was a tremendous effort that transcended 
usual fashion show fare to become a statement on 
incredibly important issues of social justice and equality. 
Rather than celebrating perfection, “Prima Facie” chose 
to rail against it and celebrate beauty and triumph in its 
most true forms. And as an added bonus, the proceeds 
went to fund the Visionary Performing Arts Academy in 
downtown Pittsburgh.

10carnival
pillbox 04.07.14
As the 100th annual Carnival arrives with a 
bang, many on campus are looking back into 
the history of the legendary event. The Spring 
Carnival Committee, headed by senior statistics 
major Emily Hrin and senior lighting design major 
Jackson Gallagher, in particular is bringing back 
an assortment of historical traditions from the early 
years of Carnival.
In researching the history of Carnival, which is 
recognized by most Carnegie Mellon students as 
the best weekend of the academic year, Gallagher 
became interested in the traditions of years past. 
The two that piqued his interest were plank jousting 
and the class chain tradition.
Plank Jousting
Plank jousting was a large part of Carnival from 
1947 to the early 1980s. It involves laying a plank of 
wood across a pit of mud, and then having teams 
of about ?ve people hit each other with pillows 
while balancing on the plank. The goal is to knock 
the opposing team into the mud below. According 
to Gallagher, the mud pit for the event will be 
created in the grassy area near the path by WQED 
off the Morewood parking lot. Teams can sign up 
to participate on the spot, with no preregistration 
needed, and hopefully for free, if feasible. If enough 
teams sign up for the event, the committee plans to 
have a tournament.
Class Chain
The second tradition that the Committee plans to 
revive is the class chain.
From the years 1914–1942, each class forged a link 
of a chain and then stamped it with their class year. 
When World War I started, however, the tradition 
was discontinued. This year, the chain will come out 
of the archives, where it has been stored for years, 
and, after nearly 70 years, be added to once again.
Not only will the class of 2014 be adding a link to 
the chain, but the Carnival Committee will also be 
sponsoring the forging of links for every missing 
class as well.
“Emily and I will be stamping our year into the 
chain,” Gallagher said. Alumni from every year have 
been invited back and will hopefully be available to 
stamp their year into the chain. Gallagher and Hrin 
hope that this tradition that will continue into future 
years as well.
“We’ve also arranged a ‘history of Carnival’ museum-
type exhibit that will be open during UC operation 
hours containing memorabilia from Carnivals past,” 
said Hrin.
At the 100-year landmark, Carnival is thriving, and 
students should take this opportunity to revisit the 
history of the event while enjoying it for themselves.

Brief history of Carnival
1920
First ever Campus Week, including a 
live circus. Sweepstakes is established 
and the Carnival buggy races begin. 
The Campus Queen tradition is 
established.
Alpha Phi Omega begins selling 
concessions on the Midway.
Victor, the 651-pound bear who drinks 
7-Up, comes to Carnival and wrestles 
five fraternity men. All participants lose 
to Victor. 
A week after Google bought YouTube 
for $1.65 billion, The Tartan’s editorial 
page muses on the future of the site 
that, at the time, was serving 100 
million videos per day. That future, five 
years later: bigger numbers. In 2011, 
YouTube is the third-most-visited site 
on the web, serving 2 billion 
videos to 30 percent of the 
world’s internet users each day.
The Pittsburgh City Council has officially declared April 10, 2014 to 
be forever known as “Carnival 100 Day.”
On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, between 4 and 9 p.m., the 
Carnegie Mellon Police Department will be holding a “Dunk-a-
Cop” event on the Midway to benefit the Special Olympics of 
Pennsylvania.
Hypnotist Paul Ramsay will be performing in the Main Tent on 
Saturday at 8 p.m. Ramsay’s performance uses interactive polling 
technology to essentially crowd-source the hypnotism and allow the 
audience to choose what the hypnotized person will do.
