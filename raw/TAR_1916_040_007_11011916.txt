LAWTOCHFRARIE ADMITS 
NEW SOPH MEMBERS
New and O'd Members Meet 
For a Banquet at The 
Schenley
Last Thursday evening the Law- 
tochfrarie Society admitted to mem­
bership ten Sophomores of the Sci­
ence School. The society is an hon­
orary Sophomore Society which each 
year admits ten members of the sec­
ond year class who are chosen be­
cause of their participation in activ­
ities. ; during their Plebe year. This 
year the men elected were P. H. 
Armor, E. P. Bateham, J. D. Beatty, 
George Ellerton, H. A. Kuhn, C. R. 
Little, E. H. Pafenbach, T. C. Per- 
kinson, M. J. Smith and Sylvester 
Williams. 'The initiation of these 
new members was followed by a 
banquet at the Schenley. The toast­
master, J. B. Shumaker, required 
each member present to contribute 
to the program either with a sug­
gestion for the society or with a 
story. If the society is successful 
in following up even a half of the 
suggestions made, it will certainly 
accomplish something for its class 
and school during the coming year.
Lawtochfrarie was founded by ten 
members of the class of 1917; conse­
quently the society now has members 
in each of the upper classes. The 
purpose of the society is to bring to­
gether those men who, during their 
Plebe year, appear willing to sacrifice 
their time for the activities of the 
school, so that during their Sopho­
more year they may combine their 
work and concentrate their efforts. 
A secondary purpose naturally is to 
provide some incentive for -work 
among the Plebes, and to reward 
those who do that work The socie­
ty has the hope of accomplishing 
many things this year, and of doing 
so with perhaps more publicity than 
in the past.

Greenville Gridders Unable to 
Cope With the Heavier 
Tcch Line
THOMAS STARS AT QUARTER
Completely outplayed at every 
angle of the game, the Thiel College 
eleven from Greenville, Pa., suffered 
an unmerciful beating at the hands 
oil the Plaid squad last Saturday aft­
ernoon. Only once did the visitors 
have the ball in Carnegie Tech’s ter­
ritory. Thiel’s linemen were easily 
outweighed twelve pounds to a man, 
while the backlleld broke about even 
in weight.
Coach Steffen had ample opportu­
nity to try out some of his second- 
string men and he took every advan­
tage of it. Grady and Hellstrom were 
the only two regular players left on 
the team when the gong sounded for 
the end of the game. Thomas, playing 
quarterback in the second half, re­
sembled Kesner in his manner oC 
handling the ball and making end 
runs. Although small in stature, he 
Is very fast and cool and the Plaid 
Cans may expect to see him as the 
regular field general next year.
Rupp, Bollinger, Smith and Brun- 
wasser, the substitute backlleld, 
showed up remarkably well. Brun- 
wasser was taken out in the third 
quarter owing to a severe injury to 
his back. It Is hardly possible that 
ho will be able to appear against 
Cornell on noxt Saturday.
It did not occur to the rooters L’or

Glancing at the score by quarters

TARTAN CORNELL TRIP
The result of The Tartan Cornell 
Trip competition proved to be much 
more successful than was anticipated 
by the staff. The competition for the 
best idea submitted to Tlie Tartan 
which would improve Tech was won 
by M. B. Garber, Jr., a Junior in the 
School of Applied Design. Garber won 
the competition over sixty-five com­
petitive ideas.
C. Shumacker and "Red” Merrill 
ran a very close race. The Idea pre­
sented was one which deserves groat 
credit on acount of the inestimable 
value its execution will be to Tech.

will have been made to put it into exe­

CARNEGIE DAY TO BE ON NOVEMBER 24
At a commlttoo mooting hold last 
week, a date was doilnitoly sot for 
Carnegie Day on November 24. Dr. 
Esquerre has charge oil tlio avrango- 
monts and a very fine program is be­

CORNELL EXPECTS EASY WIN
Saturday, November 4, our fast- 
going Plaid eleven travels to Ithaca, 
New York, where they will battle 
with the heavy Cornell eleven on 
Schoelkopf field. The odds seem to 
be in favor of the big Red team, 
but they will meet a team that is 
some team. /
Because of an epidemic of infan­
tile paralysis, Coach A1 Sharpe was 
forced to begin football practice at 
Cornell ten days later than last 
season. But Sharpe has gradually 
worked his huskies into the sem­
blance of his 1915 champions.
The Harvard game, which Cornell 
lost, 23 to 0, gave Cornell her first 
real baptism of fire. Already Coach 
Sharpe has remedied the faults in 
their play. By the time rtlie Itha­
cans meet our own Plaid, he will 
have a powerful machine; not the 
same team that met Howard, but a 
vastly improved one.
Dr. Sharpe has the material to 
make a powerful eleven. He has 
several men equally good fighting

TECH-CORNELL GAME.
The most important event of the 
week and of the season will occur 
next Saturday afternoon at Ithaca, 
when Tech plays the Cornell eleven. 
Duo to the fact that for only the 
second time during the season Tech 
will be able to prosont hor full line­
up, much woli merited interost Is 
occasioned by next Saturday’s evont. 
Wo believe that Toch has a chance, 
not to hold Cornell only to a low 
flooro, but that wo huvo a real 
«¡banco to win. It Booms rather a 
wont oxpondlturo to take such a 
1 rip, but wo strongly suggost that 
ovory trim Toch man who can pos­
sibly find the moans should go. For 
iparnoglo Toch will without a doubt 
display a quality of football which 
no other Tech team has ovor shown 
boforo! Wo aro not saying this, to 
sound onthuslatlc, but wo aro mak­
ing tills prodletlon upon well-found- 
»•d facts.
As a further Induoornont we might, 
mention that tlio University of Cor* 
noil is one of the country's grontost 
educational institutions, and said to 
be the most beautifully locatod 
school In tlio United States. The 
trip is woll worth your while. If 
Wo win is tlioro a man at Toch who 
would not rogret having missed the 
game which will make the Plaid 
famous from coast to coast?
NIGHT SCHOOL NEWS.
A few complaints have come to 
our ears that The Tartan does not 
publish enough news of interest to 
the night students. To begin with 
wo admit this.
We are at all times glad to pub­
lish news of interest to night stu­
dents, but we have unfortunately ex­
perienced great difficulty in secur­
ing such items. Each one of the 
three men's schools annually elects 
a Tartan representative.
Has this been done? If so, whj 
are these night Tartan representa­
tives so silent?
Wo would very gladly devote one 
or two columns each week to the 
night mon. if such articles could be 
secured. So to those night jnen 
who aro complaining wo say—elect 
your Tartan roprosontatlvo, and keep 
him on tlio job. Or if you yoursolf 
liavo somothlng to write mall It to 
Tlio Tartan In care of C. I. T., or 
drop It In tlio school post.offlco.
Such artlclos must bo In our 
¡hands not later than Monday morn­
ing precoding tlio curront issuo.
The editor of the Chronicle Tele­
graph has received an answer to a 
letter which was printed in the Tele 
and which was reprinted in the Tar- 
ton. The letter Is printed below:
To the Editor of
The Chronicle Telegraph:
The first word to you—Is it a joke, 
or did he mean it? I refer, of course, 
to tlio anathema which some name­
less zealot has launched through the 
medium of your paper against sav­
agery and barbarism which prevails 
In our institutions of learning.
It would be a rare pleasure to meet 
and talk with the man who could have 
produced such a discourse. Such a 
sweet, likable nature! I quote—“The 
boys wont to Initiate me, and went to 
take hold of mo, with tlio result that 
the foremost boy nursod a broken and 
dislocatod jaw bone.” Did the man 
speak of savagery?
Permit me to quote again. You ask 
"Is it a Godly tiling, or a proilt-mak- 
ing thing or act to take another man 
and run the risks of making him or 
oven a female an Invalid for life or 
even a cripple?" After careful study, 
I am convinced that the question as 
it stands cannot be answered, for 
there are too many vagaries and ver­
bal sidetracks In It. The question 
lias most wonderful potentialities. It 
might mean almost anything. If I 
am permitted to read into it my inter­
pretation, however, I will attempt to 
furnish the gentleman the Informa­
tion ho requests.
At first glance I construed his 
question as an inquiry into the Godli­
ness or profit of making a man, par­
don me> of taking a man under cer­
tain risks, and miraculously trans­
forming him into a remale invalid. 
Rather stratling, isn’t it? But, elim­
inating the terms "Godly," "profit- 
making,” and "female,” we finally re­
duce the proposition to that of the 
value, justice, and legality of hazing 
—if that is what the respondent 
means by "initiating.”
Next to the spirit of patriotism 
Itself, the feeling of love and rever­
ence which a real college man bears 
toward Ills Alma Mater Is the most 
wonderful Institution of modern life. 
Alma Mater has given him much more 
than a mass of fact and theory, at­
tested by a bit of sheepskin. To her 
he owes those close associations and 
friendships which lie will cherish all 
his life. She has given to him breadth 
of vlow, appreciation of what Is good 
and beautiful, and active and dynamic 
determination to "go In and win,” 
She has1 given him—I can’t write it the 
way I fool it, and I won't try. But all 
true college mon know just what I 
mean, and they know also how Impos­
sible It is to exprosH it. Not the 
studios, I say their valuo Is .un­
doubted. But tlio student life, which 
Is qiilto another thing.
And tlio essential olomont which 
undorllos this student llfo Is "collogo 
tradition.” Rocognlzo tho term? Tra­
dition Is what tho cojlogo Is built 
upon, and without It you huvo but a 
skoloton, without foot, hands, or head, 
Who was It that said, when asltod for 
a definition of a unlvorslty—"Myself 
on ono end of a log, and Mark Hop­
kins on tho other!" Tradition Is tho 
log.
Hazing is a part of this tradition— 
it Is necessary as a means of enforc­
ing tradition upon tho now students, 
commonly called; freshmon. Without 
the benoilclftl effects of this practice, 
it would never be possible to assimi­
late the newer students Into the stu­
dent body. It Is a mistake to suppose 
that cruel and pernicious acts are per­
petrated in this process. Only in 
cases of open defiance of school tradi­
tion is force known.

After the Thiel game the Southern 
Club entertained about sixty of its 
members and friends at a dinner 
dance in the club’s home at 5072 
Forbes street. The house was beau­
tifully decorated with fall leaves, 
Hallowe'en features, and sugar cane 
which E. T. Carey obtained from his 
home in Louisiana. Before dinner 
the guests assembled In the longe 
room where they enjoyed the music 
from the club’s new Vlctrola. Din­
ner was served with a typical South­
ern menu; and as a special feature, 
some of the sugar cane was served 
in the Southern manner. The place 
cards and dance programs were dec­
orated with a Southern scene, de­
signed by F. C. Stone of the Arch­
itectural Department. After dinner 
the tables were cleared away and 
the party danced until midnight. 
There was a representative present 
from each of the various fraternities 
and faculties. Of patrons and pa­
tronesses the following were pres­
ent: Miss Margaret M. Cowley, Dr.
Hamerschlag, Mr. and Mrs. Steffen, 
Mr. and Mrs. Ficheisen, and Mr. and

the story is placed. The services of 
hundreds of extras were enlisted for 
the ensembles. Many of the supers­
titions which still survive in India 
are portrayed and for big effect» a 
native rebellion against the English 
furnishes the thrills.
Wednesday, the attraction at the 
Strand, Forbes and Atwood, is "The 
Iron Woman,” a Metro wonderplay. 
Miss Nance O’Neil, Well known to 
Oaklanders through her connection 
with the Schenley Stock Company,

The story in which Mary Pickford 
makes her first appearance as an in­
dependent star at the head of her 
own producing company is named 
"Less Than the Dust,” and will be 
seen at the Regent, Penn and High­
land, the entire week of November

story of modern India, in which 
Miss Pickford appears as a little 
English castaway who is regarded 
by the natives as actually "less than 
the dust” beneath their feet.
There are nearly fifty Important 
characters In the play. The princi­
pal supporting roles will be played 
by David Powell, Frank Losee, Mary 
Alden, Marie Majeroni, Cesare Gra- 
vina, Francis Joyner, Russell Bas­
sett, Walter Morgan and Mercita Es- 
monde.
In the making of the production no 
expense was spared. A complete

Finlay carried the ball over for a 
touchdown in the first thirty seconds 
of play. Thiel seemed to have no 
effect whatever when the Plaid back- 
field charged down the field with Kes­
ner snugly tucked away behind them. 
Time and again Marshal got away for 
long end runs which soon terminated 
in touchdowns.
Wright's punting and kicking were 
a feature of the game. Every time, 
his punts counted for big gains, while 
his kicks were always beyond the five- 
yard'line. 'Kesner allowed Wright to 
kick the field goals, at which heN 
showed himself quite an adept. Next 
year Tech will undoubtedly depend to 
a great extent on this lad from Lake­
wood to do the “booting.” The game 
in detail:
FIRST QUARTER.
Wright picked to Snyder on the 10- 
yard line. Snyder was tackled before 
he had a chance to run it back. Lahe 
tried right tackle, but could make no 
gain. Jackson, left half, bucked 
through the line for two yards. It 
the fourth down and Lahr dropped 
back to punt.
Finlay Makes First Touchdown.

yard line and by remarkable twist­
ing and turning he cut through the 
Thiel squad to the 10-yard line. Fin­
lay picked up one more yard at left 
end. Marshall added another at right 
tackle, leaving the ball-on the eight- 
yard line. With his mighty stride 
“Nig” carried the pigskin straight 
through the Thiel line. Kesner kicked 
the goal. Score—Tech, 7; Thiel, 0.

with good interference. Wright car­
ried it up the field, but was forced out 
of bounds on the 44. Finlay gained

These will be held in the Fulcrum

BIG CORNELL ELEVEN
REGAINING 1915 FORM
(Continued from Page One.) 
for each position. Both oh the line 
and in the backfield Cornell far out­
weighs Tech. With her wealth of 
first-class substitutes, Cornell can al­
ways replace tired men with fresh 
ones.
At end there is Eckley, who was 
chosen All-America end by many last 
year. At the other end there is 
Zander or Ryerson, high-class per­
formers. At quarter there is the 
mighty Shivericlc, a splendid punter 
and drop kicker. His punts average 
well over 50 yards. He is consid­
ered the equal of any kicker in the 
country. Against Bucknell he drop- 
kicked a goal froni' the 45-yard line. 
At tackles there are Gilles,, Jewett 
and Sutton, large, fast men, who 
charge low and sure. Side by side 
at. guards, are Miller,: Anderson arid 
Taylor, who expect1 to bear the 
brunt of t/Lie Carnegie attack. Carry, 
a. fast protege of Dr. Sharpe, holds 
down the center position. He will 
have to be good to . stop the aggres- 
ive Hellstrom of Tech.-; In Benedict, 
Hoffman and Bretz ,:at halves, and 
Mueller at full, Cornell has a power­
ful well-abalanced backfield.
So far this year Cornell has played 
four, games. The scores were:
Cornell.................26 Gettysburg .... 0
Cornell................42 Williams ............ 0
Cornell.................19 Bucknell ............ 0
Cornell................ 0 Harvard ...........23
It should be distinctly understood 
that Cornell should not ue under­
rated because of the Harvard game. 
Under Coach Haughton, the ever- 
powerfui Crimson aggregation has 
developed into a champion. Due 
consideration must be given the Ith­
acans that they fought on strange 
soil before an immense hostile 
throng. That the Cornellians were 
nervous is shown by their constant 
fumbling and lack of team work. 
Under the lash of &r. Ai Sharpe’s 
tongue the big Red eleven is cor­
recting these faults and when they 
meet the £laid it will be on their 
own grounds before a home crowd. 
It will be altogether a. different prop­
osition. But in Carnegie Tech, Cor­
nell will find a foe worthy of her 
finest steel, in a game that in all 
probability will be undecided till the 
last wlistle blows.
STUDENT ACTIVITIES
BUSINESS SESSION
(Continued From Page One.) 
this meeting the question of inviting 
their membership was considered. It 
was decided to have three M. M. C.
S. representatives on the Board of 
Activities, and fifty per cent of the 
Student Activities fee of that school 
was to be turned over to the Board 
of Activities. This plan met the ap­
proval of all members present.
Mr. Corley asked permission to use 
the Carnegie Union for an inter-fra­
ternity dance, to take place in No­
vember. The request was granted.
There were a few minor discus­
sions before the meeting was ad­
journed. The date for subsequent 
meetings will be the second Wednes­
day of each month'.

Elizabethan Production a 
Great Success
"0 doleful days! O direful, deadly 
«dump! 0 rare Ben Jonnson!” It was 
All this and more—depending entire­
ly on the point of view of the in­
dividual and his connection with 
this unique and much heralded pro­
duction, which had its initial per­
formance Wednesday evenng, Oc­
tober 25, in the theater of the School 
¦ of Applied Design, under the personal 
direction of Mr. William Poel of 
the Elizabethan Stage Society of 
London, England.
That it held the interest of large 
rand discriminating audiences for 
three successive performances proved 
Mr. Pool's skill in adapting so 
lengthy and prosy a play to a mod­
ern audience while still keeping it 
in its proper setting. The artistic

cast showed the same nice sense of 
selection and gives the key to Mr. 
Poel’s success as a producer. Those 
fortunate enough to be present at 
any of the performances, enjoyed a 
rare privilege.
The play was preceded by a con­
cert, after the Elizabethan custom, 
of old English dance times (ar­
ranged for string quartette by J. 
Vick O’Brien, director of the De­
partment of Music), and of songs of 
the same period, sung by three choir 
boys, wearing choristers robes of 
scarlet, white and gold. The effect 
was very quaint and picturesque 
and to many, the concert was a very 
delightful part of the program. The 
string quartette, composed of Miss 
Dorothy Manor, Messrs. Gluck, 
Shakely and Curry of the Depart­
ment of Music, played with their 
usual taste and finish.
With the conclusion of the musical 
program a loud knocking behind the 
scenes riveted attention upon the 
stage with its fombre velvet back­
ground and subdued lighting and 
out of its shadow emerged the most 
impressive dramatic figure in the en­
tire production, "Envy,'’ clad in flow­
ing robes of vivid blue greens which 
threw into high relief the masse of 
Titian hair in which the greenish 
coils of many snakes glekmed, while 
one wound it length about his ex­
tended arm, its head reared and 
fangs protruding. The appeal to the 
imagination was instant and insist­
ent. This is the unforgetable pic­
ture in the play; perhaps more so 
in this case than in any other, owing 
to the fact that Mr. Thomas Filer, 
who read the lines—“Light, I salute 
thee, but with wounded nerves”—is 
one of the "dark people” to whom 
the light of day must forever remain 
a mystery. Mr. Filer is gifted with 
a beautiful voice, deep and rich in 
quality, which he uses with feeling, 
governed by a proper sense of re­
straint.
“Envy” was followed by the “Pro­
logue,” in armor, in the person of 
Miss Mary F. Ricards. Her lines 
were read with ease and carried 
well to the last seat in the house. 
She was well cast in this character 
and her diction reflects credit on 
her instructions, while indicating 
careful preparation on her own part.
Now, the audience having been in­
formed through these two characters, 
what it was all about—the play be­
gan. Herford makes the very per­
tinent statement that "Jonson yield­
ed to the habit of describing instead 
of exhibiting character “and in this 
statement one finds “the reason for 
the ‘Ennui' that is in him” after 
witnessing the third performance. 
By this time all detail has assumed 
its proper place, all stage tricks 
have revealed themselves and one 
is face to face with Ben Jonson, the 
dramatist, of whom Herford again 
says: “Few richer minds than his 
ever created drama; but his talent 
wanted executions and in him we 
miss the intimate divining eye, the 
great illuminatng touch which, in a 
few phrases lays bare all the mys­
teries of personality.”
This observation reveals the diffi­
culties with which the cast had to 
contend and which were, in the 
main, creditably surmounted.
Captain Tucca, Johnson’s most fa­
mous comic character, afforded Mr. 
Arleight Williamson an opportunity 
in an entirely new role and proved 
his versatility. He made the brag­
gart, wheedling coward, a very vital 
character and furnished most of the 
mirth in the play.
“Crispinus (Mr. Frederic McCon­
nell), the perfumed dandy whose 
vanity fed itself upon the foolish 
admiration of stupid women, was a 
most diverting characterization. Mr. 
McConnell's voice proves one of his 
most valuable assets, making many 
roles possible to him, and his duette 
with the melancholy musician Her- 
mogenes (Mr. Joseph Jamison), who 
has a very good tenor voice—was. 
the source of much laughter. In 
the last act Crispinus became real­
ly human, after the dose of helli- 
bore is administered and the general 
laugh attested that the realism 
“struck fire,” even if the literary al­
lusion “missed fire.”
Mr. Frederic Steen, as the citizen 
“Albius,” gave a very interesting in­
terpretation of this foolishly fond 
husband who had taken a gentle­
woman for his wife and paid for the 
honor by enduring innumerable 
snubs cheerfully. His song, “Wake!
our mirth begins to die.” was in his 
own wrords, “most orderiferous
music!”
One of the best—if not the best— 
characterizations was Mr. Howard 
Smith’s “Mare Ordius,” father of the 
poet. He was especially well cast 
and did the best work of his career— 
showing a finish in manner and 
speech that he has never before at­
tained. Mr. Hubbard Kirkpatrick’s 
“Histrio”—was one of the pleasant 
parts in the play. Mr. William 
Viehman made a very satisfactory 
“Asinius Lupus.” Mr. William Mul­
ligan had scant opportunity as “Lu* 
cus,” but made the most of it, as 
he usually does with whatever he 
undertakes. In the character of 
“Orid,” Miss Lucy Barton did very 
acceptable work, and shows marked 
improvement in diction and stage 
presence. There is little action in 
the role and the opportunities of 
which Miss Barton made the most 
are of dramatic readings beginning 
—“and give me stomach to digest 
this law”—and the one in the balcony 
scene—“Banished the court. Let me 
be banished life.” One had to con­
tinually remind oneself that this was 
a satire, in order to reconcile the 
Eaton collar to the character Who 
wore it. It made one suspect “Orid” 
of having gingerbread in his pockets. 
The point appears to have been to 
make “Orid” ridiculous and the end 
was "achieved.” Miss Ravenscroft 
was most fortunately cast as “Tibul­
lus”—possessing both voice and man­
ner suitable to the character. “Cy- 
theris” (Miss Guy) had but one obliga­
tion, to look lovely in a gorgeous 
gown—and the obligation was ful­
filled. Miss Hazel Beck’s “Chloe” 
was the source of much amusement 
and gave evidence of careful work. 
M5ss Lewis made a very stately and 
beautiful “Julia”—and her lines in 
the balcony scene were read with her 
usual, charm. Violante Bollinger’s 
“Augustus Ceasar” was given with 
much dignity and reserve—just a lit­
tle too subdued, one felt. She was 
well cast and wore the magnificent 
velvet robes of Ceasar like one “born 
to the purple.”
Miss Blanche Levy’s “Horace” 
made a most favorable impression, 
as also did Mr. Burke’s “Virgil." Miss 
Kathyrine Jones was well cast as 
“Little Minos” the apothecary. The 
supporting members of the cast wero 
all worthy of mention, but space for­
bids.
The costumes (lent by the Eliza­
bethan State Society) were rich and 
elegant, and by no means the least 
consideration in the production. The 
play was a most auspicious opening 
for this department.

NEW ENGLAND CLUB
FIRST MEETING
Committee Appointed to Ar 
range Club Banquet—Affili­
ation With Pittsburgh Club 
Discussed—A Club House 
Suggested
At 4:30 lust Friday afternoon, some 
fifty students from the new England 
States met in Room 209, Science. 
Plans for a New England house were 
discussed. A committee was appoint­
ed to arrange a banquet and election 
of officers the night of November 9.
There was considerable interest 
manifest at the start, when John 
Touns, temporary chairman, announc­
ed the prospects of the new year. 
Several of the old men have been ac­
tive in shaping new plans, and there 
are excellent chances for a very suc­
cessful season.
Mr. Huber read the minutes of the 
last meeting, w'hich were, very in­
complete. However, interest did not 
lag, for the subject of election of 
new officers was entered for discus­
sion. It was decided to have a New 
England Club banquet on November 
9, and officers are to be elected then. 
To perfect details, Messrs. Wads­
worth, Hiller and Cheswich were ap­
pointed as committeemen. A fee of 
twenty-five cents was assessed each 
member present to give the commit­
tee a working capital.
The matter of affiliating with 
Pittsburgh New England Club was 
suggested, but it was stated that 
any individual member who cared 
to, might attend a banquet of that 
organization on November 4 at Ho­
tel Schenley by consulting Mr. Tar- 
bell.
There being no more urgent busi­
ness, a motion to adjourn was car­
ried and the meeting closed.
CROSS COUNTRY
TRY-OUTS NOV. 4
The regular try-outs for deciding 
what men will represenr. “Tech’’ in 
cross-country this fall will bo hold 
Saturday afternoon, November 4, at 
2 p. m. The course is four and a 
half miles in length and is the samo 
one over which the regular moots 
of the school and also the annual 
P. A. A. championships are run cach 
year.
The first 10 men to finish will 
constitute tho toam that is to repre­
sent the school. Of last year’s toam 
only Lawson, Andrews, Howe and 
De Young remain. These men, with 
Dunsoith and Behtor, who wore 
member of tho 1914 team, are ex­
pected to finish well up towards the 
front.
Dunsoith, it will be remembered, rep­
resented “Tech” in track and cross 
country three years1 previous to last 
year. He was elected captain of tho 
1915 track toam, but was unablo to 
attend school. During the past year 
he represented the Pittsburg Athletic 
Association in a number of meets. 
II© returned to school this fall, how­
ever, and has been of very great 
assistance to Coach Eyman in de­
veloping this year’ cross country 
team.
Of the new men, J. R. Miller, 
Baird, Unzucher, Smith, Watson and 
Henkli have shown very promising 
ability. "Hop” Slater is again out 
and is expected to finish among the 
first. On the whole the outlook is 
very promising and Coach Eyman 
expects a very successful season.
The principle meets this fall are 
the annual P. A. A. meet, the Middle 
Atlantic championships and the dual 
meet with the College of Wooster. 
The date for the latter has not been 
definitely settled as yet, but it will 
probably be at Wooster, Novem­
ber 11.
The try-outs are open to any one 
regardless of the fact, whether or 
not they have been members of the 
squad and Coach Eyman hopes that 
a number of new men will com­
pete.
FRATERNITIES AND CLUBS 
FORM BIBLE CLASSES
Commons Club Organized 
Class Last Week—Others 
Begin This-Week
The Y. M. C. A. workers are meet­
ing rapid success in their plans for 
the formation of Bible classes In the 
fraternities and clubs about school. 
One class was begun last week, three 
others have definitely decided to start 
this week, and still others have their 
plans for organization wel! under way. 
The class already formed is in the 
Conimous Club, an Industries organi­
zation whose house is on Victoria 
street. Last Thursday evening Mr. 
Hartman visited them and gave an in­
troductory Bible talk. It was decided 
to organize permanently for Thursday 
evenings with Mr. Hartman as 
teacher.
Beginning this week, the Sigma 
Tau Fraternity will hold a class every 
Tuesday evening with Prof. Doyle of 
the Science school as teacher. For 
those who do not have the opportunity 
of attending the classes of those vari­
ous' organizations, two more Bible 
study groups are being formed for 
Thursday noon at 12 and 1 o’clock. 
These classes will be in Room 104 of 
Applied Industries and since there is 
one during each lunch period, every­
one will have an opportunity to at­
tend. In addition to these definite 
plans, the Y. M. C. A. workers hope 
to place classes in the dormitories 
and in other boarding houses and 
fraternities. Prospects for classes in 
the Emanon and in the Opheieum are 
particularly bright. The Y. M. C. A. 
is greatly encouraged by the rapidity 
with which their plans are being 
taken up.

SECOND “BAGPIPE” 
APPEARS NEXT WEEK
Industries Publication Gaining 
in Popularity—Advertising 
Feature Causes Increased 
Circulation
The Bagpipe, which Is the official 
organ of the Industrial TScnooJ, will 
be issued on November 8.
Few people other than Industries 
men have known what The Bagpipe 
is, or really stands for. Those few 
have imagined that every ilve cent» 
invested in a copy of The Bagpipe 
was a boost to the Industries Assem­
bly Treasury. Hitherto such has 
been the case; the small amount of 
surplus funds which have accrued 
after expenses were met, were for­
merly used by the Assembly. An 
alteration of policy for this year has 
discontinued that practice. As it 
now stands, all surplus goes to The 
Bagpipe itself, which, in turn, is in­
vested in the improvement of the 
following issue. An example of this 
may bo clearly seen in the fact that 
The I^agpipe now contains twelve 
pages instead of eight, with two 
colors on the front cover. It must 
also be borne in mind that a project 
of this nature entails great expense 
of time and labor; nevertheless, it 
may be assured that no personal 
profit is gained by the publication. 
The work is done entirely by the 
members of The Graphica, who are 
not trying to advertise themselves 
or restrict their efforts to their own 
particular welfare; they are striving 
to compound an organ which voices 
the opinions of the students, and 
push those enterprises which are 
beneficial to Carnegie Tech.
I11 order to expand their circula­
tion, th6y have instituted this meth­
od of advertising various subjects, 
free of charge: One quarter of a
page of The Bagpipe is given to the 
advertiser, in which he may insert 
a display ad for any issue designat­
ed. The only proviso connected 
thereto is that he sell twenty-five 
copieB of The Bagpipe at five cents 
each, in his particular class or 
school. Ho may have t these copie's 
at an agent’s rate of four cents each, 
and keep the extra penny per copy. 
Additional spaco may bo had at the 
same rate.
Astonishing good results were gain­
ed by the Issuo of October 11, tho 
statistics of which may be discussed 
with tho editor, 011 application at the 
Department of Printing.
Four hundred copies of Tho Bag- 
pipe wore printed for the last issue, 
(October 11), some three hundred 
and fifty sains wore made; tho balance 
was distributed to those requesting 
copies after tho salos, and a file of 
but twonty-fivo remains. This Is the 
first Issuo which has boon entirely 
distributed during tho past fiscal 
year. The editors oxpoct a ciroula 
lion of over fivo hundred 011 Novem­
ber 8, among oach of the four 
schools.

FIFTH AVFNUE DORM 
GIVES HALLOWEEN PARTY
On Friday night, October 27, the 
Plobos of Fifth Avenuo Hall gavo a 
Hallowe’en masquerade party for the 
upper classmen. The costumes wore 
original and there wore’many clover 
make-ups.
Tho house was attractively deco­
rated with corn stalks and autumn 
loaves.
Dancing, fortunes and games fur­
nished amusement for tho evening. 
Last of all, tho host oats over, which 
were applos, ginger cakes, pumpkin 
pie, cider and marshmallows, woro 
served.
It was one of the most successful 
parties ever given by the girls of the 
Hall. Credit is surely due to the 
clever ingenuity of the Plebes.

OF INTEREST 
TO THE
VOTERS
IN FIGURING ON YOUR COURSE IN THE 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN TO BE DECIDED 
ON NOVEMBER 7TH—MR. WORKINGMAN— 
YOU SHOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THESE 
POINTS FOR AN INSTANT:
Before the European war started, or rather, in 
the early months of 1914, you did well to work half 
time. That was due to the Underwood or Demo­
cratic Tariff Law.
After this terrible war is over you will have to 
adjust yourselves to half-time again, if the Demo­
crats are successful.
To avoid this condition you must be protected 
from cheap foreign labor. For every $1,000.00 
worth of foreign manufactured material that is 
brought into this country, you lose $500.00 in wages 
—Why? Because you have no protective tariff to 
safeguard you.
The Republican Party stands Four-Square for 
a Protective Tariff. That means protection for 
American industry and American Labor against 
cheap foreign competition.
The friend who helps you while on earth is of 
value—the friend who safeguards your family after 
your death is possibly more valuable. While Gov­
ernor of New York, Mr. Hughes conducted an in­
vestigation of insurance companies and disclosed 
some unfavorable facts. Workingmen buying in­
surance for their families found their foresight had 
come to naught because of mismanagement. Hughes 
corrected that and placed all companies on a solid 
basis.
That one act, performed in the face of great 
and powerful opposition, was the greatest thing 
ever done for labor or any other class in this coun­
try. Ask your wife if this is not so.
Mr. Hughes’ labor record as New York’s Gov­
ernor makes him the greatest friend the working­
man has ever had in public office.
