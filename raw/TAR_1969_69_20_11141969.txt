The New York Rock and Roll Ensemble 
To Play Hard Rock and Baroque Music
The New York Rock and Roll 
Ensemble, clearly the frontrunner 
in the recent trend to combine 
Longhair rock and roll music with 
longhair classical music, will re­
turn to C-MU Thursday. Nov. 20. 
at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. in the Skibo 
Ballroom. The Activities Board is 
sponsoring the group as a result 
of the overwhelming response 
they received when they perform­
ed here last March.
The Ensemble plays what the 
New York Times has termed 'ex­
cellent. ebullient hard rock side 
by side with clean and authorita­
tive baroque music, with graceful 
admixtures in between."’
The five members of the group 
set the mood through costuming, 
in black swallow-tailed jackets 
and bell-bottom trousers, and the 
ruffled collars and cuffs reminis­
cent of old parlor concerts. Elec­
tric organ, guitars and bass, and 
tambourine or cowbell offer the 
percussive drive for rock num­
bers. Two oboes and a cello pro­
vide the dulcet instrumentation 
for such middle baroque compos­
ers as Brescianello.
Three of the group’s musicians 
are students at New York's Jul- 
liard School of Music. Michael Ka- 
men, the electric organist, has 
been called "classical music’s

answer to the one man band.” At 
age 20. he plays piano, clarinet, 
guitar and oboe as well as sings 
and composes.
The NYRRE’s (the group’s ab­
breviated name) drummer. Mar­
ty Fulterman. studied the oboe at 
Julliard and also plays English 
horn, piano and saxophone. For a 
long time Marty believed rock to 
be “hogwash.” but gradually he 
was won over. “But not I find that 
rock is incredibly creative. It 
gives me a chance to perform and 
write things that classical music 
doesn't allow. Classical music has 
come to be frozen. If you play in 
an orchestra, you are a puppet of 
the conductor—not only can he 
come into rehearsal with a head­
ache some day and fire you. if he 
decides to. but you have so little 
chance for expression.-’ Marty 
said.
The third member of the Jul­
liard trio. Dorian Rudnytskv. plays 
bass guitar and cello in the group, 
in addition to the trumpet. French 
horn and piano. Dorian. 25. is the 
keystone member of the group. 
After playing with Cliff and Brian, 
the other two groups members, 
in a group called Invictus in their 
hometown of Toms River. N. J.. 
he went on to Rutgers and Jul­
liard where he met Marty and 
Mike, the classical contingent.
Dorian was trained as a cellist 
in a musical family. His father is 
a conductor and piano teacher, his 
mother is a former opera singer, 
and a brother. Roman, is a con­
cert pianist.
Rounding out the quintet are 
Brian Corrigan and Cliff Nivison. 
"rock" specialists who bring piz­
zazz'' to the group. Brian, who. 
with Mike, is one of the group's
two lead singers, is also its most 
prolific composer and lyricist. 
Speaking of Brian. Michael Kam 
has said. * I'm almost in awe of 
what he can do. He's had no train­
ing. And yet to turn out thet things 
he does, things I couldn't think of 
doing—it turns my head around.”
Cliff, also untrained, plays gui­
tar that is a combination of coun­
try and western, new blues, and. 
as Michael puts it. “some classi­
cal influences picked up just 
through listening.”
The NYRRE has been around as 
a group since the spring of 1967 at 
a Julliard School dance. "Just an­
other teenage hop.” Martv says. 
At the time, they were known as 
Emil and the Detectives. Soon af­
ter. they started playing around 
the New York area and Boston, 
where they were amazed that the 
audience was listening and not 
dancing. Fulterman invented the 
New York Rock and Roll Ensem­
ble name when they decided to 
emphasize their classical music 
abilities.
For a time, they were booked 
for "beautiful people parties” on 
New York's Upper East Side. 
"Actually, it was usually for a lot 
of people trying hard to be beau­
tiful.” said Brian.
But at one. a sophisticated soi­
ree for Leonard Bernstein, they 
got a break. "We were at this res­
taurant called the Running Foot­
man and everybody was very stiff 
about our music.” Kamn remem­
bers. "Then Bernstein got up and 
applauded and came over and 
shook hands, so then they all knew 
it was all right to like us.”
Since then. Bernstein has spon­
sored them on a TV show and the
resulting publicity along with col­
lege concerts and Atlantic record­
ing products have made them fa­
mous.
Tickets for both performances 
will be on sale this week and next 
at the Skibo Information Desk and 
in Baker Hall and the Tartan Grill. 
Allseatsare $1.50.
Senate Finances 'Relative Truth' For 5 Issues
Very little on campus is escaping Student Senate's at­
tention these days. Everything from disciplinary proce­
dures to controversial allocations of funds is receiving 
Senate comment and action.
At the last meeting of the old Senate. November 4. a 
motion was passed (20-0-11 stating that "Whereas any par­
ticipation in a disciplinary process by persons not subject 
themselves to the same disciplinary process violates the 
principles of a democratic justice: We the Student Gov­
ernment of C-MU reassert our conviction that a Universi­
ty Code of Discipline equally applicable to students, fac­
ulty and administrators is the only equitable form of cam­
pus discipline. Further, we state our belief that it the fac­
ulty and administration are not willing to co-operate in 
such a system, any and all disciplinary action against stu­
dents can only be initiated and conducted by the students 
themselves."
In addition, the motion reaffirmed the Senate's feel­
ings and intentions of withdrawing their participation in 
the Conference Committee on Disciplinary Codes, which 
is currently meeting to formulate a new process, unless 
they are given assurances that the point of the above 
mentioned motion wili be implemented. ’
Tfte motion further stated that final ratification of 
any disciplinary (procedure must be hpM through a oam- 
pas-wiée referendum. . v
Asserting their belief that 'althoijgfe 'physical activ­
ity iy q desirable part ot an individual-senile, a one year 
physical education coyfae does «tot in ifsfclf constitute an
important enough contribution to an individual s educa­
tion to warrant it as a requirement for an undergraduate 
degree." the Senate passed a motion < 18-3-0» urging col­
lege councils and other appropriate bodies to abolish the 
requirement, effective with the graduating class of 1970.
Because of the method by which tickets for Dr. von 
Braun's speech were distributed. Senate passed a motion 
(21-1-01 that demanded "a consistent application of pro­
cedures to admit off campus persons to Skibo facilities, 
regardless of what group sponsors the event. Any tempor­
ary relaxation of this regulation must be approved by Stu­
dent Senate."
It was also noted at the Nov. 4 meeting that the Home­
coming Committee lost approximately $1.300 on the week­
end. Since nothing had been appropriated to them, the Ac­
tivities Board will cover the cost.
The new Senate met Tuesday. Nov. 11. At that meet­
ing. Michael Armentrout returned $1.000 of the Thistle ap­
propriation and $1.787.50 was appropriated to the Relative 
Truth for the publication of five issues. The motion was 
passed qa7-8-4) after debate. Frank Puschak challenged 
the necessity of a second campus newspaper. Michael Ar- 
mentroUt replied that the TarUui is not sufficient <*nd that 
he returned the Thistle funds spepificaHy for.the support 
of the Relative Tnrth. « • /. * ''
Jn addition, a $X,060 appropriation was -granted to 
Spring Carrftval. Comments about Spring Carriyal ranged 
from opposition *to the appropriation if UbCne ¥ras not a 
male cotlr( to desire for a theme for the Saturday eight
dance and perhaps abolishment of the midway. Two mo­
tions. one to just give money for firewdrks and the other 
to add fireworks to the budget for the Carnival, were de­
feated.
A motion calling for an increase in the security pa­
trol so that officers will be more readily available was 
passed qa7-7-a).
As of Nov. a5, Mr. Grebos, coordinator of student ac­
tivities. has resigned. Senate passed a motion stating. 
"That the Student Government commends and thanks J. 
David Grebos for his excellent service to the campus com­
munity during the past year as coordinator of student ac­
tivities.”
.It was reported that 600 people voted in the Senate 
elections. A motion was tabled to re-examine campaign 
and election procedures.
A motion requesting the administration to make all 
campus parking available to students during the week 
prior to and including Spring Carnival was tabled. ; .
Complaints were voiced concerning the inconsistent .

Editorial
Goodbye Mr. Grebos
qa David Grebos has resigned from his position as coordina­
tor of student activitiesa We would like to take this opportunity 
to thank him for the time (and overtime) he has devoted to stu­
dents in helping them initiate and design desired programs and 
activitiesa In addition, he has been a invaluable source of infor­
mation and guidance to the Council of Fraternity Presidentsa
We are very sorry to see Mra Grebos leave usa (Who will be 
our one administrator who faithfully attends all Student Senate 
meetings?) We wish him all the best of luck and happiness in his 
new positiona
Discipline A Problem
Student Senate has recently stated its position on discipline 
proceduresa Although we support their basic premise, we urge 
the following considerations to be taken into account by both the 
Senate and the Conference Committee on Disciplinary Codesa
First, it is extremely difficult to clearly and exactly define 
the rights and responsibilities of each constituency, iaea, faculty, 
students and administratorsa In Patrick Cavanagh’s proposal 
qThe Tartan, October 21), for example, the right of free speech 
was defined as pertaining to the student constituency and the 
right of academic freedom was assigned to the facultya Clearly, 
faculty and administrators are entitled to freedom of speech; 
obviously, students are entitled to academic freedoma
Various constituencies also hold different relationships to 
the Universitya For example, faculty and administrators pos­
sess contracts, students do nota
In addition, we hope that in the final process the individual 
element is not lost in a maze of judicial detail and procedurea
We support Student Senate’s motion that the final proposal 
be submitted to the campus community for final ratificationa If 
it does not have wide-spread support, it will be as ineffective as 
current proceduresa

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Closing of Skibo for Homecoming Defended
Editor, The Tartan:
In reply to Ira Purgalin’s letter' 
and the one written by “Dissatis­
fied” criticizing Skibo policy dur­
ing Homecoming, I would like to 
state that it was the intention of 
the Homecoming Committee to 
keep as much of Skibo open as pos­
sible. Previous years have wit­
nessed the closing of the entire 
building even though the Grill was­
n’t being used for any special 
event. I have always been opposed 
to this and until we decided to book 
“Your Father’s Mustache,” just 
before school started, we intended 
to use the cafeteria and keep the 
Grill open. The new booths that 
were installed prohibited this 
plan and we had to use the Grill.
At that time our priorities had 
to be examined. True, Skibo does 
belong to all the students, but it is 
not unreasonable to close it for 
one or two evenings during the en­
tire academic year. It is the ob­
jective of the Activities Board to 
provide entertainment for the en­
tire campus community. Using 
Skibo’s facilities to entertain 1,- 
500 students and their dates is con­
sistent with this policy. It’s a 
rare event indeed when 1,500 stu­
dents are at Skibo on a Friday 
night. In fact, Friday nights at 
Skibo have deteriorated because 
many students won’t go there be­
cause of the number of non-stu­
dents. Most of the people who 
were turned away from Skibo 
were non-students who couldn't 
understand why OUR Homecom­
ing should keep THEM from using 
OUR facilities.
Many students at C-MU use 
their $2,200 tuition as a right to 
demand such things from self-de­
termined curriculum to stealing 
and destroying property to “get 
my money’s worth.” Some of 
these demands are justified, but 
just because you are paid up at 
the cashier’s office does not mean 
that you can do what you want. No 
one applied here because Skibo 
would be open every night. Instead 
your status as a student entitles 
you to participate and formulate 
programs which committees ap­
pointed by the students decide 
upon.
There are numerous quiet 
places to lounge and study in both 
the dorms and academic build­
ings. There are even pool tables 
in Boss Hall. Homecoming was 
using the Ballroom, Wherrett 
room and the Grill. Unfortunate­
ly Skibo does not have much more 
to offer. The real reason that two 
letters have been written is that 
some people wanted to get some­
thing to eat. Since Mr. Purgalin 
lives off campus to begin with. I 
can’t understand why eating 
something other than a Tartan 
Burger for one night would be such 
an inconvience.
The Book Drive
Conducted by mem­
bers of YMCA Philip­
pines Project 1969 . . .
CONTINUES
Donate new and used books 
to rural Filipino schools.
Texts, non-Fiction, Fiction 
wanted.
Bring books to Y Office, 
Room 57, Skibo.
I don't say "tough"' to these 
people who complained. I encour­
age them to work with the differ­
ent groups on campus who are try­
ing to improve our entertainment 
calendar'and plan for new facil­
ities to hold it in. I also say that 
its a discourtesy not to let the per­
son whom you are complaining to
know your identity. The Tartan 
does a disservice by even taking 
up space with such letters.
If the only complaints come 
from people who didn’t attend I 
will have been pleased with the 
outcome.

Economics. ’70
Mellifluous Metaphors
Editor, The Tartan:
It is evident that government of 
the people, by the people, and for 
the people has indeed perished 
from this earth—or at least the US 
part of this earth.
This week we have witnessed 
the spectacle of our government— 
which should be a tool, an exten­
sion of the will of the people—at­
tempting by harrassment to sup­
press a popular expression of sen­
timent, attempting by coercion to 
prevent citizens from legitimate­
ly protesting acts by that govern­
ment.
Amid the mellifluous metaphors 
inanely muttered by our vacuous 
vice-president (leaving one to 
wonder about the "glory that was 
Greece”) and the chancrous 
charges of Transportation Secre­
tary Volpe (who battled a titanic 
traffic tieup to deliver his daft dia- 
trite) there is a hint of serious 
threats of civil rights in America.
The perpetrator of "idealogical 
eunuch’’ and "intellectual snob” 
has also said, "People cannot live 
in a perpetual state of electric 
shock. Tired of a convulsive so­
ciety, they settle for an authori­
tarian society.” and, "We can af­
ford to separate them from our 
society.”
The interpretation of this is 
clear—in the course of his rabid 
ravings this pseudo-statesman has 
been creating an atmosphere for 
government repression of a large 
segment of our population.
This is of vital importance to 
all Americans, regardless of their 
stand on the war and other issues 
for repression of any must be­
come repression of all. Freedom 
of speech must transcend politi­
cal differences.
Be vigilant now—tomorrow may 
be too late.
Steve Jurman
Rotten Pumpkins & Ice Cream
To the Boys of E-Tower:
It has always been generally ac­
cepted that by the time one reach­
es college, one has acquired a lit­
tle bit of maturity and considera­
tion for others. But the events of 
this past quarter have led some of 
us to believe otherwise.
At the time of room drawing 
last year, when we chose to live 
in E-Tower Apartments, we did 
not realize that we had voluntarily 
submitted ourselves to survival 
at the bottom of a garbage pit, or 
"How to Live Comfortably Under 
Three Feet of Crap a Day.’’ As 
much as we all love pumpkins and
paper airplanes—the joys of our 
childhood—there is a time and a 
place for everything. The place for 
a rotten pumpkin or a half-eaten 
ice cream bar is not smashed all 
over our sidewalks. And if you 
boys don’t have anything better to 
do than propel flaming airplanes, 
flaming balls of string, buckets of 
water, and miles of toilet paper 
out your windows. I'm sure that 
we could arrange for your teach­
ers to give you more work. Just let 
us know, we’re buried at the bot­
tom of your infantile rubbish heap.
The Girls

Where's the Drug Survey?
Editor. The Tartan:
The psychology department has 
been working on a drug survey for 
at least a couple of years now. I 
participated in the department's 
survey last year, and was inform­
ed at that time that results of 
the study would be made known to
the student body. I am not aware 
that the student body has been so 
informed. At what stage is the 
analysis, and when will we learn 
of its results?
Dale Partin 
Class of ’71
Floorshow?
Editor. The Tartan:
What happened to the proposal 
that ID s be checked in Skibo. It's 
bad enough eating Skibo’s food but 
digesting it with the colored high 
school students jumping around in 
front of the juke box is too much 
to stomach. Besides taking up 
space, they don’t add any class to 
our snack bar. Whev doesn't se­
curity remove this floor show or 
at least check ID s?
Frederick
Race Relations
Editor. The Tartan:
Thank you for the invitation to 
witness a very talented and spec­
tacular program Friday night.
To the dismay of those involved, 
however, hostile factions openly 
intimidated and harrassed mem­
bers of the audience, mainly stu­
dents of C-MU.
It would be unfortunate if the 
young people afflicted concluded 
that unpleasantness is the sum to­
tal of race relations.

Student Activities Chief 
Resigns From Position
Clark Calls This Stage 
rrGood Idea All Along’
Leaving C-MU today is J. Da­
vid Grebos, director of student ac­
tivities. Mr. Grebos has resigned 
his position in order to become 
program director at Jefferson 
University.
A graduate of C-MU, Mr. Gre­
bos has worked with students in 
planning various activities rang­
ing from Homecoming Weekend 
and Spring Carnival to TGIF 
dances. During his stay here Mr. 
Grebos worked also as a “master 
bookkeeper,” executing student 
organization budgets as they are 
allocated by the Student Govern­
ment. A ready source of informa­
tion for students planning various 
activities such as dances, guest 
speakers, dinners, etc., Mr. Gre­
bos also provided information on 
the problems and pitfalls encoun­
tered by different groups in the 
past, in an effort to avoid the 
same problems again and again.
When asked whether he sensed 
any trends or diffeient directions 
forming within the area of stu­
dent activities, Mr. Grebos felt 
that there may exist a general 
trend away from the “traditional 
type” of student activity. “Stu­
dents no longer will initiate an ac­
tivity just because it has always 
been done in the past. They want 
something new and unique.” He 
added that although he did not 
think students would abandon the 
idea of Homecoming or Spring 
Carnival in the immediate future. 
“There may be a very different 
approach to the overall general 
programming of such events in 
the near future.”
Asked if there were any speci­
fic reason for his resignation. Mr. 
Grebos replied that there was no 
opportunity for promotion in the 
position he now holds. “It's just 
the same reason anybody switches 
jobs, they want to get ahead. "
"For 40 years, I have talked 
about space to anyone who would 
listen and I have seen the reactions 
of my words pass through three 
stages. At first, it was considered 
utter nonsense. In the second 
stage it was considered possible 
—but not worth doing. And the 
third stage, which we are just en­
tering, believes that it was a good 
idea all along.”
Arthur C. Clark, noted co-au­
thor of 2001 and a man who has 
been actively interested in space 
for many years, addressed the 
campus on Tuesday at 11:30 a.m. 
in the Ballroom. His lecture was 
structured in two parts. He be­
gan by talking about the service 
satellites program, including na­
vigational. meteorological, and 
reconnaissence systems. He then 
discussed the possibilities that the 
space exploration programs would 
open up in the future.
It was his expressed hope that 
his discussion of the beneficial as­
pects of the satellite and manned- 
exploration programs would help 
to answer the reasonable ques­
tion of why do we spend so much 
money on future possibilities 
when it could be spent to improve 
conditions such as housing and 
pollution that exist and threaten 
the world now.
The navigational satellite pro­
gram is already having a revolu­
tionary effect on oceanography. 
Ships can now pinpoint their posi­
tion at any time of the day without 
having to rely on the moon and 
stars which are not always visi­
ble. This will soon be applied to 
aircraft. This accuracy in posi­
tioning will mean that collisions 
can be avoided and many lives will 
be saved. It will eventually mean 
that airport size can be lessened, 
thus freeing land for other uses. 
These changes will affect every­
one.
The meteorological satellites 
have brought increasing accuracy 
to weather forecasting, and it will 
soon be possible to accurately 
predict weather conditions two 
and three days in advance. We are 
coming to relv more and more on 
the vagaries of weather, accurate 
forecasting will enable us to pre­
pare. “For instance. Camille, one 
of the worst hurricanes in recent 
decades, took a toll of several 
hundred lives. Not too long ago.
by Pamela Horner
she might have killed several thou­
sands. The accuracy we have 
achieved gave us the advance 
warning that was instrumental in 
saving all those lives.”
The earth resources satellite 
program is one of the most impor­
tant of these programs. Through 
these satellites scientists have 
discovered new geological fea­
tures. and new mineral and ore 
deposits. They have spotted 
sources, often undetected, of wa­
ter and air pollution. “What we 
learn from this program will help 
us to increase our food resources 
by using more intelligently the re­
sources we now have, and aid us 
in the harvesting and settling of 
the ocean that is being pressed on 
us because of dwindling land.” 
Satellite oceanography is one new 
science that is rapidly opening up 
as a result.
President Eisenhower’s open- 
skies policy is now possible be­
cause of the reconnaissance sat­
ellite program: “The Americans 
watch the Russians, the Russians 
watch the Americans, and both 
watch Red China. ”
"It is the communications sat­
ellite program that will allow all 
men to pair off and talk to each 
other simultaneously all over the 
world.” Early Bird, one of the 
first, could handle 240 telephone 
circuits. Now we have satellites 
that can carry 1.200. Soon, we 
will have ones that take 6.000. 
Eventually, not only will be able 
to talk, but we will also be able to 
see one another, not matter where 
we are. People won't have to 
leave home to work. "It will mean 
the end of commuting and the traf­
fic problem. It will mean the end 
of the cities, becuase their pri­
mary purpose was to bring people 
together for business. This need 
will no longer exist. And think of 
the impact educationally. We will 
be able to bring television, and 
therefore school, to all those peo­
ple living in isolated areas. The 
people who need the service most 
will receive the greatest benefit. 
The only way to solve this prob­
lem of isolation is through space 
technology: nothing else is as re­
motely cheap."
Mr. Clark goes on: "All of these 
programs have had a tremendous 
influence on society. Their influ­
ence can be correlated to the im­
pact of the railroad and the tele­
graph on America. Without them, 
the United States couldn't have 
become as it is, and with them it 
was impossible for it not to have 
developed into what it became. 
These programs and the advances 
they will bring will help to create 
a world community.”
The main controversy over the 
space program centers around the 
manned space flights. “In several 
years this controversy will seem 
inconceivable.” We need men in 
space to service the satellites, be­
cause complexity will not be pos­
sible until we can service them. 
We must abandon our present phil­
osophy; we must develop re-us- 
able space vehicles. "As it is now. 
it is comparable to the Queen Eli­
zabeth crossing the Atlantic with 
three passengers and then being 
sunk. Operating a car for one day 
yields enough energy require­
ments to go tmthe moon for a bas­
ic cost of $10. There is obviously 
room for improvement.” The an­
swer lies with nuclear rockets, 
which have been built and oper­
ated. These rockets have a much 
higher working efficiency, and 
when we harness this power, it 
will open up a system that will 
make it possible to build bases in 
space, such as space factories and 
hospitals that can benefit from the 
faccum and the weightlessness.
As for the moon, “it is the key 
to the solar system.” If the cost 
to leave the earth is equivalent to 
$10. the cost from the moon is 
25c.
“But a discussion of cost is 
avoiding the real issue. It is not a 
money problem, it is a political 
problem—a problem of vested in­
terest and stupidity. Space ex­
ploration has given us the new 
frontier that we though we had 
lost forever when the world was 
essentially discovered and settled. 
The crossing of space will take us 
out and away from the tribal con­
flicts. it will free us from the 
cycle of war and peace. The chal­
lenge is a stupendous one. and if 
we don't accet it and if we fail to 
go on to the unconquered heights, 
humanity will begin its slow des­
cent back to the primeval shore 
where it began.”
Mr. Clark is working on a TV 
special that will be ready some­
time in the spring.

Preventing Assaults to Women 
To Be Discussed by Storaska
who assault others and how and 
why of these actions, the type of 
environmental situations which 
are generally contributed to the 
assault interaction and most im­
portantly the types of behavior 
from people which usually elicits 
the most detrimental and or most 
beneficial behavior from the as­
saulter.
Mr. Storaska's program is not 
meant as a type of shock treat­
ment but rather an effort to create 
an awareness on the part of the 
student body concerning the prob­
lem of assault. This lecture should 
prove to be quite informative and 
of practical value.
Fredrick Storaska will be the 
guest lecturer on Tuesday. Nov. 
18. His topic of discussion will be 
“The Prevention of Assaults on 
Women.” This program will be 
sponsored by Associated Women 
Students.
Mr. Storaska became interested 
in this problem while he was an 
undergraduate student at North 
Carolina State University, major­
ing in psychology. Since then he 
has been conducting research on 
assaults on women and presenting 
lectures at universities through­
out the country.
In this lecture here at Carne­
gie, Mr. Storaska will endeavor to 
give people an understanding of 
the assault interaction. He will 
delve into such aspects of this 
problem as the types of people

Venture: Purify water 
with the fiber that mademen whistle.
Nylon. Reverse osmosis.
A fiber that started making girls' legs more beauti­
ful some 30 years ago.
And a process that's been around a lot longer.
But when Du Pont scientists and engineers look 
at them in a new way, they combine into an idea that 
can change the world.
Reverse osmosis is a purification process that 
requires no phase change. It's potentially the cheap­
est way to desalinate water.
Du Pont’s innovation? Hollow, semipermeable ny­
lon fibers much finer than human hair. Symmetrical, 
with an outer diameter of .002 inch and a wall thick­
ness of .0005 inch, with an accuracy of manufacture maintained at close to 100%. Twenty-five to 30 million 
of them encased in a precisely engineered unit 14 
inches in diameter by 7 feet long.
The result: a semipermeable surface area of about 
85,000 square feet—the size of a 2-acre lot—and up 
to 10,000 gallons of desalted water per day.
So far "Permasep”® permeators have been used 
experimentally to purify brackish and polluted water, 
and in various industrial separations. But the po­
tential to desalt seawater, too, is there.
So Du Pont scientists and engineers are even now 
working toward improved fibers, units and plant 
designs that should make it possible to get fresh 
water from salt at a price that any town or nation 
can afford.
Innovation—applying the known to discover the 
unknown, inventing new materials and putting them 
to work, using research and engineering to create 
the ideas and products of the future—this is the 
venture Du Pont people are now engaged in.

CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL 
WARFARE
Kept quiet for many years, but 
increasingly in the news today, is 
a topic called CBW — chemi­
cal biological warfare. A very 
small part of Army operations 
from World War I until the 1950’s 
it grew in the 60’s into a $350 
million plus per year industry 
utilizing at least seven bases and 
many universities for research 
and production.
The better known half of the 
topic is the chemical program. 
Unfortunately the agent for its 
publicity is a long list of inci­
dents which raise doubts about the 
safety of current testing and stock­
piling methods and to the regard of 
the Army for the people involv­
ed, both in America and Abroad.
The agents mainly at issue in 
these incidents were nerve gas­
es. The Army currently uses two 
such gases, GB and VX, both 
odorless and both fatal in doses as 
samll as 1/50 of a drop.
The Pentagon was forced to 
admit to stockpiling the gases on 
Okinawa when one bomb there 
sprung a leak. Despite hastily 
donning gas masks, 24 soldiers 
had to be hospitalized. A year be­
fore, 100 Okinawan children, swim-

UNITED FUND COMMITTEE
ming near the US base, were hos­
pitalized with a mysterious disease, 
never diagnosed. Gas is widely 
suspected.
Near Denver, the Rocky Moun­
tain Arsenal has been producing 
GB and VX since the early 50’s 
and dumping the wastes into re- 
serviors. Many farmers eventually 
discovered their farms ruined by 
irrigation with contaiminated 
water. The water supply for 15,
000 people had been endangered. 
After the damage had been done, 
late in the 50’s, it was revealed 
that the Army was aware of the 
danger in 1954. In addition, large 
numbers of wildlife were destroy­
ed by the poisoned waters.
Some time ago 6400 sheep 
mysteriously died in Utah. The 
Army denied responsibility for 
months, even after gas had been 
pinpointed as the cause. Finally 
it admitted that in a test at the 
Drugway Proving Grounds, an 
airplane sprying nerve gas flew 
too high. Only the winds prevent­
ed a catastrophe. As it was, 6400 
sheep died 30 miles away.
The final act (as of now) in this 
comic opera was played out this 
summer. A congressman from 
New York, Richard McCarthy, 
discovered that the Army planned 
to ship 27,000 tons of unwanted 
but still lethal mustard gas, 
GB, nerve gas, and tear gas by 
rail from Denver to New Jersey, 
where it was to be loaded on 
obsolete, rusting ships and sunk 
in the Atlantic Ocean.
The Army’s safety record is 
already questionable, particular­
ly when one considers a report 
of the Transportation Safety 
Board that train derailments have 
increased 100 per cent in the past 
decade, and that there are now 
over 5,000 each year. The Army 
stated that population centers 
would be avoided where pos­
sible — but the proposed route 
went through Indianapolis, Day­
ton, Philadelphia and Elixabeth, 
New Jersey.

Assuming there were no acci­
dents enroute, the possibility 
is strong that contamination of the 
ocean would result.
This summer fish and bathers 
in the Baltic Sea near Denmark 
were sickened when German mus­
tard gas, sunk after World War I, 
escaped from its corroded contain­
ers fifty years later. The danger 
is real.
So the Army, under pressure, 
agreed to chemically neutralize 
the gas in Denver. However, it 
is reported (to my knowledge is 
has not been confirmed) that the 
Army was already shipping the 
gas when congressman McCarthy 
blew the whistle, and that 
rusty old ship is anchored off 
Sandy Hook, New Jersey, several 
miles from New York City, half 
laden with GB bombs.
Chemical agents are in use by 
the Army today. For years US 
policy was governed by a 1943 
statement by President Roosevelt 
that the US would never be the 
first to use chemical or biologi­
cal wapons. This position was 
never canonized though. The cur­
rent policy, adopted in 1956,
revealed to Congress in 1958, 
and stated in Army manuals on 
CBW, is that on Presidential or­
der the US could strike first with 
CB weapons in conventional sit­
uations.
Today in Vietnam chemical de­
foliants and herbicides are used 
regularly as part of the policy of 
depriving the Viet Cong of food 
and cover. The results of this 
were reported in a 1967 Japanese 
study: 3.8 million arable acess 
destroyed, 1,000 peasants and 13,
000 livestock killed.
“Non lethal” gas is used at the 
discretion of local commanders 
for rooting people from bunk­
ers, tunnels, and caves and gener­
ally destroying their will to re­
sist. But in high concentrations, 
such as are likely in bunkers or 
caves, this “tear gas” kills. Such 
is often the case, as in the clear­
ing of the hamlet of Vinh Quaing 
in 1963. The gas used there kil­
led 35 people and severely pois­
oned 25 more (28 children and 26 
women were among the 60.)
All gas is banned by the 1925 
Geneva Convention. This is re­
cognized as International Law,
although the US never signed it. 
The Defense Department main­
tains that the Convention does 
not apply to our Vietnam gases. 
But doubt exists in other cir­
cles. A private study, curcula- 
ted by the State Department in
1967, states that there is no such 
legal distinction between gases.
A final note on the story of 
“non lethal” gases. Tear gas used 
last year on protesters in Berk- 
ely, California, and recently at 
Fort Dix, New Jersey, was not the 
older, commonly used CN var­
iety, but CS (super), an improved, 
more toxic form of the gas. Stu­
dies show that CS can cause severe 
scarring of the cornea, and 
can be very sickening and even 
fatal to the young and the old and 
to those suffering from respira­
tory illness.
Next week I will report on Bio­
logical Warfare, little known but 
with a greater potential for destruc­
tion than all the nuclear stock­
piles on the Earth, and on some 
views of CBW in general.

Honoraries Discuss Co-op
by Jenifer Digby
Phi Tau Gamma and Delta Skull 
met together for the second time 
on Tuesday evening, Nov. 4. Dean 
Swank was also present at the 
meeting to discuss with a revital­
ized membership possible pro­
jects for its undertaking. Several 
ideas were raised. First on the 
agenda was the suggestion that the 
two groups might work to organ­
ize a campus co-op drug store, fill­
ing the gap that Woodlawn Phar­
macy left upon its departure from 
its Forbes-Woodlawn location. 
The group invited Swank to dis­
cuss this project, and others which 
he thought might be worth their 
undertaking.
Dean Swank began by giving us 
some of the history of the two or­
ganizations—Delta Skull and Phi 
Tau Gamma. Traditionally on 
campus the two honoraries func­
tioned as organizational leaders 
for Homecoming and Spring Car­
nival. More recently, both groups 
have attempted to function as tu­
toring agencies. However, the tu­
toring was too difficult to attempt 
and was found to be a dead end, 
since few students ever respond­
ed to the offering of help from the 
honoraries. Now both groups are 
looking for a more vital and ap­
proachable function.
Swank agreed that a drug store 
selling non-prescription items,
CURTAIN
rafer pi
cosmetics, shaving supplies and 
other sundries might be a valuable 
contribution to the campus, but he 
questioned the ability for such a 
store to secure enough of a mark­
et on campus to make possible its 
survival. Where would the co-op 
be situated? Who would run it? 
Whose funds would subsidize its 
creation? What items should be 
stocked? A committee was set up 
to examine these and other ques­
tions pertaining tmthe store, and 
their proposals will be submitted 
to the membership at its next 
meeting. If it does seem to be an 
approachable idea, the next step 
will be for the committee to sub­
mit a proposal to the administra­
tion, and await its response.
Another project for considera­
tion was student hospital runs. 
Dean Swank told the group on 
Tuesday that presently campus se­
curity police make all runs to 
Shadyside Hospital for students 
who become sick on campus. Most 
of the calls come in between the 
hours of 4 p.m. and 2 a.m. These 
are also crucial hours for campus 
security, when it is vital that a 
maximum of security protection 
be available to the campus. If stu­
dents were to take over the buld 
of routine trips to the hospital dur­
ing these hours, they would be 
freeing one or more men from the 
necessity of being absent from the 
campus area. Security has be­
come a vital campus concern in 
recent months as incidents in­
volving robbery and assault occur 
more and more frequently in the 
general Oakland area. Phi Tau 
Gamma and Delta Skull, if suc­
cessful in the project, could thus 
make a very valuable contribution 
to the campus community and its 
safety.
A committee for hospital runs 
drew up its proposal at a meeting 
the following Thursday night. The 
proposal outlined the project’s 
purpose and organization, and was 
submitted to Dean Swank as rep­
resentative of the administration, 
on Friday morning. Swank. Strath- 
meyer, Thomas and Kibbee re­
viewed the proposal and relayed 
their approval for the project the 
following Tuesday, Nov. 11. It re­
mains only for the two organiza­
tions to work out the final details 
before setting their plan in mo­
tion.
In researching the project, Tony 
Wright, president of Delta Skull, 
talked with a Red Cross represen­
tative. The Red Cross, he found, 
is willing to offer a course in First 
Aid to the campus community if 
response shows it would be worth­
while.
The course would be free, ex­
cept for the possible minimal cost 
of a manual, and would involve 
some 12 hours of the student’s 
time. A minimum of 15 people 
must sign up for the course in or­
der to have it offered here. It 
will be open to the campus com­
munity. Anyone interested should 
contact Tony Wright through Cam­
pus Mail, c/o The Tartan. In or­
der to begin the takeover of hos­
pital runs, the course should be 
offered immediately, so please re­
ply at once.

Tartans Go For 4th Straight Victory 
W&J Here In Season Finale Tomorrow
The Tartans will complete the final step of their magical mystery tour tomorrow at the 
same place that it started, Tech fielda The game is against Washington and qefferson and game 
time is 1:30 pama
The C-MU football team 
first four gamesa Three of the 
Struggling with a small squad, 
juries, the Tartans dropped all 
four of these games. Even the 
most loyal Tech found it hard to 
be optimistic about the second 
half of the season.
Then, starting with our own 
Homecoming,,the magical part of 
the tour began. The Tartans scor­
ed 118 points in the next three 
matches while yielding a total of 
just 25 points to their three op­
ponents. These three victories set 
the stage for this week’s home 
game against W&J.
Terry Bell continues to be the 
big gun in the C-MU offensive at­
tack. He has run for 587 yards 
on 114 carries and has caught 24 
passes for 206 yards. Terry leads 
the team in scoring with 66 points. 
Halfback Tom Lombardo has pick­
ed up 374 yards on 94 carries. 
Most of this yardage has come in 
the last three games as Tom has 
completely recovered from a leg 
injury and the entire team has 
come to life.
Quarterback Rich Squires, the 
third sophomore in the Tartan 
backfield, has been able to oper­
ate more effectively in the past 
three games with the advent of 
the running game. Since the de­
fenders were made aware of the 
running abilities of Bell and Lom­
bardo, Squires has had more time 
to pass and the statistics bear this 
out. Rich has completed 100 of his 
219 passes for 1,459 yards and 16 
touchdowns. Six of these scoring 
tosses have been pulled in by 
freshman Charlie Price who is the 
top C-MU receiver with 30 recep­
tions.

caught eight passes for 188 yards 
this year.
Tomorrow’s opponents, W&J, 
sport a 1-6 record. However, their 
quarterback Don Kasperick, who 
has a fine arm, has a top notch re­
ceiver in sophomore Bob McLuck- 
ey. McLuckey ranks among the 
top 15 receivers in the nation’s 
small colleges.
The only victory for the Presi­
dents this season was a 27-21 
win over Western Reserve. The 
C-MU-W&J rivalry began in 1906 
with Teach winning 17, losing 20 
and five deadlocks. Last year, the 
Tartans closed out their season 
with a 26-0 victory at W&J.
If the Tartans can beat the Pres­
idents tomorrow, it will be the 
first time in ten years that a Tar­
tan football squad has won four 
consecutive games. So come see 
history in the making yourself. 
Take a walk to the football field. 
Remember, 1:30 p.m.
