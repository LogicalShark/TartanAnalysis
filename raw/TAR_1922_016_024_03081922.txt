FOR EVENTS OF 
CAMPUS WEEK
Campus Week Committee 
Wants Applications For 
Concessions. Unique Design 
Prepared For Tags
VARSITY MEN TO WEAR
DISTINCTIVE CAP
COMMITTEE CHANGED
Campus Week is slowly but very 
suredy approaching. Since the com- 
/ mittee plans to make this week the 
biggest week in the history o£ Car­
negie Tech’s Campus Week, it is 
up to every student and alumnus to 
get in action.
All those who wish concessions 
for this week, the last week in May. 
are urged to send in their applica­
tions as early as possible. This will 
give the committee a chance to de­
cide what concessions will be the 
most advisable. Competition is the 
life of business, so get busy at once. 
It wouldn’t seem right to have a 
Campus Week without peanuts and 
red pop.
Those who intend to do any sell­
ing at the Mardi Gras shouild also 
,get in touch with the committee as 
soon as possible. The committee 
will also operate concessions, paying 
a percentage to those operating. For 
the present, all communications will 
be received by P. J. Unzicker, chair­
man, Campus Week Committee, care 
Post Office.
Don't forget that the committee 
wants every man, woman and child 
at Carnegie Tech to be thinking 
about new stunts for the events and, 
shows. Send in any new ideas thi 
occur to you. Don’t get the impres­
sion that Campus Week is entirely 
planned out months ahead. /The 
committee wants as many new/stunts 
as possible, for the enjoyment and 
interest in any affair depends on , the 
originality and novelty of its make­
up. Start thinking now!
It might be well to give up one 
movie night a week, and save your 
money for this series of events. The 
Campus Week tags wild1 be of a .very 
unique design.
There have been two changes in 
the general committee. V. H. Strom- 
quist will be chairman of the Pub­
licity Committee, while Dan Cassidy 
will be chairman of Campus Week 
Parade Committee.
The "C” Club held a meeting on 
March 2, at which several important 
matters were taken care of. A 
Varsity hat was selected .•which will 
be worn by the members of the club. 
This is a neat appearing hat of pearl- 
gray with a one quarter inch black 
band and a small plaid C on the 
front.
The Varsity dance will be conduct­
ed in the Union on March 24 with 
Maggio’s Orchestra to furnish the 
music. The letter men have ailso ten­
dered their services for policing and 
ushering on the campus during 
'Campus Week.
Mr. Neville, Sch. 9211, requests that 
each member notify him of the size 
of hat needed so that the new head­
dress may make its appearance on 
the campus very shortly.
Commencement exercises are 
scheduled to take place the 16th of 
June at Carnegie Music Hall 
No definite plans have as yet been 
formulated but it is hoped to make 
the occasion one to be remembered 
by everybody. ¦
Several good speakers are being 
considered but at this writing no 
particular person has been decided 
on.
The Baccalaureate address will be 
given on the 11th of June.
Seven Senior Architects 
In Paris Prize Contest
Winner is Given Scholarship 
in the Ecole des 
Beaux Arts
On Saturday morning, February 25, 
at 9 a. m., seven Seniors of the Ar­
chitectural Department, College of 
Fine Arts, started on an Esquisse or 
rendered sketch for the first prelim­
inary of the Paris Prize Competition. 
At 9 p. m. of the same day Messrs. 
Pauly, Olsen, Sorber, Rank, Chester- 
taan, Hunt, Pellegrinni and Burke 
submitted their solution of “a Pri­
vate Library,’’ which was the subject 
of the competition. Messrs. L. Lasli- 
mit and P. Simpson were exempt 
from the first preliminary, being 
among the best fifteen picked by the 
Committee on Paris Prize for ranking 
high in Beaux Art work. It was in­
deed an honor bestowed upon Car­
negie Tech to have two men exempt 
for their good work.
The national competitions for tlffe 
Paris Prize'are organized for the pur­
pose of choosing a scholar to pursue 
his studies in the first class of the 
Ecole des Beaux Arts of Paris. These 
competitions must be held according 
to the regulations adopted by the 
French Ministry of Public Instruction 
and Fine Arts.
The Paris Prize iScholar receives 
§1,200 a year for a period of two and a 
half years, dating from his arrival in 
Europe, which is to be as soon after

Grove City, Geneva, West­

Are Contestants. Second 
Series a Week Later
TEAMS ARE PICKED
STUDENTS URGED TO HEAR 
/ DR. EDWIN J. VAN ETTEN
AT CHAPEL MON. MARCH\
Dr. Edwin J. Van Etten gave the 
first of the chapel services during 
Lent last Monday. Dr. Van Etten will 
speak again at the second of the serv­
ices arranged by the Y. M. C. A. and 
Y. W. C. A. The chapel hour is 12:50 
on Mondays and every Carnegie stu­
dent should try his best to come out. 
A very good group of speakers has 
been procured for the remainder of 
the chapel services during Lent.
It. is the purpose of those who have 
the campus chapel services at heart 
to make the four scheduled before 
Easter especially valuable and im­
pressive. Coming as they do, in the 
period of Lent, when thinking people 
of all denominations are more seri­
ously regarding things spiritual than 
at any other time of the year, they 
should arouse greater interest and be 
more largely attended than any of 
the foregoing.
The speakers have been carefully 
chosen and the messages which they 
will bring should be decidedly worth 
while.
It has been decided that no chapel 
services are to be held after Easter 
for the remainder of the school year, 
so that these last four Lenten serv­
ices afford a fine opportunity to add 
a fitting close - to the good work 
which has been begun this year and 
to furnish impetus to the movement 
for . next year and the years to come.
Give the chapel services your vote 
of confidence by attending the four 
remaining. It will be a distinct serv­
ice which you render to your school, 
to your associates and to yourself, 
for which you are sure to be amply 
repaid.
This Friday evening at the Carne­
gie Lecture Hall the first of a series 
of intercollegiate debates will be held. 
Starting on the first leg of the Pen­
tangular involving Grove City Col­
lege, Geneva, Westminster, Theil and 
Carnegie Tech this institution will 
send its affirmative team against the1 
negative debaters of Westminster. 
On the same evening our negative 
trio will journey to Greenville and 
engage in a debate with Theil Col­
lege. The second series will be held 
a week later with Grove City in 
Pittsburgh and Carnegie at Geneva.
The question for discussion is Re­
solved: That Congress should enact 
legislation which will give the Rail­
road Labor Board full power to en­
force its decisions (Constitutionality 
conceded.) "This is a topic of 
timely interest in view of the fact 
that the Board at the present time 
is under fire not only from the op­
erators' of the roads but also from 
the employees. In fact conditions 
are such that neither side may be 
said to hold ah advantage over the 
other as regards the question.
Coa'ch Peterson has spared no ef­
forts in the drilling of the men for 
the contests and with the wide ex­
perience he has had in debate Car- 
>negie can be assured of representa­
tive teams well coached. The per­
sonnel1 of the affirmative team has 
not' yet been definitely decided upon 
as there are. four men working on 
that side of the question: Messrs.
H. K. Burr, H. Schoerke, J. Silver­
man and J. Kenriy. The negative 
team has been definitely picked and 
Friday will witness the departure of 
Messrs A. Iffland, K. J. Lawrence 
and L. J. Whitehead for Theil.
A large number of Westminster 
alumni residing in Pittsburgh have 
signified their intention of being 
present for the contest in support 
of the visiting team and it is urged 
that as many students and ajumni 
as possible of this institution attend 
the debate. Admission to students is 
free on presentation of their registra­
tion cards, and special! arrangements 
are being made for High School atu-

C. H. SORBER WINS ARCH. 
PRIZE OF FIFTY DOLLARS
Charles H. Sorber of Jeannette, 
Pa., a Senior in architecture at the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
won the Pupln prize of the Beaux Arts 
Institute of Design for this year, ac­
cording to word just received by 
Prof. Harry Sternfeld of the Col­
lege of Fine Arts. This is consider­
ed by Professor Sternfeld a mark 
of distinction for Tech because of 
the numbers competing and the re­
quirements for this prize.'
The Pupin prize is an annual 
award of fifty dollars donated by 
Prof. M. I. Pupin of Columbia Uni­
versity, for the best student render­
ing of a problem in the ornamental 
treatment of a scientific appliance, 
This year’s problem was to design 
a central lighting fixture to hang 
directly above the dancing floor in 
the supper room of a hotel, making 
it the principal motive of the deco­
rative scheme and the chief source 
of light.
Sorber's design, according to Pro­
fessor Sternfeld, called for the use 
of metal and glass and was note­
worthy for beauty of conception com­
bined with practicability.
CARNEGIE MUSICIANS-

CLUBS CLOSE SEASON 
WITH HOME CONCERT
Signor Scalzo, Director of 
Mandolin Clüb Will 
Render. Solo
On the evening of Friday, March 
17, the Carnegie Musical Clubs will 
give their annual Home Concert in 
the Carnegie Music Hall. This con­
cert marks the close of the most suc­
cessful season the clubs have yet ex­
perienced. Whenever the clubs ap­
peared their work was highly com­
mended. In Erie the ¡Colgate and Al­
legheny Musical Clubs precoded 
them and public sentiment gave the 
laurels to the Carnegie organization. 
The work of the Glee Club is ovon 
more commendable considering the 
fact that the director of this organi­
zation is a student In the Music De­
partment, namely, A.'.H. Johnson.
The Mundolin Club this year is bet­
ter than ever and the additions of 
the cello and horn sections have 
been materially felt. This organiza­
tion has performed very well under 
the student directorship of S. E. ICo- 
vaclc, Jr. Signor Gregorio Scalzo, the 
director, will bo present at the con­
cert and not only dirbct the club, but 
favor with a solo which should bo a 
rare treat for all tho.so present.
Other soloists of the ovonlng will 
bo .Stewart Blackmore, the collist 
from the Mandolin Club, and R. It. 
Sawhill and L. R. Turcotte, who will 
favor with vocal solos. The Toch 
Novelty Orchestra will prosent a new 
repertoire of popular songs and will 
be assisted by Web Cunningham.
The Homo Concert Ball following 
the concert will begin at 10 o’clock 
and will last until two. It will bo hold 
In the Schonloy Ballroom, a conveni­
ent distance from the Music Hall,
Tickets for the concert will bo on 
sale and can be had from any mom- 
her of the Musical Clubs. The danco 
following the concert will bo formal 
and Is the only formal on the campus 
that every Carnegie student Is ollg- 
iblo for.
ARCHITECTS FAIL TO
FOOL THE JURY
At the last Judgment at Beaux 
Arts, New York, Mr. George Pauly 
received a second medal on a de­
sign for “A Bachelor’s Residence in 
a City.’’ There were four stings 
one H. C.” and the remainder men­
tions.
On Friday, March 3, the Juniors 
of the department took an Esquisse 
for “A Jewelry Shop,” and the Soph­
omores took an Esquisse for “A Pa-
I vilion on a Bridge."
Through co-operation with the 
Westinghouse Radio Department Car­
negie musicians are becoming well 
known in radio circles. They have 
several times furnished partial or 
entire programs, the Stringers be­
ing foremost in this activity.
The Westinghouse concerts are 
broadcast and are heard by all the 
better equipped amateurs within a 
range of several hundred miles. 
They are becoming very popular, and 
several thousand people hear them 
every night.
The concert on February 11 was 
given by the Glee Club, which owing 
to its many engagements, has been 
unable to give any more. It Is also 
to be regretted that the band has 
not been heard via wireless duo to 
the inability of the Westinghouse 
station to accommodate so largo a 
body.
The Stringers, however, have 
played on three occasions. In the 
(beginning of December and again 
during January they furnished the 
entire program. On February 23 
four numbers of the program were 
rendered so well by the Stringers 
that a request from a fictitious 
King of the Zuilu Isles for an encore 
was received. The Stringers take 
great interest in this work and ex­
pect to give several more concerts in 
the near future.
MOVIES AND MUSIC
AT INDUSTRIES ASSEMBLY
The first Industries Assembly of 
the second semester was hold Wed­
nesday, March 1, at 12:20, The es­
pecial attraction of the assembly was 
a very interesting and Instructive 
three-reel moving picture, demon­
strating the production of machine 
parts In the National Acme Machine 
Company plant at Cleveland, Ohio.
The Plebe Orchestra, consisting of 
saxaphone, violin, piano and drums, 
furnished excellent music for the oc­
casion. This orchestra, though organ­
ized only a short time ago, has 
proved its merits and is a great 
help In attracting Industries men to 
assembly.
President Godden read the resolu­
tion drawn up by the Plebe cflass of 
Industries pledging its members 
against cribbing in exams, and high­
ly commended the class for its ac­
tion on this matter. He also read 
a letter of congratulation to the 
Plebe class from Alpha Tau fratern­
ity. This society greatly encourages 
the Freshman class to continue their 
efforts to eliminate cribbing.

During tho coming Easter vacation 
the Gniphlca Socloty of tho Depart­
ment cf Printing will take ono of 
tho longest and most extensive In­
spection trips ,ovor taken In the his­
tory of the club. About twenty-live 
members of tho club are ollglblo to 
go on tho journey which will start 
on Tuesday, April <1.
From Pittsburgh tho members will 
go to Springfield’, Mass., whoro they 
have been Invited by tho Strathmore 
Paper Company to visit their pulp 
and paper mills situated in the Berk­
shire hills. From there the trip will 
be extended to New • York City 
where several days will be spent In 
inspecting jprinting plants and other 
Industrial concerns related to the 
printing industry.
Philadelphia will be the next place 
of inspection. Here the club will 
vlsjt one of the largest printing 
plants in the country, that of tlio 
Curtis Publishing Company. Several 
other large printing plants in this 
city will also be visited.
The last city scheduled on the 
trip Is Washington, D. C., where the 
Government Printing Office will be 
Inspected,
That the Graphica Club is able to 
go on such a thorough and extended 
trip as this is due only to the stren­
uous effort and hard labor of its 
members during the recent Christmas 
card campaign. The profits from 
this campaign were nearly enough 
to pay all expenses of those partici­
pating in the trip.
MARCH 31 DATE FOR THREE- 
SCHOOL JUNIOR BANQUET. 
PLAN UNDECIDED AS YET
The Three-School Junior Banquet 
will be hold on the 31st of March. vJust 
where it will take place has not yet 
been decided but the committee has 
been considering The Pines, which is 
located in the outskirts of Pittsburgh 
and is an ideal place for a banquet. 
The Banquet Committee, which is 
composed of men from Science, De­
sign and Industries, is working hard 
to arrange a banquet and program 
which will surpass any yet held by a 
Junior Class of Carnegie Tech. The

PHYSICISTS GO ON 
INSPECTION TRIPS
Physics Colloquium Meetings 
Suspended While Methods 
Are Studied Directly
The meetings of the Physics Collo- 
quini were suspended during Inspec­
tion Week to give the physicists an 
opportunity to study at first hand 
methods of particular interest to 
them. They Yisited the Macbeth 
Evans Glass Company, the Research 
Division of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, the U. S- Bureau of 
Mines, tho Stupakoff Laboratories, 
tho Radium Chemical Company and 
tlio Wostlnghouso Electric Company. 
Representatives of these institutions 
gave liberally of their time and ef­
fort In explaining tho various pro­
cesses. It la evident that tho Car­
negie Institute 1s fortunatoly situated 
for tho training of physicists when 
ono considers tho large amount and 
variety of development work going 
on In the Pittsburgh district.
On Thursday afternoon, February
16, Mr. E. M. Pugh described some 
of Bridgman’s work on high pres­
sures in which Bridgman made use 
of his experience gained in work at 
onormoiiHly high pressures to malco a 
gun In a single plooo, tho resistance 
of tho material to oxplosion pres­
sures being raised by subjoetlng the 
barrel of tho gun to prolonged and 
very great hydrostatic pressures. Mr. 
Pugh doscrlbed In dotall tho kind of 
packing which makes such a procoss 
possible. Tho same afternoon Mr. E. 
R. Owon doscrlbed a now tone gener­
ator Invented by C. W. Hewlett or 
the University of Iowa. It Is claim* 
od that this gonerator gives a puro 
tone of constant and measureablo 
pitch and Intensity over a wldo range. 
Tests have shown very good results 
when the Instrument In used as a tel­
ephone transmitter or receiver.
On Thursday, February 23, Mr. B, 
W. Armspach of the Bureau of Mines, 
gave an account of bln work on tem­
perature. humidity and air motion 
effects In ventilation. Ho showed a 
new Instrument, the Kata thermom­
eter, which Is very useful In deter­
mining tho conditions of factories, 
etc., as related to human comfort. 
This Instrument Is remarkably sen­
sitive. Mr. Armspaoh's paper gave tho 
physicists a good Idea of tho valu­
able work that Is being done by tho 
Amorlcnn Society of Heating and 
Ventilating Engineers In this vicin­
ity. The same aftornoon Mr. W. H.

CARNEGIE ENDS 
SEASON WITH 
TWO VICTORIES
The Defeat of Bethany and

Gym Brings Season to 
Close. Moran Plays Well
TEN WINS FOR YEAR
A whirlwind finish by Carnegie 
Tech's five ¦ enabled them to defeat 
the West ‘ Virginia Wesleyan floor- 
men by tho close score of 31-30 last 
Thursday night in the Tech gym and 
on Saturday night Carnegie ended 
the season by defeating Bethany 35- 
25.
In the Wesleyan game the West 
Virginians got the jump on Tech at 
the start of the game and scored 8 
points before Dosey registered the 
first for Tech. The visitors in this 
half outplayed Tech in every depart­
ment of the game and the half ended 
with the score 20*10 In favor of Wes­
leyan.
Anderson' replaced Nelson at for­
ward at the beginning of the second 
half and Moran was shifted to the 
center position. Wosleyan succeeded 
In maintaining Its lead up until the 
last few minuses of the game when 
with the score standing 30-2ti Moran 
and Anderson each caged a 'k’.skot. 
which, with Dosoyts free throw, won 
the game for Tech by a ono-point 
margin. Anderson scored tho win­
ning shot a few seconds before the 
game ended on a difficult shot just 
as Referee Baird slipped and fell, 
wrenching his lcnoo. This accident 
confused tho Wosleyan players, but 
tho ball was still In play Inasmuch as 
tho whistle had not boon blown.

cellent game for Woaloya.u, tlio for­

OUR DUAL GOVERNMENT
The Board of Student Activities and the Student Council, at 
present, are the two organizations having jurisdiction over the non- 
athletic activities in all the Colleges oil the Institute. The Student 
Council has the power “to act on and decide all questions pertaining 
to the four schools as a unit.” “The control and supervision of all 
recognized non-athletic student -activities” is the purpose of the Stu­
dent Activities Board. The constitution of these two bodies conflict. 
Their work conflicts and is a duplication.
Student government is about 50 years old and it, is a subject 
which has been left entirely to the student to solve. Their progress 
bjis been slow, because of the lack of continuity in policy and the 
< ini:: available to students for such work. It was not until last year 
that a concerted effort, on the part of the colleges in the Cast, was 
made to study the problems of student government. Just about that 
time some few, realized that something was wrong with our dual gov­
ernment.
It is only by common (issent,, at present, that anyone knows in 
which of our two governing bodies the final authority is vested. If 
the Board of Student Activities questioned the right of the Student 
Council, to,interfere in any of the activities, who would decide the 
question? By their constitution both of them have the right. Ono 
centralized authority is needed. Either the Student Activities Board 
or the Student Council should be voted out of existence or both and 
a new centralized body: organized which shall have absolute power 
and authority over all activities, athletic and non-athletic.
A combined committee from the Student Activities Board and 
the Student Council are at work on this new government We roa,- 
lizo that many difficult problems have been encountered, and that 
it takes time and thought to work out such a form of government 
and make it applicable to Carnegie Tech, but the tendency of stu­
dent committees is to drag along. This in a measure is due to the 
time a student may take from his studies. However, the Tartan sees 
lugger and better activities under the now form of government and 
for this reason, wo would lilto to sec the now form ol! government 
ready, for installation next year.

COMMENTS
EDUCATION BY THE HOUR‘AN IDEAL HUSBAND” GIVEN
BY DRAMA DEPARTMENT
"The student, like the wage-earner, 
in paid by the hour. He lias hln 
day'» work cat out for him, -and 
Yery hour he misses la chalked up 
against hln pay-rolil1. Only the time-’ 
clock in lacking for him to punch, as 
ho on ter« and leave« the hall of 
learning. But the professor 1ft both 
foreman and time-keeper; and ho 
doe» his Job -well.
"Pay day come» around only twice 
a year In the University. In Feb­
ruary and In .June the grand reckon­
ing Is made, and the student marches 
boldly1 up to neck hi» reward, if he 
ha» boon a good workman, steady at 
lie job, ho 1h paid accordingly. But 
bin Bln» of omission, too, are amply 
'opald; and usually ho ilndB that 
IiIb pay has been cut because now 
and then ho has failed to report for 
duty,
'America as a nation 1» supposed 
to bo mechanically Inclined. We 
like to dot things in job lots, per­
haps because there are Äi many of 
V2 and so many things to do. We 
try to mako our products all meas­
ure up to a uniform standard. The 
college student I2 a product as 
well a»' a workman. The 
college is the factory, and when it 
haB llnlBhed with a man it puts him 
on the market, with a label attached 
'bearing a couple of letters to indi­
cate what -particular variety of pro­
duct ho is.
“If an education of a specified 
number of hours spent in the class 
room, with notebook in hand and 
pencil busy, then the system in 
voguo faJlls not far short of Lbe ideal. 
The professor knows to a hair’s 
breadth whether Mrll. So-and-^So lias 
received three hour’s worth of edu­
cation In his course, and by adding 
up what Mr. So-and-So has done it is 
a problem of simple arithmetic at 
the end of your year's time to de­
termine whether he measures up to 
the standard. If lie does, he gets 
Ills degree;. if not, he departs uned­
ucated.
“If on the other hand the purpose 
of a university Is somewiiat broader 
than the purpose of a factory—If an 
education is something more than 
drinking in knowledge by the hour- 
are CAi not stressing too heavily the 
requirements, till they become the

the most cosplcuous thing in sight.
If there really is a deeper reason 
for tlio exlstonce of a university, 
why cannot the student be let in on 
the secret? Not by a high-sounding 
address at the beginning of the year,
surely, but by finding it in his daily
contact with those who dole out to 
him hi» morsefl'a of knowledge. Could 
it not bo done, ovon under our whole­

PLEBES GIVE STUNT PARTY 
TO UPPER CLASSES
With now clasHOH come now idoas 
to Margaret M'orrlflön. The latest 
has boon a stunt party for the thr 
upper clansori which tlio Froshmon 
gave In tlio Recreational Hall 
Monday, the twenty-seventh. The 
Dizzy Wight, al Intervalls, provided 
tlio moans whereby all danced In ad­
mirable and-lovely fashion.
M. M. C. C. ASSEMBLY
Last. Wednesday the Margaret 
Morrison Assembly was In tlio 
hands of the Sophomore class. The 
Mauon-Dlxon Twont>nino played sev­
eral of the late song hits.
Tlio real event, however, was a 
llttlo play, “And tlio Lamp Wont 
Out.”
At a Short business session after 
Ibis portion of the assembly, 
Martha Zimmerman was nominated 
for the office of spcretary-troasurer 
of the Margaret Morrison Guild to 
fill the office left vacant by the 
resignation of the present secretary 
treasurer.
Miss Purdy at Conference
On Monday afternoon, March 13, 
at 4:30, the Y. W. C. A. of Carnegie 
Tecli will hold a meeting in the
Recreation Hall of the Margaret
Morrison School, the purpose of the
meeting will be to present to the
association the business plans and 
program of the Central Student Con­
ference to be held at Hot Springs, 
Arkansas, immediately after the 
Easter recess.
Iiortense Purdy lias been selected, 
to ropresont Toch nt this conference. 
The Y. W. C. A. officials encourage 
every member to attend this meet­
ing in order (hat direction may be 
given to Miss Purdy in regard to 
any issues she might bo cailled to 
vote upon.
in the production of “An Ideal Hus­
band,” the Drama Department has 
added another to its long list of suc­
cesses; the play is a success in spite 
of rather obvious defects.
The basic difficulty is Oscar Wilde' 
himself. If he is regarded as a mod­
ern rcaliBt "An Ideal Husband” is a 
distinct disappointment, for the play 
is deplorably conventional and ex­
cept in the porBiflago ironically un­
original. If, however, he is regarded, 
as probably ho must be, aB one who 
uses the tricks of the drama of con­
versation, and tbe situations of melo­
drama in order to create a genre of 
his own, then “An Ideal Husband” 
makes an appeal to the lovers of nov­
elty.
The difficulty of presenting realis­
tically, therefore, a play that is per­
haps to be regarded as entirely con­
ventional, must be obvious to all. The 
use of hackneyed material such as 
blackmailing of public ofifcials, and 
the stealing of .Qetters by a seductive 
villalnes,#, must be made at once ac­
ceptable and ludicrous. A barrage of 
witticisms and' paradoxes, must be 
made not merely amusing but vital. 
To awaken sympathy and tolerance 
in an audience by means of dialogue 
that in itself conveys no warmth or 
sincerity in no easy laslc. To alter­
nate between moments of clever ver- 
'biage and moments of intense action 
requires skill. Such are the problems 
of the play.
Added to these are the natural ones 
arising from the youth and inexperi­
ence of the actors. The portrayal of 
social types, particularly British so­
cial types, that are at once so like 
and yet so nnlike American social 
types, requires no small amount of 
social experience. Inevitably the re­
sult, In this production, was a certain 
lack of poise and assurance, and an 
awkwardness of posture.
The first act, although lacking the 
eclat of a brilliant soiree, was well 
done. The picture was really very 
pleasing. Setting, lighting, costumes, 
movement harmonized well. Except at 
moments, the grouping was good.
The second act, particularly be­
cause of the setting, partly because 
of the general undramatic quality of 
the act, was dismal and tedious. It 
was relieved only by Adelaide Zelle’s 
admirable bit of characterization. The 
third act proved a most gratifying re­
lief. It was well sustained and very 
effective
Individual honors should, perhaps, 
not be awarded, as those who filled 
the leading roles acquitted them­
selves equally well. Ellen Lowe, as 
Mrs. Chevoley, should have starred, 
but she failed to antagonize her au­
dience sufficiently—a fatal defect in 
a villainess. A little morij sang froid, 
or a more insinuating manner, might 
have added mucii to the part. A more 
skiilliiij use of the eyes, hands and 
voice—which is quite pelaslng—might 
have given more depth to an other- 
Ise capable interpretation. Miss 
Lowo has range, but slio is yet unde­
veloped.
Lawrence Paquin gave a satisfying 
and human, if not an inspired charac­
terization of Cl) 11 tern. Mary Lissfelt 
and Carl Reid, both played their parts 
with understanding and spirit. Both 
got much out of tlio roles. Theodore 
Vlohman, as the Earl of Cavorsham, 
did the best ploeo of character work 
lie has dono for somo time, a much 
more convincing characterization 
than he has given to similar parts. 
Miss Harmon road her linos intelli­
gently, but without tlio lightness that 
Mabel Chiltoru suggosts.
Has Roso Hertz at last given ovi- 
denco that lie can subordinate him- 
Boll' to a part? The restraint with 
which ho acted Phipps under very 
trying circumstances is Worthy of 
praise. Considerably more work of 
the kind wi'll bo necessary, however, 
before ho lias obtained self mastery.
Evelyn Cohen made a satisfactory 
Countess. Her lisp contributed, per- ^ 
haps, to j the effectiveness of the 
drawl. Dorothy Shell, though good to 
look upon, was disappointing as Mrs. 
Marclunont. Philip Thorn and Bur­
dette Kappes deserve commendation 
for the bits they contributed. Miss 
Cohen is to be congratulated on her 
costume' creations.
“An Ideal Husband,” because of its 
very difficulties serves as an excel­
lent vehicle for theatrical training. It 
provides a rare opportunity to do .a 
society .play in the contemporary 
manner. We should be grateful to Mr. 
Wallace for choosing it, and for his 
success in producing it.
Now that Old Sol is chasing the 
snow. Which came so unexp&ctedly. 
The practice of taking a short cut. 
Behind the little Y hut. Should 
cease for the sake ot our campus. 
The chief offenders. It is rumored 
have been. The girls. And the big, 
strong, winning. Students of Art.
An appeal to the girls. Brought 
forth a pledge. Which they will 
keep if it kills them.' To keep off 
the grass on the cut. Such spirit is 
rare. But means a lot more. Than 
most p£ us can imagine. Let Arts 
do the same. And not be. .put to 
shame. BY a practice that’s inex- 
cuBable. You guilty. You know it. 
We've watched you.
For years there has /oeen a rump­
us. About our dirty campus. And 
the lack of grass: and beauty. Now 
who would set up. Such a howl I 
ask you. But the very ones who, 
Now are offending. Are you the 
type of man. Who doesn’t care, 
Or will you co-operate. To make 
the place, a little more sedate. Rally 
round and help a bit. Get up a 
little early. Its only a bit more ex­
ertion. To take the longer excur­
sion. If the girls can do it. So 
can you.
Forget Arts, school1 for a moment. 
And remember your part of Carnegie 
Tech. Observe the sign that says
PLEASE.”

will be in operation in the near fu­
ture.
From statements made by several 
members it seems as though the 
club will be able to hold their next 
meeting in the new club room at 
Henderson Hall. The room is to be 
furnished jointly by the school and 
the club. Keys are to be given only 
to these qualified to operate the set.
A smoker, for the members of the 
Club and members of the faculty, is 
under consideration. Plans are be­
ing made to secure several speakers 
for this occasion so it is urged that 
all radio men be on the lookout for 
this event.
The next meeting will be held this 
evening at which time a discussion 
of new qualifications will take place. 
The Radio Club has a great future 
since It has been recognized as a 
campus activity so all radio men 
are urged to take a hint and become 
active workers in the olub.

The Tartan is to be congratulated' 
on its good judgment in the publica­
tion of Director Bossange’s address 
to the faculty on “The Policy of Arts” 
because there has been a feeling, 
more or less prevalent, that in Arts a 
policy was untenable, even if desir­
able.
It is reassuring to find that Arts 
has, as a director, one who so thor­
oughly understands the fundamentals 
on which an Art career is built, that 
lie is able to state in concrete terms, 
what has been nebulous even to 
those who practice the Arts.
This addresB is of vital interest to 
both students and alumni of The Col­
lege of Arts. It clears up years of un­
certain and apparently aimfless study, 
spent in groping after things, that al­
ways eluded one’s grasp. It gives a so­
lution of several questions very con­
fusing and puzzling to the inquiring 
mind. It discloses the process of the 
Art impulse from its inception to its 
crystallization, when it becomes “a 
thing of beauty and a joy forever.”
It inspires confidence in the future 
of this school, which is of deep con­
cern to all who have passed within 
its portals.

PLAID ATHLETICS
Three Games Remain 
On Plebe Schedule
Yearlings Meet Turtle Creek 
High and Duquesne 
High This Week
Since the varsity has sung its 
swan song the Carnegie Tech Plebes 
stand alone in basket balll limelight, 
and it remains for them to keep the 
good name of Carnegie Tech before 
the sporting world.
Monday night Coach Robert Wad­
dell takes his fast little quintet to 
Turtle Creek to play Turtle Creek 
High School on their own floor. Tur­
tle Creek is no team to be belittled, 
for it was that that which pressed 
Braddoek High so hard for the cham­
pionship of Section 2.
Friday night they travel to Irwin, 
Pa., to meet the Norwin High five. 
Norwin has had a very successful 
season so far this year and is ranked 
among the strongest teams of Sec­
tion 5. They have only lost a few 
games and. those were to the strong 
Duquesne High by only two points, 
and to Braddoek, the champions of 
Section 2, by ten points.
A third game is pending with Con- 
nellesville. This game will be played 
as soon as a satisfactory date can 
be agreed upon.
As their schedule is rapidly draw­
ing to an end it is interesting to note 
the record of the Plaid Yearlings for 
this season. In Matter, Murray, Gil­
bert, Brooks and Koppes Coach Bob 
Waddell has developed a fast little 
team which any school would be 
proud of. This is the first year that 
Carnegie Tech has had a Freshman 
team composed only of Freshmen. 
The record of this team to date 
stands eight wins against four de­
feats. The Plebes rolled up 40G 
points while their opponents could 
garner only 325. Matter and Murray 
make two neat working forwards, 
while Brooks, guard, promises to be­
come one of Carnegie Tech’s best aill- 
around athletes. He has the makings 
in him and good coaching will bring it 
out. Gilbert is filling well the hole 
made when Oles was forced to leave 
the team. He is jumping center in a 
commendable fashion. Gilbert tried 
out for the varsity at the beginning 
of the season, but found school work 
too pressing, so waited until after 
exams, before reporting to Bob Wad­
dell. Gilbert also played Freshman 
football and intends to work hard for 
the varsity next year.

RESEARCH IN PLUMBING 
CARRIED ON UNDER MR. DIBBLE
On February 22, Mr. A. G. Han­
sen, a member of the Federal Com­
mittee on Building Codes, desig­
nated by Secretary Herbert Hoover, 
visited |the ICarn/egiie Institute of
Technology. His object was to in­
spect the researches carried on fh 
the Plumbing Department under Mr. 
Dibble in the availability, of vitrified 
alay pipe for drainage purpose in 
buildings.
îïïr. Hansen was planning to have 
a series of tests carried out at the 
Bureau of Standards, but after
scrutiny of the experimental work 
carried out in the shops of Carne­
gie Tech, hie was perfectly willing 
to accept the findings of the re­
search work here as definite.
This research has been financed 
by the Eastern Clay Products Asso­
ciation. Some sixty-four determina­
tions of the effectiveness of different 
kinds of joining materials for use 
with vitrified clay pipe have been 
made.
DOWN TOWN MAN TALKS
TO STUDENT ARCHITECTS
On Wednesday afternoon, March 
1, at 1:30 p. m., Mr. Trimbell, noted 
architect of Pittsburgh, gave a lec­
ture to the Department of Architec­
ture, on the subject, of the “Architect 
and the Owner.”
His talk wasi indeed interesting 
and; of great value to those who are 
to enter the profession. He empha­
sized the fact that the architect was 
the chief adviser of the owner and 
his position was a responsible one. 
1-Ie also mentioned that as future 
architects the men should carry out 
fully the meaning of their profession 
when they are doing their wefk.
Mr. Trimbell is a member of'.the 
American Institute of Architects, 
whose Pittsburgh Branch is doing all 
they can to bring the student of the 
profession in as close contact as 
possible with the practicing world.
CARNEGIE TECH MECHANICS
CLUB HOLDS MEETING
At a short meeting of the Carne­
gie Tech Mechanics Club, held last 
Wednesday, plans for a smoker 
were briefly discussed and dues were 
collected.
The curricula of the courses which 
members are pursuing have been ap­
proved by the American Society of 
Industrial Engineers. It is expected 
that the Carnegie Tech Mechanics 
Club’s petition for a. student chapter 
of the American Society of Industrial 
Engineers will soon be granted.
The granting of this petition will 
be another important step towards 
national recognition of Carnegie 
Tech’s ,high standing in the esteem 
of the engineering profession.
At the present time other schools 
that are. petitioning are Massachu­
setts Institute of Technology, Penn 
State and New York .University.

On The Plaid Screen
BY H. F. SIMPSON
STARTING AGAIN
Last week’s record of five wins out of six starts was good. Add to this 
the four out of five of the week before, and pufi out your chest.
The Varsity and Plebes came through with a perfect score. The girls 
played a great game against Westminster, but were defeated only after a 
liard-played game.
The Varsity with its four successive victories over West Virginia Uni­
versity, West Virginia Wesleyan, and Betliauy finished its season in a glo­
rious fashion.
All of which reminds us, the men’s teams combined have a record of 
uine straight victories.
Keep up the good work!
This is something for the spring sports to remember when they start.
Let’s “Carry on.”
“Bob” says he has just told his Freshmen team the object of the game— 
to put the ball through the loop.
Good work, "Bon"—we rather "tiiot” something was amiss during the 
recent losing spell. Reckon we'll hear of nothing but victories from now on.
TO THE EARLY BIRD ------!
As the basket ball season ends, and the baseball season is on the very 
verge of arriving, many thing of importance to the sport must be called to 
your attention, Mr. Carnegie Tech Man.
There is work to be done on the new baseball diamond. The Athletic 
Association is ready to throw its energies into this work; but help must be 
forthcoming before this work can be handled as it should. It is, as usual, up 
to the Real Tech Men to do this work.
There are many things that will hinder the progress of this work. Chief 
among these is a certain amount of apathy on the part of the student body, 
and of the managerial assistants. This can be stamped out by the proper 
show of attitude on the part of the apathetically inclined. So fellows, throw 
off this indifference, and get into the swim. Assistants for the managers 
are needed. There is a good chance for Plebes to get a good start towurds 
a manager’s letter. It is the early bird that gets the worm, so get out 
there RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING.
The above can be said for Tenuis and Track also. What holds good in 
one branch of athletics holds good in all others.
So, a call is hereby issued for assistant managers for baseball, tennis 
and track. Don’t be bashful, Fellows!
Good work, Wesleyan—we’re glad we won, but it must be admitted, 
we’re lucky!
Moran makes a good basket ball player—also, we would judge, he must 
be a good football player—that, after watching him fall upon the ball.
GIRLS! WORK ON THIS!
Things that work in another school should work at Carnogle Tech. After 
all things are considered, our school is very similar to other schools. We 
have a certain amount of spirit, and we lack a certain amount. We, like 
all other co-educational schools have a certain number of girls wiio are 
great boosters, and a large number who are not. This may bo due to in­
terest in other channels; to indifference; to a lack of knowledge of the 
teams, or, to a certain timidity.
Be that as it is, surely there ought to be some among our Maggie 
Murphs and Arts who have enough interest in the promulgation of a good 
spirit among the girls, and lack that timidity, to be willing to work on this 
following idea.
We know of many schools and colleges in the country who have Girl 
Cheer Leaders to lead the girl rooters. So why not Carnegie Tech? All it 
needs is the right girl. Surely, our girls boast of that right girl!
Listen “Maggie,” you beat Thiel once, but that doesn’t moan you’ll beat 
them twice. Thiel is out for revenge, but being somewhat ol’ a skeptical 
sort, we don’t think they’ll get it. In other words, we believe In the Girls’ 
Varsity. You played good against Westminster—just keep it up!
A FEW REPEATED
Some so-called Carnegie Tech men still "boo” at the referee. As was 
said last week "Throw ’em out”—they are not representative Carnegie Tech 
men. Carnegie Tech cannot afford to have her name besmirched by such 
tactics of rowdyism. A college man is supposed to represent gentlomanly 
conduct. Is that gentlemanly? College men are supposed to be good sports. 
Are you such when you hoot the referee?
A strong desire has been incubated within our souls to shako hands with 
Mr. Spring-time—has anybody seen him? If any person is so lucky as to get 
a glimpse of him, make a flying tackle, and DON’T MISS!

Ray spectrum. It was shown that 
the gap between X-Ray spectra and 
the ultra-violet spectra obtained with 
gratings has been closed.
On Thursday afternoon, March 2nd, 
Professor G. Becknell of the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh, gave an interest­
ing account of Crehore’s theory of tho 
action. An important part of his the­
ory is a very great simplification of

CARNEGIE ENDS SEASON
WITH TWO VICTORIES

of 20. Referee — Baird. Umpire—

Tech led from the start of the Beth­
any game and the visitors never suc­
ceeded in gaining the lead, although 
several times they threatened to do 
so. The play was fast, but not sen­
sational in this half and the half end­
ed with Tech leading by the score of 
19-11.
Anderson replaced Nelson at for­
ward at the start of the second half. 
Tech then proceeded to score 3 field
goals in the first two minutes of play 
and the Toch rooters had visions of 
a victory- by a large score, but Beth­
any settled down and this rapid fire 
scoring was stopped. Tho game ended 
with Teclv in tho lead by 10 points, 
the score being 35-25.
Captain Gibson and Moran played 
a superb game for Toch, while Gep- 
ford starred for Bothany, his close 
guarding keeping Tech’s score down 
and by fast work lie succeeded in 
breaking up the Tech offensive many 
times. "Ducky” Allen and Hennlnger

The girls team from Westminster 
College repeated tlieir first victory 
over the “Maggie Murphs and Arts” 
in their return game, played Friday 
afternoon in Tech Gym. The two 
teams were evenly matched, which 
worked for a good game throughout, 
though once tho lead was taken by 
Westminster, they were never 
headed. Their passing and shooting 
while not better than that of the 
Carnegie Tech girls, was of suffi­
cient importance to get the one point 
necessary to win. Perhaps the single 
item that paved the way for their 
victory can be traced to no desire 
to steer clear of the over-head shot 
for one point, as was the case with 
the Carnegie Tech girls. Good 
guarding kept tho score down.
Miss Garvin and Miss Brothers 
both played good games for West­
minster while elen Reed and Isa- 
abeit Winner performed well for 
Carnegie Tech, shooting In hard 
luck, especially the latter. The 
guards of both teams were good.
The last game of the season will 
be played Saturday with Thiel at 
Thiel. The first game was won by 
Carnegie Tech 14 to 12, in a close 
and exciting game. Miss Eleanor 
Thomas played especially well for 
the Carnegie ginls in that game, and 
Iter absence will be felt very much, 
as has been the case since her ac­
cident at GeneVa.
Helen Reed, Isabel Winner, Flor­
ence Montgomery, Jean Eakin, 
sie Bulmer, Margaret Marlcey and 
Eleanor Graver will make the trip. 
The lineup will bo unchanged.
RIFLE TEAM COMES THROUGH

week as was expected, trimming the 
Cornell team by the score of 492 to 
48S. This is conclusive proof that tho 
team has rocovered from the slump of 
tho past fow woeks and points toward 
victory ovor Colgate this week.

Grimm, 98; Bylor, 98; I-Iamll, Thomp­
son, 97. Total, 492,
Tho Cornell lineup has not. boon 
recoivèd as yet.
Carnegie Plebes Win From 
Three Local Prep. Quintets
Showing a complete reversal of 
form from that which had character­
ised their recent defeats, the Carne­
gie Tech Plebes came through last 
week with victories over three of 
the best locnill prop school quintets.
On Tuesday afternoon on tho 170th 
Field Artillery lloor, tho Plebes took 
over the fast Slmdysldo Academy 
five by the score of 33 to 20. Sliady- 
sido, champions of Section II of the 
W. P. 1. A. L., was outplayed in 
every department of tho game. Mur- 
rary and Miftter showed up well ou 
offence, while Brooks’ guarding was 
well worthy of uoto.
On Wednesday night the Plebes 
traveled' to New Castle, and defeated 
the strong high school team of that 
town. Matter and Murray were again 
tho shining lights, with Eddie Gil­
bert, a new recruit, showing up weld 
on the defense. Stone was tho whole 
works for New* Castle, scoring all 
but four of his teams’ points1.
Friday night at Duquesne Univer­
sity the Plebes defeated the Duke 
Preps for tho secona time by a 
score of 48 to 25. The game was 
fast and rough from start ,to finish. 
Kid Murray ran wild scoring nine 
field goals, besides playing tho best 
floor game he has yet put up. Gil­
bert continued his good work of the 
•past two games and Matter counted 
18 out of 21 from tho foul line. As 
for defense, tlio Dukes wero held to 
four field goals, ail! but one of

But he’s really trying out
for Sales Manager
THE freshman who comes out for baseball 
manager and who sticks is learning a lesson 
which, whether or not it wins that honor for him, 
should win some honors in after life.
He will learn that his plugging on the diamond, 
his efforts four years hence to get the upper hand 
on his first job, and after that his striving to climb 
into the managerial and executive class are all 
part of the same game.
Now, just as ten years from now, he will 
to do many things that are hard, many things that 
are unpleasant. The more willing he is, the more 
work will other men put upon him. But by that 
lie grows.
The rewards after college are given on about the 
same basis as now. They go to the man who besides 
doingihis main job well, still has the Lime to reach 
out after other work and the spirit that masters it.
Here is where this comes home to you. Don’t 
be content with standing high in the classroom. 
Support your college activities and go after some 
campus honors too. This broadening of your 
interests will become a habit that in after life will 
prove a mighty big help.

the ¿excellent work the various Clan 
organizations are doing and empha­
sized the fact that ho has had tho 
pleasure of attending every annual

certainly no ono any bettor than Mr. 
Connolloy could have been chosen to 
do justice to Tech athletics. Dr. T. 
S. Balcor, acting president of the In­
stitution, made a very interesting 
speech In regard to the progress that 
Toch has made. Some of the few 
things touched upon were tho differ­
ent college 'faculty and students rep­
resenting those colleges, the adminis­
tration, student government, athlet­
ics, activities, etc,
Tho Clan was honored by having 
present Mr. J. A. Poyton, one of the 
five trustees of tho Carnegie Corpor­
ation Mr. Poyton spoko mostly of Mr.

nobly lived for tho sake of humanity. 
Mr. 0. L. Tilbroolc was then called 
upon to give a short talk on alumni 
work. Ho spoko of tho progross that 
tho Alumni Association has made, but 
pointed out many things that wo 
could Improve upon and asked for the 
hearty co-operation of tho Now York 
Clan In ovorcomlng those difficulties. 
Ho gave an outline of tlio program 
for Campus Week and urged as many 
members as possible to return to 
Tech for that period.
After tho various spooohos tho 
toastmaster asked every Carnegie 
man and woman to stand up and 
give their names, tho year of gradu­
ation, business connootlon? A three- 
piece orchestra was on band and 
dancing was enjoyed until midnight,

the final judgment as the Paris Prize 
Committee directs. During the first 
two years after his arrival in Europe 
he must submit at least eight regular 
problems In the first class of the 
Ecole des Beaux Arts, exclusive of 
the special concourse for prizes, be­
sides doing other work designated by 
the society. He must spend two and 
a half years in Europe.
The competitions aré open to all 
citizens of the United States under 
29 years of age. The competition is 
given on .July of the year.
There are two preliminary and ono 
final competition. The first prelim­
inary Is open to all competitors who 
submit a 12-hour sketch, which is to 
be executed in a private room with­
out any assistance. The design is 
Judged on the merits of the compo­
sition, although the quality of tho 
sketch and its presentation is al­
ways considered.
Out of all tho contestants of the 
first preliminary, five competitors 
and two alternates are picked to en­
ter the second preliminary, together 
with the fifteen who are exempt from
the first preliminary for high rank­
ing in Beaux Arts.
Only twenty-two men are expected 
to enter the second preliminary. This 
is taken in a private room for a
period of 24 hours, at the end of 
which time a rendered sketch is to 
be submitted.
Out of this group five men are 
picked, with the two alternates, to 
enter the final competition. These
contestants must make a preliminary
sketch in 36 consecutive hours,
which must be developed during the 
ten weeks which follow. The Es- 
quisse or sketch) must be adhered to, 
departure from same would put the 
man out of the competition.
Carnegie Tech is sure of having at 
least two men in the second prelim­
inary and perhaps more. It must be 
admitted that Carnegie Tech lias a 
very good chance to have one of its 
mon in the final competition.

During the Avar he served as war cor­

Baker promises that lie will give a 
rery interesting talk.
The possibility of arranging some 
plan whereby provision could be 
made to support a graduate manager 
of Non-Athletic Activities was dis­
cussed at some length. A committee 
composed of Bylor, Blesch and Nation 
was appointed to talk with different 
officials around school and investi­
gate all possibilities.
Since there were only five Plebes 
registering at the 'beginning of tho 
second semester who would come 
under Plebe regulations,, the recom­
mendation by the Four Schools’ Reg­
ulation Committee that they be excus­
ed from regulations after Qualifica­

Debating at a Technical Institute, 
bile unique, is an activity that 
should be encouraged for it provides 
training which is sadly lacking in 
the engineer of today. The technical 
fan gifted with this asset usually

lawyers and ministers is highly 
valuable and represents a type for 
whom there is always a demand.
