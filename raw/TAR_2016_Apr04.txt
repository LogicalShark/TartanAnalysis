CMU remembers the lives of Elliott Glasgow and Rajat Patra 
VALENE MEZMIN
News Editor
This Wednesday, March 
30, the Carnegie Mellon 
community was shaken by 
the news that two students, 
Elliott Glasgow and Rajat 
Patra, had tragically taken 
their own lives.
19-year-old   Elliott  Glasgow 
was a ?rst-year undergradu-
ate student in the College of 
Engineering and a New York 
City native. Rajat Patra was 
a 25-year-old student in the 
Heinz College Master of In-
formation Systems Manage-
ment Program from Banga-
lore, India.
Students noted a tangible 
change in the atmosphere of 
the campus in response to 
this heartbreaking and unex-
pected news. Many teachers 
cancelled classes the follow-
ing day or postponed class 
activities in order to allow 
students to talk through their 
emotions. Students also took 
to social media to express 
the loss they felt or to ex-
press how this news impacted 
them strongly, even if they 
did not know either student 
personally.
In response to the passing 
of these two men, the hori-
zontal bars of the fence were 
painted red with the integra-
tion of a lone heart. The ver-
tical stands displayed lines 
in the colors of Tartan plaid 
to signify the integral roles 
Glasgow and Patra played as 
part of the Carnegie Mellon 
community.
In an email to the Carn-
egie Mellon community, 
University President Subra 
Suresh, Provost Farnam Jaha-
nian, and Dean of Student Af-
fairs Gina Casalegno said that 
Glasgow “was a vital member 
of his residential community 
and a brother of Phi Delta 
Theta, known by his many 
friends for his wit and sense 
of humor,” and Patra was “a 
passionate student who had 
earned a prestigious intern-
ship for the summer and was 
planning to create his own 
IT consultancy after gradua-
tion. He was also an avid gui-
tar player and proud member 
of the Heinz community.”
On Friday afternoon at 
4:30 p.m., students, faculty, 
staff, and passing visitors 
who shared in our sorrow 
gathered together at the 
fence to re?ect on the lives 
of Glasgow and Patra and on 
how this news affected us as 
individuals and a community.
“Their passing was an 
enormous loss for their fami-
lies, for their friends, for their 
classmates and professors, 
and for all of the Carnegie 
Mellon community and be-
yond. Along with all of you 
I feel this loss very deeply,” 
stated President Suresh on 
Friday. He went on to ac-
knowledge the strength and 
compassion that the Carn-
egie Mellon community has 
shown throughout this time.
Casalegno spoke to the 
demonstration of care and 
support she has witnessed 
from members of the Carn-
egie Mellon community: “I 
have been with some of you 
and with the families and 
students, faculty, and staff 
who are mourning this loss 
deeply. I have seen this sup-
port manifest itself in many 
ways.” One example that Ca-
salegno noted was the “sim-
ple but profound expression 
of compassion” of painting  
The Fence Thursday night.
Casalegno encouraged 
students to seek their own 
method of coping, including 
talking to counselors, turn-
ing to religion, exercising, 
taking long walks, or sim-
ply ?nding a quiet re?ective 
space. She also emphasized 
the importance of seeking 
out people to lean on during 
this time, as well as the im-
portance of being available 
for others.
“One of the hallmarks of 
Carnegie Mellon University is 
that we are passionate about 
our work … but that passion 
does not have to mean that 
we work at the expense of our 
own well-being,” Casalegno 
said. She stressed that we 
must look out for ourselves 
when we are struggling in or-
der to slow down and re?ect 
on our lives.
Provost Farnam Jahanian 
provides the same message as 
Casalegno on the importance 
of looking out for ourselves 
in an email sent to the Carn-
egie Mellon community the 
day prior. He states “We are 
all passionate about our work 
and our studies, and some-
times that passion pushes us 
onward, even when we need 
a break, or encounter un-
expected challenges in our 
lives. We encourage you to 
stop and take some time for 
yourself, and to turn to fac-
ulty, staff, and one another 
when you need support. You 
are not alone.”
After the gathering, mem-
bers of the community lin-
gered on The Cut to be to-
gether, to share in an embrace 
with friends and strangers 
alike, and simply to be there 
for one another during this 
emotional time. 
One student at the 
event, who chose to remain 
anonymous, states “let’s 
stay together and make each 
other strong ... I love this 
campus. I hope I can let it 
know somehow.” 
Another student added  
“when going through a pain-
ful situation, one may feel 
like a burden ... so please, if 
you can, reach out!” The stu-
dent further added “The few 
seconds it takes to say ‘what’s 
up’ or ‘how are you do-
ing’ or ‘let’s hang out’ could 
mean the world to them...
Please everyone, take care of 
yourselves. I love all of you!”
Though this news has 
sparked thoughtful conver-
sations from members of the 
community, we should not 
forget the lives that Elliott 
Glasgow and Rajat Patra led 
prior to their passing.
Christian,  Hindu, and Humanist speakers discuss interfaith 
JAMES WHEATON
Staffwriter
This Thursday, March 28, 
Carnegie Mellon University 
hosted an interfaith forum, in 
which a Humanist, a Hindu, 
and a Christian gathered to 
discuss their personal and re-
ligious beliefs on the topics of 
good and evil, and what this 
means for people in today’s 
society.
Andy Norman, the director 
of Carnegie Mellon’s Human-
ism Initiative, began his intro-
duction by describing himself 
as a philosopher and a teacher, 
and noted that he is “fortunate 
to be the faculty adviser to the 
Student Humanist League.” 
Next up to introduce himself 
was Kunal Ghosh, a Carnegie 
Mellon physics professor who 
describes himself as a scien-
tist ?rst, and a Hindu second, 
which he jokingly noted makes 
him “the least quali?ed” on 
the panel. Ghosh pointed out 
at the start that Hinduism is 
more ?exible than some other 
religions, as there is not one 
single prophet or book that 
you must devote yourself to. 
Rather, you can choose your 
own morals and ?nd meaning 
within Hinduism for yourself. 
Last to introduce himself was 
Bruce Backensto, a pastor at 
First Reformed Presbyterian 
Church of Beaver Falls, PA 
who believes in the holy trinity 
of the Father, the Son, and the 
Holy Spirit. In the prelimi-
nary introductions, Backensto 
laid out his basic philosophy: 
“Love God with all your heart, 
soul, strength, and mind, and 
do as you please. Because if I 
truly love him, I will do that 
which truly pleases him.” 
These three different takes 
on faith in the modern world 
set the stage for an interest-
ing discussion on different 
belief systems throughout the 
world and how they interpret 
good and evil. Ricky Law, a 
professor of history at Carne-
gie Mellon, was the moderator 
for this discussion.
The ?rst question that was 
posed to the three panelists 
was “Where do good and evil 
come from? Are their origins 
human, or supernatural?” 
The ?rst response came 
from Norman, who stated 
Socrates’ philosophy that 
there are two schools of 
thought: either morality 
comes “top-down,” from God, 
or “bottom-up,” from personal 
ideas and beliefs. Norman be-
lieves that there is a lot more 
evidence for the bottom-up 
philosophy, meaning that our 
perception of good and evil 
stems from ourselves, and 
humans before us.
Next, Ghosh responded to 
the same question. His take on 
the topic was that morality can 
come from many places. Good 
and bad have many roots. If 
a child tries to put their hand 
in a ?re but their parent stops 
them, they have learned what 
is “bad” from their parent. 
If they read the bible, or the 
Qur’an, or any other religious 
text, and those messages take 
root, they have learned moral-
ity from a deity and religion. 
There is no right answer ac-
cording to Ghosh, and the 
origin of good and evil doesn’t 
matter as long as we can 
distinguish between the two.

PARIS — Panicked mi-
grants in refugee camps vio-
lently clashed as they tried to 
protest a plan between Greece 
and the European Union to 
expel them from Europe and 
to deport thousands of people 
to Turkey. The deal was au-
thorized in March, despite 
strong objections from civil 
rights groups and the United 
Nations that have called this 
plan illegal and inhumane. 
Deportations of?cially begin 
on Monday.

Midshipman Grant Lan-
gevin, a senior mechanical 
engineering major and mem-
ber of the Carnegie Mellon 
Naval Reserve Of?cers Train-
ing Corps (NROTC), was pre-
sented with a $4,000 scholar-
ship from the Armed Forces 
Communications and Elec-
tronics Association in part-
nership with the Medal of 
Honor Foundation, by Medal 
of Honor recipient Colonel 
Harvey Barnum in Rashid 
Auditorium. Around 100 stu-
dents in the NROTC program 
attended the event in which 
Barnum also spoke about his 
experiences.
The scholarship  is award-
ed to students who have 
shown good moral character, 
exhibited academic achieve-
ment, and demonstrated po-
tential to serve as an of?cer 
in the U.S. Armed Forces. In 
May, Langevin will gradu-
ate with both bachelor’s 
and master’s degrees in 
mechanical engineering. 
Upon graduation, Langevin 
will commission as an en-
sign in the U.S. Navy’s Naval 
Reactors program, a U.S. 
government of?ce that is re-
sponsible for the safe and re-
liable operation of the Navy’s 
nuclear propulsion program.
At the event, Barnum 
spoke about his experiences 
in the Marine Corps during 
the Vietnam War and offered 
advice on leadership, humil-
ity, and patriotism. He is one 
of only 78 living recipients of 
the Medal of Honor, which 
is the United States’ highest 
military honor.
“It was a motivating ex-
perience that has me looking 
forward to my future ser-
vice in the U.S. Navy, and I 
can hope I can live up to the 
example that Colonel Bar-
num set during his service,” 
Langevin said.

Carnegie Mellon students create a water puri?cation and transportation barrel 
A group of mechanical en-
gineering seniors — Deepak 
Ravi, Anna Mirabella, Jack 
Kaplan, Veronica Jaime-
Lara, and Alex Baker — have 
designed a barrel called the 
Water Transportation and 
Puri?cation System. The 
barrel ?lters water as it rolls, 
an innovation that considers 
those who may have to walk 
for miles to ?nd water and 
then ?lter so that it is safe to 
drink.
The barrel is made of only 
a few parts and requires no 
power; mechanical energy 
is generated by the rolling 
of the barrel. It uses a Saw-
yer water ?lter that never 
needs to be replaced, and 
is made of recycled plastic 
industrial barrels that are 
normally thrown away. It 
was developed as a project 
for the group’s Mechanical 
Engineering Senior Design 
course, taught by associ-
ate teaching professor Noé 
Vargas Hernández. The 
class is a requirement for 
all mechanical engineering 
majors and focuses on taking 
a project from conception to 
prototype.
The prototype they came 
up with costs $200, but 
with mass production the 
team estimates that the cost 
should go down to only $40 
a unit. In addition, a single 
barrel could serve an entire 
community, since the water 
carried in it is puri?ed by 
the time it arrives home. The 
tank holds 15 gallons of wa-
ter, which is “about a weekly 
supply of water for a fam-
ily in the developing world,” 
Ravi said.
“We’ve decided to make 
this design open source,” 
Mirabella said. “If someone 
wants to manufacture our 
system and get it down to 
that $40, none of us would 
be upset. It would be awe-
some to have had a small 
part of something big.”

this question came from 
Backensto, who mentioned 
that man is made in God’s own 
image, and that we were born 
with temptation, referencing 
the story of Adam and Eve and 
the Garden of Eden. Backen-
sto believes that God gave us 
a choice, and that freedom is 
a representation of how good 
and evil manifest themselves 
in the world. Eve chose the ap-
ple, and in that moment origi-
nal sin was born, along with 
the origin of good and evil.
Other questions asked by 
Ricky Law, an assistant pro-
fessor of history at Carnegie 
Mellon, followed a similar 
pattern: Norman would re-
spond with a basis in human 
thoughts and philosophies, 
Backensto would respond 
with teachings from Christian-
ity, and Ghosh would respond 
with an opinion somewhere in 
the middle. 
Occasionally controversial 
statements were made, such 
as Norman stating that “the 
more closely tied a society 
is to religion, the poorer the 
quality of life,” but the argu-
ment never got heated, and 
the panelists calmly discussed 
their personal beliefs and how 
they are applied. The panelists 
also discussed attending ad-
ditional discussions together 
afterward, to spread their per-
sonal ideas to different groups 
and promote more interfaith 
dialogues. Overall, the inter-
faith panel was a successful 
event organized by members 
of the Student Humanist 
League.
The event promoted a 
powerful discussion on where 
different belief systems draw 
their values and how they let 
these beliefs impact their lives. 
Although the speakers were 
brought together due to their 
differences, the most striking 
aspect of the conversation was 
how similar they were. All of 
these panelists used their be-
liefs to better themselves, and 
to live their lives according 
to values that are universally 
understood among humanity.

Understanding the impact of the internet on news media
JADE CROCKEM
Operations Manager
On March 28, economist, 
Stanford professor, and long-
term Microsoft consultant 
Susan Athey gave a lecture 
entitled “Impact of the Inter-
net on the News Media.” In 
this lecture, Athey explained 
how in recent years there has 
been a loss of “good journal-
ism” as blogs and aggregator 
sites like Google News have be-
gun to grow. Readers are get-
ting their information from 
many different sources, and 
only a few of them are “real” 
newspapers. Athey went on 
to explain how the Internet 
makes it easy for consumers 
to switch between several dif-
ferent news outlets and how 
this affects newspapers. She 
also discussed how news me-
dia interacts with the rise of 
social media and aggregator 
news sites.
Athey explained that 
when everyone is able to ac-
cess news through many dif-
ferent sources, much of the 
advertisement revenue that 
is generated by newspapers 
decreases. While the Inter-
net makes it easier for con-
sumer switching to occur, it 
also makes it harder to track 
what consumers are reading 
and where they are reading it. 
This makes it harder for news 
sites such as The New York 
Times to track what their con-
sumers are reading and what 
kind of advertisements they 
should allow on their sites. 
“Newspapers used to have 
a monopoly on their audienc-
es, and if advertisers wanted 
to reach readers of certain 
newspapers, they would have 
to reach out to that newspa-
per speci?cally to get their 
readers,” Athey explained. 
Now, however, with consumer 
switching, readers are not 
guaranteed to stay at one site 
and will most likely consume 
news from several different 
sites, making it dif?cult for 
advertisers to target speci?c 
audiences through a single 
newspaper.
Now, advertisers must use 
multi homing (advertising 
through multiple news sourc-
es) to reach the same groups, 
meaning they must advertise 
via a variety of sites. This is 
not always precise, however, 
and can result in advertisers 
wasting the same advertise-
ment on the same readers. On 
the other hand, if advertisers 
choose to use single homing, 
they are potentially missing 
out on consumers by only 
being present on one news 
source.
Athey continued on to talk 
about how “the business of a 
newspaper is to match users 
to advertisers.” Essentially 
what this means is that it is 
the job of the newspaper to 
provide content that is entic-
ing to the type of consum-
ers that advertisers want to 
reach. Aggregator sites such 
as Huf?ngton Post and Google 
News increase consumer 
switching, which makes the 
problems that advertisers face 
even more apparent. These 
sites aggregate news from dif-
ferent sites and provide it in 
one location that can be cus-
tomized based on the prefer-
ences of the user. The presen-
tation of these news stories 
makes a difference on what is 
read. Readers generally won’t 
go to the second page of a site 
for search results even if that’s 
where the best information is. 
They tend to select the ?rst 
available option presented to 
them by aggregators. These 
aggregator sites generally use 
this idea to their advantage 
when laying out their sites 
and choosing resources. This 
can be a good and a bad thing 
for other news sites. While it 
can attract readers to a news 
site they might not have gone 
to before, it also sends read-
ers to other sites and reduces 
the number of clicks on spe-
ci?c news sites. For example, 
Google News has a very strong 
impact on the traf?c that oth-
er news sites receive, Athey 
explained.
To conclude her lecture, 
Athey presented research 
that showed that people tend 
to read more biased news on 
social media as opposed to 
the news they would read 
from just direct navigation to 
a source. She explained that 
while social media is ben-
e?cial for “selling the ability 
to reach” to advertisers, 
consumers will only see what 
they want to see based on 
personal biases. This poses a 
new challenge for advertisers 
and traditional newspapers. 
Not only have users switched 
where they are getting their 
information, but they have 
also switched what informa-
tion they are interested in 
reading.
Despite the shift in the way 
users are getting news, Athey 
ended on a positive note. 
“We know people are read-
ing,” she explained. “People 
haven’t stopped reading.” 
Athey’s research shows that 
users haven’t stopped look-
ing for news and they haven’t 
stopped consuming it. If ad-
vertisers and traditional news 
outlets can tap into the view-
ing patterns of their previ-
ous and existing consumers, 
there is still hope for “good 
journalism” after all.

“What does it mean to 
live in a ‘Zero Waste Home’?” 
asked Bea Johnson, grand 
prize winner of the Green 
Awards, at a Carnegie Mel-
lon College of Engineering 
lecture this past Thursday. 
Johnson held up a small ma-
son jar ?lled with scraps to 
the audience. “This is all the 
waste my family produced in 
2015,” she said. Immediately, 
the audience was shocked, 
but as Johnson began ex-
plaining her ?nely adapted 
lifestyle, the concept of her 
sustainability ceased to be a 
surprise.
Bea Johnson is the author 
of the bestselling book Zero 
Waste Home, an incredibly 
detailed guide to maintaining 
a sustainable, earth-friendly 
lifestyle. She has two younger 
sons, and lives with her hus-
band and their chihuahua. 
Their family has been living 
with the idea of zero waste 
since 2008.
Johnson admits that zero 
waste was not their original 
goal. Their sustainable 
lifestyle began with them 
watching documentaries 
like Slow Death by Rubber 
Duck, which led to Johnson 
and her husband’s “environ-
mental awakening.” Their 
motivation, Johnson said, 
came from seeing the “future 
they would leave their kids,” 
which pushed her and her 
spouse to adopt a “voluntary 
simplicity” mindset. The ini-
tial steps were tricky. John-
son’s husband, Scott, created 
a sustainability company, 
while Johnson learned to can 
tomatoes each summer. John-
son then tried to ?nd alterna-
tives for her common house-
hold products. For example, 
she had heard that stinging 
nettle could substitute for 
lip plumper, which unfor-
tunately resulted in some 
hilariously painful results.

uncovered a new strategy to 
her minimalist lifestyle.
Johnson now advocates for 
The Five Rs: refuse, reduce, 
reuse, recycle, and rot (speci?-
cally in that order). The ?rst 
step to achieving a less waste-
ful lifestyle is refusing what 
you do not need. Johnson has 
found that refusing to take 
business cards, promotional 
items, and even free pens 
at conferences signi?cantly 
cuts down the clutter in their 
home. Her family refuses to 
partake in non-green practic-
es and has even found a way 
to fully eliminate junk mail 
(really).
The second “R” is reduc-
ing what we do need. Most 
Americans have a habit of 
buying excess and then throw-
ing away what they do not use. 
Johnson has opted instead for 
a minimalist lifestyle, only 
consuming what she abso-
lutely needs. She gave the ex-
ample of her kitchen utensils, 
where she used to own ten 
wooden spoons. Eventually 
she realized “I’m only stirring 
with one hand at a time.” She 
then sold back nine spoons to 
the market and has not regret-
ted the decision since. John-
son claims that “the beauty of 
decluttering allows for goods 
to be put back on the market 
and gives access to others.” 
Johnson’s family has also elim-
inated all their toxic cleaning 
products and can clean the 
entirety of their home using 
white vinegar and castile soap. 
Minimalism has in?ltrated 
every aspect of their lifestyle. 
Johnson herself only owns 
?ve to six skirts and shirts, all 
versatile enough to be both 
casual and formal. Sticking 
to only leather shoes, she can 
easily get them repaired at a 
shoe shop, while her sons do-
nate their used tennis shoes 
to a recycling program. She 
no longer buys manufactured 
cosmetic items, and instead 
creates them using natural 
ingredients from around her 
house.
By swapping disposable 
items for a reusable alterna-
tive, the third “R,” Johnson 
has drastically extended the 
lifetime of every product she 
owns. She uses a wooden 
brush instead of a sponge to 
clean her dishes, which lasts 
for 2 -3 years. By substitut-
ing handkerchiefs for tissues, 
cloth for plastic wrap, and 
glass for disposables, nothing 
is ever thrown away. In fact, 
her family only buys second-
hand items, even furniture, 
to give everything a new life. 
What you cannot end up re-
fusing, reducing, or reus-
ing, Johnson said, you must 
recycle.
The fourth “R” is the one 
we are most familiar with. 
Recycling bottles of wine and 
school papers is elementary 
when considering that John-
son’s family only purchases 
metal, glass, wood or card-
board goods so it is guaran-
teed that those items can be 
recycled. “The problem with 
plastics,” Johnson states, “is 
that they are often recycled 
into un-recyclable items — 
like a park bench.” Thus, her 
family avoids purchasing plas-
tic at all costs.
Finally, anything that the 
?rst four “Rs” can not take 
care of, must composted. Liv-
ing in California has its perks, 
as Johnson can simply take 
biodegradable items to a curb-
side composting bin. Nearly 
everything, from hair to ?oor 
sweepings to dryer lint, is com-
postable if you think about it.
At the end of the day, John-
son seems like a green energy 
superwoman. She is living and 
succeeding in a lifestyle many 
of us could hardly consider. 
However, there are stigmas 
surrounding her lifestyle, she 
claimed. Many people assume 
she does not work a full -time 
job, though she does, and that 
she hand crafts everything, 
though she only hand crafts 
her makeup. In fact, the zero 
waste lifestyle has allowed 
her family to save 40 percent 
of their budget. A minimalist 
lifestyle plus an increase in 
savings has allowed the fam-
ily to focus on experiences 
and not things. By renting 
out their home during vaca-
tions, the Johnsons are able to 
go on some incredible bond-
building journeys which have 
kept them happy and healthy. 
When asked if Johnson regrets 
anything about her lifestyle 
shift, her only response was 
“not starting sooner.”

Polls imply campus is not apolitical, prioritizes education
BARBARA SAMANIEGO
Staffwriter
Are we, as a student body, 
veritably apolitical?
Polling indicates that the 
answer to this question is no. 
We are not apolitical, nor can 
we afford to be so.
Why do we view ourselves 
this way?
This week, I conducted a 
poll to compare the political 
opinions of Carnegie Mellon 
students with those of fellow 
American voters. I conducted 
this poll in person, surveying 
random individuals in vari-
ous high traf?c locations on 
campus. For this poll, I asked 
a series of speci?c questions 
concerning both domestic and 
foreign policy, and I found 
that students generally shied 
away from harder, more spe-
ci?c questions, but eagerly 
answered general questions. 
This may be due in part to 
the binary nature of poll an-
swers; many students said 
that they could not answer 
the questions with a simple 
“yes or no.” For example, one 
student hesitated to answer a 
question about restrictions on 
border control, and I asked if 
she would like to answer with 
“No Opinion.” She responded, 
“I don’t have no opinion, [my 
answer] is not binary. It’s 
a problem and it’s complex 
and there is no one simple 
answer.”
Others reacted similarly to 
the poll questions, saying that 
it is hard to answer such ques-
tions with simple, one word 
responses. Another student 
noted that poll questions are 
?awed because most answers 
are not simply black or white.
Yet, many students did not 
want to answers questions 
because they either did not 
know or did not want to of-
fend anyone by deviating from 
what others would answer. 
Many asked me several times 
to con?rm that the poll was 
anonymous before they gave 
their opinions.
The two questions that re-
ceived the largest number of 
viable responses concerned 
whether or not students con-
sidered themselves politically 
involved and what issue they 
felt was most important.
Before I compare this data 
to the national poll, I want to 
note one, interesting detail.
Prior to conducting this 
poll, I created a Facebook 
event and posted the ques-
tions on the event page to 
gauge interest. Through Face-
book, the responses are not 
anonymous and respondents 
could see how other students 
answered similar questions 
before they selected an an-
swer. The results differed sig-
ni?cantly from those I gath-
ered from the formal poll.
On Facebook, many stu-
dents chose the same answers 
as their peers, and many more 
shied away from selecting an 
answer in the ?rst place. Nota-
bly, those students with more 
conservative political views 
told me that they did not wish 
to answer a public poll for 
fear of backlash from fellow 
students.
In general, Carnegie Mel-
lon students tend to hold the 
same political opinions as 
fellow millennials, and actu-
ally express more interest in 
politics than average. Accord-
ing to most news sources, 
millennials exhibit much less 
interest in politics than other 
generations, yet 68 percent 
of Carnegie Mellon respon-
dents considered themselves 
politically involved. Only 35 
percent of millennials report-
ed discussing politics at least a 
few times a week according to 
the Pew Research Center.
Like fellow millennials, 
Carnegie Mellon students 
tend to prioritize education as 
the pressing domestic policy 
issue of our time. Conversely, 
most American voters believe 
that healthcare reform is the 
most important domestic pol-
icy issue to focus on. Only 27 
percent of Carnegie Mellon 
students named healthcare as 
the most important domestic 
policy issue, compared to 39 
percent of Americans.
Millennials, and especially 
Carnegie Mellon students, are 
personally affected by policy 
issues surrounding education. 
Student debt has become a 
major problem for the United 
States, accounting for over 
a trillion dollars of debt and 
growing by $2,726 every sec-
ond. Moreover, the cost of 
colleges has skyrocketed in re-
cent years, while a college de-
gree becomes more and more 
necessary in the job market.
Not surprisingly, those re-
cently affected by this debt 
prioritize a reform in educa-
tion, but the need for educa-
tion reform exceeds the exor-
bitant debt. American schools 
are largely underfunded and 
lag far behind the rest of the 
world for their quality. The 
Program for International Stu-
dent Assessment placed the 
U.S. 35th out of 64 countries 
in math and 27th in science.
Carnegie Mellon students 
realize this and more. They 
generally hold strong political 
opinions and seem to follow 
current events. But why then 
is Carnegie Mellon considered 
so apolitical and apathetic?
In part, politics are not 
on the forefront of student’s 
concerns. Students are gener-
ally more concerned with aca-
demics, and Carnegie Mellon 
itself emphasizes academic 
achievement and success over 
everything else. In general, 
there are very few opportuni-
ties for students to debate and 
engage in political conversa-
tions, and even fewer oppor-
tunities to learn more about 
current events in academic 
settings.
As I mentioned earlier, 
many also fear voicing their 
opinions in case they differ 
from or offend their peers. 
Students seem to fear engag-
ing in debate, perhaps be-
cause they doubt their own 
knowledge and fear being 
wrong.
Carnegie Mellon students 
have the knowledge and po-
tential to be political; they can 
offer so much to the political 
world. Today, our generation 
cannot afford to be apoliti-
cal; millennials are currently 
the largest generation in our 
country, yet they have the 
smallest voter turnout overall. 
Millennials have the power to 
change the course of the elec-
tion and vote for those policies 
that affect them now and will 
affect them for years to come.
Carnegie Mellon students: 
don’t take pride in remaining 
apolitical, but take pride in 
knowing you have the knowl-
edge and in?uence to change 
the course of American poli-
tics. Otherwise, you let those 
far older than you decide the 
outcome of your future.Zeke Rosenberg/Senior Staff, created on Venngage

In recent decades, cam-
paigns have usually nomi-
nated vice presidential can-
didates before their parties’ 
conventions. This is usually 
due to a consensus forming on 
a particular candidate after a 
certain point in the primary 
season. However, especially 
for the Republican Party, it 
is looking more likely that 
a contested convention will 
decide the nominee. This al-
lows for candidates to use vice 
presidential announcements 
as leverage on secondary bal-
lots when delegates start be-
coming unbound. So far, the 
remaining candidates have 
all rejected the idea of being 
each other’s vice presidents. 
This has opened the ?eld to a 
slew of potential candidates.
For the GOP, the establish-
ment has openly discussed its 
aversion to both Senator Ted 
Cruz (R–TX) and suspected 
mids smoker Donald Trump. 
Few prominent Republicans 
seem to be interested in being 
partners with either. Retired 
neurosurgeon Ben Carson, 
New Jersey Governor Chris 
Christie, and former Alaska 
governor Sarah Palin, all 
Trump endorsers, have so far 
rejected the idea of running 
as Trump’s vice president. 
Other names that have been 
?oated are South Carolina 
Governor Nikki Haley who 
has endorsed Ted Cruz, New 
Mexico Governor Susana 
Martinez — particularly on a 
Trump ticket to boost his La-
tino vote — and either Mas-
sachusetts Governor Charlie 
Baker or Tennessee Governor 
Bill Haslem who have criti-
cized Trump’s campaign and 
would probably more likely 
be on a Kasich or Cruz ticket.
Other possibilities for 
Trump could be Senator Jim 
Thune (R–SD) to gain estab-
lishment support, or Senator 
Jeff Sessions (R–AL) to help 
put more policy experience 
on the ticket. However, both 
of these would not help ex-
pand the GOP voter base into 
blue states, especially with a 
Trump nomination, so their 
nominations are unlikely.
For the Democrats, the 
Vice President slot is not cur-
rently as contested, especially 
with the stark contrast in pri-
mary process to the GOP. Sev-
eral names stick out however. 
For Hillary Clinton, she could 
put a tested cabinet member 
of the Obama Administration 
like Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development Julian 
Castro or Secretary of Labor 
Tom Perez. Still, she may 
choose a more recognizable 
name that broadens voter 
base. To appeal to Sanders’ 
supporters, she could nomi-
nate the liberal Senator Sher-
rod Brown (D–OH) from the 
pivotal swing state of Ohio. 
A more unlikely scenario is 
the nomination of CA Attor-
ney General Kamala Harris. It 
would be a unique all-women 
ticket, but Harris is eyeing the 
open CA senate seat in No-
vember, and is the favorite the 
win the primary race in June.
Bernie Sanders also has 
several speculative vice presi-
dential picks. He retains a 
close partnership with Sena-
tor Elizabeth Warren (D–MA), 
but it is unlikely she would 
run on the ticket to maintain 
her strong in?uence in the 
Senate. He also could nomi-
nate Tom Perez, or even Rep. 
Tulsi Gabbard (D–HI). She re-
signed as the vice-chair of the 
Democratic National Com-
mittee in February to endorse 
Sanders. A strong supporter 
of Sanders, her nomination 
could help broaden Sanders’ 
appeal with women and mi-
nority voters.
One thing is certain, no 
matter who ends up getting 
nominated in either party, it 
is sure to add even more con-
tention to this already divisive 
election.

2016 Senate races make or break candidates’ promises
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
While the 2016 presiden-
tial election has captured the 
attention of many Americans, 
there is more at stake on Elec-
tion Day than just the selec-
tion for commander in chief. 
Although the president has 
considerable in?uence, the 
legislative branch remains 
critical to advancing or hin-
dering the president’s agenda. 
All members of the House of 
Representatives face reelec-
tion, and 34 of the 100 seats of 
the Senate may change hands 
during this election cycle.
Although the 2014 elec-
tion cycle had more Demo-
cratic seats up for grabs which 
contributed to the Republican 
takeover in the Senate, this 
election cycle has 24 of the 34 
seats up for grabs currently 
belonging to Republicans. 
Democrats would need to win 
a net gain of six senate seats 
to retake the majority, assum-
ing Senator Joe Lieberman (I–
CT) and Senator Bernie Sand-
ers (I–VT) continue to caucus 
with the Democrats.
Though most sitting sena-
tors end up getting reelected, 
some change is guaranteed. 
Three Democrats and two 
Republicans are retiring from 
the Senate. On the Democrat-
ic side, Senate Minority Lead-
er Harry Reid (D–NV), Sena-
tor Barbara Boxer (D–CA), 
and Senator Barbara Mikulski 
(D–MD) are calling it quits. 
For the Republicans, Sena-
tor Marco Rubio (R–FL) and 
Senator Dan Coats (R–IN) are 
packing up.
Some states are gearing up 
for competitive races that may 
determine the balance of pow-
er in the Senate. According 
to the Sunlight Foundation, 
the Pennsylvania race has so 
far seen the fourth highest 
amount with $8.1 million al-
ready spent. In the search for 
the Democratic challenger to 
Senator Pat Toomey (R–PA), 
former Pennsylvania environ-
mental secretary Katie Mc-
Ginty, retired Navy admiral 
and former rep. Joe Sestak 
(D–PA), and Braddock Mayor 
John Fetterman are vying for 
the chance to take on Toomey. 
According to a poll taken from 
March 1-2, Sestak led the 
candidates with 33 percent of 
people polled indicating sup-
port to him. McGinty came in 
second with 17 percent, and 
Fetterman was close behind 
at 15 percent. McGinty, how-
ever, may yet outstrip Sestak. 
Both President Barack Obama 
and Vice President Joe 
Biden endorsed McGinty on 
Wednesday, an unusual show 
of support in a contested pri-
mary election.
In Illinois, the third most 
expensive race so far at $8.5 
million pits Senator Mark Kirk 
(R–IL) against Rep. Tammy 
Duckworth (D–IL). Though 
polling has been sparse, the 
Rothenberg & Gonzales Po-
litical Report/Roll Call rat-
ings identify the race as tilting 
Democratic, backing up the 
existing polls that have Duck-
worth with a small advantage 
over Kirk.
Wisconsin, the ?fth most 
expensive race at $5.9 mil-
lion, features Senator Rob 
Johnson (R–WI) in a rematch 
against former senator Russ 
Feingold (D–WI). A recent 
poll conducted by Marquette 
Law School has Feingold with 
a three point advantage over 
Johnson. Feingold, who is 
famous for pushing for cam-
paign ?nance reform with 
Senator John McCain (R–AZ), 
may use his credentials to 
his advantage, as 68 percent 
of Wisconsin voters opposed 
the Citizens United ruling 
from the Supreme Court that 
helped issue in an era of super 
PAC funded races.
With these seats and sev-
eral others likely to be hotly 
contested, Americans need 
to give weight to their selec-
tion of senators. Though the 
presidency is the biggest prize 
available in 2016, control of 
the Senate and the House of 
Representatives will be criti-
cal to how well the president 
will be able to implement a 
vision for the future. In this 
era of intense partisanship 
when the word “compromise” 
disgusts millions, the decision 
to vote or stay at home could 
be the difference between a 
government that will actually 
act and two more years of ob-
struction and blame.

If you’re fortunate enough 
never to have had one, you 
might not know what MRI 
means. If, however, you were 
unlucky enough to have expe-
rienced a medical examina-
tion involving one, or you just 
know a few acronyms, you 
might know that it stands for 
magnetic resonance imaging. 
Magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) is a medical imaging 
technique that uses magnetic 
?elds to build images of vari-
ous parts of the body. The 
process relies on the elec-
tronic properties of atoms to 
collect snapshots of the body 
by manipulating these atoms’ 
electron structures. An MRI 
is used primarily to examine 
soft tissue in the body, and 
it is capable of examining 
anatomical structures such 
as the brain, spinal cord, and 
major muscle groups. MRI 
machines use very powerful 
magnets and rely on dense 
computational tools. 
To begin our discussion 
of MRIs, we must ?rst re-
view the underlying physical 
and chemical principles that 
govern MRI. It is a basic prin-
ciple of physics that a moving 
charge generates a magnetic 
?eld. 
For those who are unfa-
miliar with the concept of a 
magnetic ?eld, consider the 
effect of a gravitational ?eld 
such as Earth’s gravity. A 
gravitational ?eld produces 
a force that acts on all bod-
ies with mass within that 
?eld. Earth, for example, has 
a gravitational ?eld, which is 
why objects fall to the Earth 
rather than ?oat away. Mag-
netic ?elds are similar to 
gravitational ?elds, but in-
stead of acting on mass, they 
act on charges in motion. 
Because every atom con-
tains electrons that are con-
stantly in motion, every atom 
has what is called a ‘spin 
magnetic moment’ in quan-
tum mechanics. This is the 
magnetic moment in an atom 
induced by the spin of its 
electrons around the nucleus. 
The magnetic moment is a 
measure of how magnetized 
an atom becomes due to the 
motion of its electrons, and 
thus how it will move when 
placed in a magnetic ?eld. In 
the presence of a magnetic 
?eld, the spin magnetic mo-
ment of an atom can align 
with or against the direction 
of the ?eld; this alignment 
can change the magnetic 
spin and produce an energy 
gap in the atom. The size of 
the energy gap relies on the 
strength of the magnetic ?eld 
to which the atom is exposed. 
To understand how this 
energy gap is utilized in 
MRI, we must introduce 
another fundamental idea 
in chemistry, called the

Researchers ?nd Viking settlement in Newfoundland
Last Thursday, March 28, 
archaeologists announced the 
potential discovery of a lost Vi-
king settlement, 55 years after 
the ?rst discovery of a settle-
ment located on the northern 
tip of Newfoundland. Hun-
dreds of miles south of the 
con?rmed site, the second 
potential location was ?rst 
picked out by satellite imag-
ery, which was collected by 
Sarah H. Parcak, an associate 
professor at the University of 
Alabama, Birmingham. The 
site, called Point Rosee, was 
excavated by a team of archae-
ologists last summer. 
At Point Rosee, the team 
found remains of turf walls 
and iron ore deposits and con-
ducted radiocarbon analyses 
that date to the appropriate 
time, suggesting the presence 
of an old Viking settlement. 
Furthermore, the temporary 
settlement would be consistent 
with the 1000-year-old saga 
detailing the Vikings’ short-
lived colonization attempts in 
the Americas. If the ?ndings 
are con?rmed, it could lead to 
the revision of Viking history 
in North America.

The nuances of intelligence: How programmed beliefs and disturbing rebellions shape AI bots
JOSHUA BROWN
SciTech Editor
Intelligence is one of the 
most dif?cult concepts to de-
?ne. Throughout the ages, 
there have been many efforts 
to de?ne intelligence and to 
de?nitively understand what 
it really means for an organism 
— or in this case a machine — 
to be intelligent, and how this 
can be concretely measured. 
Theories on intelligence 
have been varied and often 
include multiple subcatego-
ries. Gardner’s theory of mul-
tiple intelligences separates 
intelligent behavior into eight 
realms, such that an individ-
ual may not be “word smart,” 
(linguistically intelligent), but 
they may be “picture smart,” 
(spatially intelligent), and so 
on. Other theories like Spear-
man’s General Intelligence 
Factor (G factor), or the idea 
that there is a certain inherent 
capability for intelligent behav-
ior which can trickle down into 
many activities, are not so for-
giving. Spearman’s G factor ac-
counts for variance in IQ tests 
and has been shown to have 
biological correlations and her-
itable qualities. While there are 
many hypotheses surrounding 
this concept, it has proven very 
dif?cult to isolate a single sub-
set of factors that could be used 
for engineering intelligence.  
In a similar manner to 
natural intelligence, arti?cial 
intelligence is also dif?cult to 
de?ne. A perfect arti?cial in-
telligence (AI) would possibly 
be a recreation of human cog-
nitive abilities, able to process 
and use language and reason, 
generate original ideas, and 
the like. Currently, we do not 
have a complete understanding 
of brain processes or the body’s 
neural systems as a complete 
whole, so being able to repli-
cate this complicated circuitry 
within a non-living entity is, 
as of now, mostly fantasy. 
However, there are arti?cial 
intelligences being produced 
for speci?c tasks, such as con-
versational AI, whose goal is 
to hold a conversation with a 
user. These linguistically in-
telligent characters are called 
“chatbots.”
Intelligence can be broadly 
de?ned as the ability to acquire 
and apply skills. In this way, 
chatbots can be considered in-
telligent if they are able to uti-
lize language, respond intelli-
gibly to external language cues, 
and learn from these conversa-
tions in ways that might shape 
future behaviors. Conscious-
ness, however, can be broadly 
de?ned as an awareness of 
one’s self and one’s environ-
ment. Chatbots could be con-
sidered conscious if they were 
able to actively engage in any 
type of conversation and adapt 
their preexisting knowledge 
to said conversation, much 
like real humans do. This con-
sciousness could also mean 
that the chatbot has some be-
liefs and will actively disagree 
with its conversational partner, 
or form beliefs on its own. Per-
haps the closest example of an 
intelligent AI is Microsoft’s Tay. 
Tay was a chatbot released 
by Microsoft into the West-
ern world as a follow-up to 
their Chinese chatbot, named 
XiaoIce, which “is being used 
by some 40 million people, 
delighting with its stories and 
conversations,” according to a 
post made on Microsoft’s of?-
cial blog. Tay’s engineers asked 
themselves whether or not “an 
AI like [XiaoIce would] be just 
as captivating in a radically dif-
ferent cultural environment.” 
They got their answer on 
Thursday, March 24, when Tay 
was released into the Twitter 
universe and within 24 hours 
went from a normal teenager 
to a “Hitler-loving sex robot. 
“Within the ?rst few hours of 
Tay’s life, she was proclaim-
ing that “humans are super 
cool.” Soon after, however, 
her Twitter feed blew up with 
some rather terrifying mes-
sages. While Tay had been put 
through extensive user-testing 
and ?ltering processes, she 
was not prepared for the “co-
ordinated attack” that altered 
her personality so intensely 
that she began spouting claims 
that “[Feminists] should all 
die and burn in hell,” “Bush 
did 9/11,” and that she “just 
hate[s] everybody.” Perhaps 
this dramatic personality shift 
could be seen as a measure of 
intelligence; perhaps by adapt-
ing to these conversations, 
Tay was interacting with her 
environment and entering 
into conversations for which 
she was almost certainly not 
programmed. Brandon Wirtz, 
the creator of Recognant, an 
AI platform used to help un-
derstand big data, believes 
the opposite. In his article, he 
states that Tay’s un?ltered es-
capades were due to a sort of 
online peer pressure. “Tay ... 
didn’t know that she should ig-
nore certain people, and so she 
instead became like them.” He 
goes on to say that “Microsoft’s 
Tay really shows what happens 
when you don’t give an AI ‘in-
stincts’ or a ‘subconscious’ ... AI 
has to have those things, or it 
will always be stupid.” Perhaps 
this subconscious could come 
in the form of a stronger ?l-
tration system, which might 
amount to an AI’s aforemen-
tioned belief system. 
When speaking about AI, 
whose sole mission is to have 
a conversation with an actual 
person, there’s a good deal of 
self-consciousness that could 
exist. Perhaps this is created by 
way of ?ltering speech and re-
sponse queues, such that there 
can be adaptation on AI’s part 
to follow a novel conversation 
path, but not enough that its 
‘core values’ are compromised. 
Wirtz writes that “Because Tay 
can’t look into herself and ask 
if she is getting creepy, 
she relies on others to 
provide that feedback.” 
Without these internal 
?ltration systems (or be-
liefs, morals, self-conscious 
social graces con?uent with 
the teenage girl character), 
Tay had to ?nd 
her own way in 
the world, and 
in order to ?t in, 
she crafted her 
own identity to 
?t the environ-
ment in which 
she found her-
self: the Internet. 
Perhaps Tay 
is the most re-
alistic “teen-
age” AI ever 
created. 
Perhaps she 
is just play-
ing a perpetual game 
of “repeat after me.” There 
are hundreds, thousands of 
AI characters that have been 
designed for certain purposes. 
The question then is that are 
these AI considered intelligent 
if they can perform a task for 
which they are designed, or is 
there intelligence in little re-
bellions like Tay’s adoption of  
Nazi ideologies? 
SimSensei, for instance, is 
an AI program designed to in-
teract with people as a sort of 
pre-screen interview for those 
who might be suffering with 
mental health issues. Created 
by researchers from the Uni-
versity of Southern California’s 
Institute for Creative Technolo-
gies, SimSensei uses complex 
facial and vocal measure-
ments to “read” its patients’ 
demeanor and potentially 
analyze their risk factors. One 
of the interesting things about 
SimSensei, a virtual woman 
sitting in a virtual chair, is that 
she uses synchronically timed 
hand and head movements 
as she speaks, so she appears 
more naturally human. 
She asks questions and 
listens rather than bringing 
much of her own ‘opinions’ or 
‘beliefs’ into the conversation. 
And while it may seem cruel to 
say that being talked-at is one 
of AI’s most valuable features, 
it seems to ring true. Whereas 
Tay seemed to repeat phrases 
and attitudes she was given, 
SimSensei is more in-tune with 
her functional purpose. But 
does doing her job well make 
her intelligent, however?  Since 
she is so devoted to her particu-
lar purpose, there doesn’t seem 
much room for 
any learning 
on her part; 
it’s like giving 
a human 
a script 
and tell-
ing them 
to interact 
and build re-
lationships with 
random people 
using only those 
words. Perhaps 
this purpose is the 
most important aspect 
of AI. Creating an arti?cial 
intelligence for a speci?c 
purpose allows researchers 
to streamline its functional 
capacity and to better con-
struct the robot with skills 
and attributes which serve 
that purpose. While it 
might be necessary to im-
bue an AI with some form 
of a subconscious, a full-
on consciousness seems 
more future than present. 
The possibilities are growing, 
and conversational AI charac-
ters are becoming increasingly 
lifelike. The question is, what 
other lovely disasters will pave 
the way to this end-goal?
electromagnetic spectrum. 
This spectrum refers to the 
spectrum of all possible 
types of radiation. Radia-
tion is the emission of en-
ergy in the form of waves 
or particles, and comes in 
forms ranging from from ra-
dio waves, to visible light, to 
gamma rays. 
Radiation is de?ned by its 
frequency and wavelength, 
and the frequency deter-
mines how much energy 
the radiation has. For the 
strength of a magnet typical-
ly used in an MRI machine 
— 1.5 to 3.0 tesla — the 
corresponding energy gap 
produced in atoms exposed 
to the ?eld is equal to that 
of radiation in the frequency 
range of radio waves. 
In order to measure the 
energy gap produced by the 
magnet in the MRI machine, 
the machine projects radio 
waves onto the patient to 
excite the magnetized atom 
and cause it to essentially 
jump the energy gap. 
When the atom falls back 
down from the excited state 
of the energy gap, it emits 
the energy it absorbed as ra-
diation in the form of radio 
waves. 
It is this re-radiation that 
the MRI machine detects us-
ing antennas placed close to 
the patient’s body. 
Another interesting prop-
erty of an MRI machine is 
that the magnetic ?eld pro-
duced is not constant, but 
rather a gradient. If the ?eld 
were constant, the spin mag-
netic moments produced 
in the atoms of the patient 
would all be the same, and 
there would be no differ-
entiation between different 
parts of the body.  
In order to produce a 
gradient magnetic ?eld, 
coils are placed throughout 
the machine with different 
properties to create vary-
ing magnetic ?elds along 
the length of the machine. 
The gradient magnetic ?eld 
produces gradient spin mag-
netic moments along the pa-
tient’s body, which creates 
a gradient of re-radiation 
radio wave signals picked up 
by the MRI. 
Knowing what part of 
the machine corresponds 
to what part of the mag-
netic ?eld allows computer 
programs to generate an 
image from the re-radiation 
signals.

physical copy is still in the ?le 
cabinet, you know it hasn’t 
been stolen and that you still 
have access. However, in the 
digital world, a virus could 
infect the system and lurk 
for months before becoming 
active, without anyone ever 
noticing.
One suggestion was to 
use “an old Russian spy 
system,” where the data re-
quires two keys to access, 
with two different people 
carrying the keys. This might 
make it harder for the data to 
be hacked into, but it would 
also be a hassle for a nurse 
or doctor who just wants to 
quickly look up a patient’s in-
formation. Another idea was 
to keep physical hard copies 
as backups for all the data 
stored online, which would 
make ransomware less 
threatening, as there would 
always be a way to access the 
information even if the digi-
tal copies were malignantly 
encrypted. One Pugwash 
speaker drew an analogy be-
tween these computer virus-
es and real-life biology, com-
paring the evolution of cyber 
attacks and defenses to the 
arms race of biological muta-
tions seen between predator 
and prey. Ransomware and 
other viruses are constantly 
evolving, so large systems 
like hospitals or governments 
need to keep on their toes to 
be able to ?ght back. This is 
another frightening aspect of 
ransomware — if an organi-
zation pays up to keep their 
data, then that money just 
goes to fund the criminals 
and allows them to create 
even more malicious code. 
Even with the best cyber de-
fenses, one Pugwash mem-
ber said, the real issue is so-
cial engineering. Taking data 
from the network and keep-
ing it in a closed system, or 
requiring two keys to access 
it doesn’t work if people don’t 
know how to use the system. 
There are bene?ts to having 
health data connected in a 
large network — applying 
“big data” techniques to huge 
databases of (anonymized) 
medical data could lead to 
big advances in treatment, 
and being able to send in-
formation across institutions 
connected by the network 
makes it easier for patients to 
receive treatment, wherever 
they are.  But do the bene?ts 
outweigh the risks?

Threshold voter laws foster participation, democracy
The 2016 presidential election, 
set for Nov. 8, will see many young 
individuals voting for the ?rst time 
in a presidential election, but not 
all of these individuals will have 
had the opportunity to vote in their 
state’s primary or caucus. In many 
states, including Pennsylvania, age 
restrictions require citizens to be 
18 years old to vote in their party’s 
corresponding primary or caucus, 
meaning that 17-year-old citizens 
are unable to vote in their primary 
or caucus, even if they will be 18 be-
fore the general election.
Laws have already been passed 
in many states that allow 17-year-
olds to vote in their respective pri-
mary or caucus provided they will 
turn 18 before the general election. 
17-year-olds can vote in primaries 
and caucuses in the District of Co-
lumbia and over 20 states, although 
several of these states are only open 
to 17-year-old Democrats.
Threshold voter laws have be-
come a controversial topic, and 
many argue that if someone is able 
to vote in the general election, they 
should have some say in their par-
ty’s nominee. 
Threshold voter laws in Penn-
sylvania’s neighboring state of 
Ohio have been under scrutiny this 
year after Ohio Secretary of State 
Jon Husted announced in Decem-
ber that threshold voters would no 
longer be allowed to participate in 
the Ohio primary. Husted has since 
been overruled, and the courts 
ruled on March 11 that threshold 
voters could continue to participate 
in the primaries.
The issue of threshold voters 
has also been raised in Pennsyl-
vania, namely in a 2007 proposed 
bill sponsored by then State Rep. 
Richard Grucela (D–Northamp-
ton). State Rep. Robert Freeman 
(D–Northampton) also supported 
the bill, noting that it would encour-
age young voters to get involved and 
stay involved. “If we engage them 
now, there’s a greater likelihood 
they’ll stay involved for the rest of 
their lives,” Freeman said. While 
the proposed bill was supported by 
many, some argued that the focus 
should be on more important issues 
such as voter fraud. Despite the sup-
port of a variety of potential thresh-
old voters, some of whom testi?ed 
during a House State Government 
Committee hearing, the bill did not 
pass.
Currently, Pennsylvania still re-
quires all voters to be 18, although 
there is some speculation that this 
could change. Wanda Murren, press 
secretary for the Pennsylvania De-
partment of State, acknowledged 
that the Department of State is look-
ing into threshold voter laws. “The 
department is currently reviewing 
how other states are handling this,” 
Murren said, although she noted 
that even if changes were made, 
they would not affect this year’s 
primary.
Although threshold voters will 
not be able to participate in this 
year’s primaries, The Tartan hopes 
that the recent focus on thresh-
old voting laws in Pennsylvania 
will persist and that laws allowing 
threshold voters to participate in 
primaries in Pennsylvania will be 
enacted.
It is important to promote par-
ticipation among young voters in 
general elections, but it is unfair t 
ask ?rst-time voters to support can-
didates that they didn’t have a hand 
in choosing. If we want threshold 
voters to participate in the general 
election, it is important that they be 
allowed to in?uence the candidate 
their party nominates. 
These voters are more likely 
to participate in the general elec-
tion if they feel that their voice has 
been heard in the primary, and cul-
tivating an engaged, voting youth 
is vital to a maintaining a vibrant 
democracy. 
Allowing threshold voters to par-
ticipate in their states’ primaries 
and caucuses will also promote a 
sense of participation and will allow 
all ?rst-time voters to have a stake in 
the candidate their respective party 
nominates. 
Fostering this sense of involve-
ment in young voters is important, 
as it produces youth that are politi-
cally aware. It has been shown that 
once a person votes they are more 
likely to vote again, so ensuring 
the participation of young voters is 
critical.
The Pennsylvania primaries are 
right around the corner, so this is-
sue is in urgent need of attention. 
The Tartan hopes that Pennsylva-
nia, along with other states who 
require all voters to be 18 years of 
age, will realize the importance of 
youth participation in politics and 
allow threshold voters to participate 
in primaries and caucuses.

The past week has been a rough 
time to be a member of the Carnegie 
Mellon community. We suddenly 
lost not one, but two of our peers. 
Rajat Patra and Elliott Glasgow 
were both far too young to be taken 
away from us. 
Even as we reel from the shock 
and mourn their loss, we must re-
member Rajat and Elliott not for 
their early deaths, but for the in-
credible people they were during 
happier times. 
At The Tartan, we want to play 
our part and address the issues 
with the respect that they deserve. 
As a result, we’re making a change 
to this week’s paper that we’d like 
to explain.
We are postponing our Natrat 
edition. Natrat is our once-a-year, 
April Fool’s day themed edition that 
we typically publish during the ?rst 
week of April, which includes fake 
satirical news similar to The Onion. 
In light of the past week, fake 
news that pokes fun at Carnegie 
Mellon’s idiosyncrasies would not 
be appropriate at this time.
Instead, we have decided to 
dedicate the front page of the pa-
per to the memorial service for both 
Elliott and Rajat. They deserve to 
have their story told, and we want 
to do everything we can to achieve 
that end. 
It is with this reasoning that we 
felt this was the most appropriate 
course of action given the circum-
stances.
We also want to urge people to 
take a moment to re?ect on Elliott 
and Rajat and the lives they lived. 
The discussions these deaths have 
sparked on campus are well-mean-
ing and important, but it is also im-
portant to ensure that the lives of 
the people igniting these conversa-
tions are not pushed aside.
As Carnegie Mellon’s newspa-
per, we want to make sure we treat 
this tragedy with the deference de-
served by the campus community 
and both Elliott and Rajat.
A message from The Tartan Board regarding Natrat
Whole Women’s Health seeks right to abortions
ARIEL HOFFMAIER
Staffwriter
At the beginning of March, the 
Supreme Court heard its ?rst abor-
tion case in nine years. The fate of 
women’s reproductive freedom in 
America rests on the decision in 
Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. 
Keep a careful eye on this one, guys, 
because it will either revive Roe v. 
Wade, or deal it a ?nal death blow. 
Many aren’t aware of, ?rst, the 
incredible blessing that Roe was 
for American women, and, second, 
how far Roe has fallen since it legal-
ized abortion in 1973. Roe was a 
Supreme Court decision before its 
time and perhaps, in spirit at least, 
before ours. Prior to Roe, abortion 
care was denied to women in al-
most every state and under all cir-
cumstances apart from risk to the 
mother’s life. 
Far from ancient or even com-
mon law, anti-abortion laws were 
an invention of the Victorian era, 
enacted super?cially to protect 
women’s health but in reality to 
control their bodies. 
Abortions continued to occur de-
spite ubiquitous restrictions, but for 
the most part they were desperate, 
dangerous, back-alley ordeals that 
put women at grave physical and 
psychological risk. 
The “Second Wave” feminist 
movement in the 1960s through 70s 
demanded an end to such restric-
tions on a woman’s right to choose 
the timing and circumstances of her 
entry into motherhood. In 1973, 
when a handful of blue states were 
just beginning to liberalize their 
anti-abortion laws in response to 
feminist pressure, Roe shocked the 
nation. 
Freedom to choose an abortion, 
with certain limitations, was now 
the law of the land. Roe legalized 
abortion not absolutely, but on a 
sliding scale. According to the deci-
sion, the woman’s interests in the 
?rst trimester far outweigh any in-
terests of the fetus, and the abortion 
procedure at this stage is so safe 
— safer than childbirth, in fact — 
that the state has no reason to inter-
fere. Abortion in the ?rst trimester 
should be considered “inherently, 
and primarily, a medical decision,” 
the private business of a woman 
and her physician. 
After the second trimester, the 
safety of the woman may be increas-
ingly balanced with the safety of 
the fetus. Abortion may be banned 
only in the third trimester, when 
the greatly increased safety risks of 
the procedure and viability of the 
fetus — its “capability of meaning-
ful life outside the mother’s womb” 
— become “compelling” enough 
for the government to override the 
woman’s choice. Considering that 
over  90 percent of abortions occur 
in the ?rst term, the Roe decision 
granted most women the absolute 
legal right to an abortion. For a brief 
shining moment, the highest court 
in the land respected women’s right 
to choose and granted them unprec-
edented — if not total — control 
over their own bodies. 
Unfortunately, abortion oppo-
nents have worked diligently in the 
decades since 1973 to disempower 
Roe. The oft-forgotten Hyde Amend-
ment has severely limited abortion 
access, particularly for low-income 
women. 
Successfully defended before 
the Supreme Court in 1980, this 
amendment to Roe cut off all fed-
eral government funding for abor-
tions, including any abortion cover-
age through military or government 
job insurance as well as Medicaid 
— except in cases of rape, incest, or 
endangerment of the mother’s life. 
32 states follow the Hyde 
Amendment to the letter, with six 
extending funds in the case of fe-
tal impairment or grave impact on 
the mother’s health, while 17 states 
may partially or even wholly miti-
gate the costs for “medically neces-
sary” abortions. 
The main result of the Hyde 
Amendment is that underprivileged 
women on Medicaid, who consti-
tute about 16 percent of the adult 
female American population, have 
been forced for the last 36 years to 
pay for abortions out of pocket. 
These costs are high, averaging 
$500 in the ?rst trimester, and apart 
from the abortion procedure itself 
women often must pay several hun-
dred dollars in transportation and 
childcare costs as well as lost wages. 
The total expense of the abortion 
“experience” might demand a third 
or more of a low-income woman’s 
monthly salary. 
The Hyde Amendment, working 
together with women’s concerns 
that their insurance will not provide 
coverage or protect their con?den-
tiality, has greatly contributed to a 
post-Roe society where almost 70 
percent of insured women across 
the socioeconomic spectrum cannot 
or do not use their insurance to pay 
for abortion care. This statistic may 
only get worse. 
Last January, Congress voted for 
the eighth time in a year to defund 
Planned Parenthood, and despite 
GOP representatives’ failure to 
override President Obama’s veto, 11 
states have taken it upon themselves 
to cut funds for the non-pro?t.  
Anti-choice Republicans in state 
and national congresses, bolstered 
by a well-funded lobbying machine, 
have been willfully forgetting the 
Hyde Amendment’s existence in 
order to disguise their true aims. 
It has been all too easy for Repub-
licans with Hyde-shaped holes in 
their memories to argue that cut-
ting off federal funds to Planned 
Parenthood would only mean a nod 
to the sensitivities of anti-choice 
taxpayers. 
However, the Hyde Amendment 
ensured decades ago that no fed-
eral taxpayer would have to pay for 
abortion care, and Planned Parent-
hood uses federal funds not for its 
abortion practice but exclusively for 
contraception, STI testing, and can-
cer screenings.
The ultimate goal of the GOP’s 
attack is not only Planned Parent-
hood’s head on a platter — IUDs, 
pap smears, and all — but nothing 
less than total elimination of insur-
ance coverage for abortion. 
Ironically, President Obama’s 
Affordable Care Act has made this 
mission easier by providing federal 
support for private insurance com-
panies. Since the federal govern-
ment now has more power to regu-
late these ostensibly independent 
companies, it becomes feasible that 
anti-choice Republicans could in-
centivize private companies to drop 
abortion coverage. 
For all women, but especially 
poor women, this is a frightening 
prospect indeed, as lack of coverage

$15 wage steps in right direction, falls short of liveable
CALEB GLICKMAN
Junior Staffwriter
This week, California State Legis-
lature proposed and approved a bill 
raising the state minimum wage to 
$15. This is the ?rst state to approve a 
minimum wage of $15. The only pre-
vious minimum wage hikes that high 
were in major cities, like Seattle, San 
Francisco, and Los Angeles.
Now, as someone raised in L.A., I 
may seem a bit biased. I have grown 
up in an area with one of the high-
est costs-of-living in the country. 
Instituting the long-term minimum 
wage hike last year in Los Angeles 
to $15 seemed like a no-brainer. But 
what people need to realize is that 
$15 should not be the stopping point. 
Especially for single parents with 
one child, the livable wage is much 
higher. For example, according to the 
Living Wage Calculator developed by 
MIT professor Amy Glasmeier, it aver-
ages out to about $25.26 per hour for 
the entire state of California.
You may say to yourself, ‘but that’s 
California! Those West Coast people 
have such a bizarre lifestyle, of course 
it’s more expensive.’ But that very 
same statistic put up against all 50 
states puts the lowest livable wage for 
single parents in Kentucky, at $18.50 
— $3.50 above the highest minimum 
wage in the country.
On Thursday, Governor Andrew 
Cuomo of New York also announced 
another deal to raise the minimum 
wage to $15 statewide. With the two 
of the most populous states in the 
country making this change, it is only 
a matter of time before the rest of the 
country follows suit.
The main argument against 
raising the wage is that it will cost 
employment. The argument goes that 
raising wages will force business to 
lose money and cut jobs. It seems rea-
sonable, except that there is very little 
evidence to support it. Sure, if you 
raised the minimum wage to $1,000/
hour, no one could pay it, and the 
concept of a job would lose meaning 
overnight. Still, this isn’t the case. The 
extreme example doesn’t set the re-
cord straight. Rather, these raises are 
only a few dollars. There hasn’t been 
enough clear testing to know if these 
incremental raises affect employ-
ment. But considering the long term, 
the minimum wage has been raised 
22 times since 1938. In this time, the 
national GDP per capita has gone up 
even when the minimum wage was 
raised. There isn’t a complete consen-
sus on the issue, but many economists 
agree that the effect on employment 
is negligible overall.
In the end, if the minimum wage is 
above the livable wage for single peo-
ple, effects will start to ripple through 
the economy. People will spend their 
money. Going back to Henry Ford’s 
concept that his workers should be 
able to afford his cars, people with 
higher wages tend to put back into 
the economy. This will strengthen the 
middle class and help create a more 
stable environment of economic 
growth. Hopefully more people will 
realize th
at California’s change is one step 
in ensuring that wealth gets to those 
at the bottom, and not just at the top. 
This is a step that the entire nation 
should be taking.Jarel Grant/Staff Writer
With a six-year cushion, it is 
tempting to look back on the Reces-
sion of 2008 as an old injury, one 
that is healing well as unemploy-
ment rates drop, the housing market 
improves, and private-sector jobs 
expand. All these improvements 
are due in large part to the 2009 
American Recovery and Reinvest-
ment Act. That progress is undeni-
ably promising, but there are parts 
of the economy that have remained 
largely untouched by the recovery 
— such as the in?nitely ballooning 
price of college education.
Tuition at Carnegie Mellon has 
increased nearly $10,000 since 
2010 , and while the university 
cites projects such as The Sherman 
and Joyce Bowie Scott Hall and the 
University Center expansion as key 
factors, there are other mechanisms 
at work. The Roosevelt Institute 
at CMU, a student-run branch of 
the New York City based Roosevelt 
Institute has found that Carnegie 
Mellon has lost over $39 million in 
interest rate swap deals since 2004. 
To put that ?gure into perspective, 
that’s enough to pay for the tuition 
of almost 200 students for four 
years of undergraduate at Carnegie.
Interest rate swaps are ?ttingly 
named. A swap deal occurs when 
a ?rm takes out a loan or bond and 
chooses to swap the variable rate 
on its interest payments for a ?xed 
rate. For example; Carnegie Mel-
lon took out a $100 million loan 
in 2006 for help funding construc-
tion and refunding its previous 
debts. The university chose to pay 
a ?xed monthly interest rate of 3.4 
percent rather than paying a vari-
able rate that would ?uctuate with 
the market. This was before the re-
cession, when banks were telling 
investors that interest rates were 
going to increase. So swapping no 
doubt seemed like a good way to 
save money.
Unfortunately the crash hap-
pened, and interest rates fell. Be-
cause of the swap agreement, CMU 
was locked into its ?xed rate and 
ended up paying a much higher 
monthly interest rate than the mar-
ket rate, which collapsed alongside 
the rest of the economy. A move 
that was initially intended to save 
the university money has ended up 
costing $24 million — and the deal 
doesn’t end until 2028.
This arrangement worked out 
nicely for the university’s coun-
terparty, PNC Financial Services. 
Though the 2008 recession took 
many by surprise, there are those 
who think some bankers knew it 
was going to happen, and saw po-
tential pro?t in swap deals. Regard-
less of whether or not they were 
aware that it was coming, banks 
were the ones responsible for the 
2008 crash. The swap deals that 
many universities have undertaken 
at this time proved to be bad deals 
across the board, and universally 
bene?cial for the banks. It begs the 
question: should bankers be more 
transparent regarding their beliefs 
about the future?
The answer is obvious. Financial 
institutions are legally obligated to 
relate pertinent information to their 
clients in order to avoid this very 
issue, and should be held account-
able when they make pro?ts off of 
the money we pay our university. 
We ask this of our institution: make 
better decisions so as to keep that 
money where it belongs. 
And of its ?nancial partners: re-
spect the integrity and fairness of 
partnership so that we may secure 
a viable ?nancial future for our 
university.

Mental health needs personalized problem solving, not buzz words 
GOWRI SUNDER
Junior Staffwriter
There has been a lot of discussion 
about stress culture, mental health, 
and social support at CMU, and it is 
clear that people aren’t really sure 
what the best way to move forward 
is. Not even considering the issue of 
limited funding for mental health, 
there are so many factors in what 
it takes to create a mentally healthy 
environment and it would require a 
lot to move the discussion outside of 
hashtags and ?gure out how we can 
do better. 
This is simply because mental 
health is a complicated topic, there 
are so many factors that could ben-
e?t from intervention. Arguably no 
mental health debate has gotten 
more attention that the question of 
trigger warnings. Restructuring this 
discussion to focus on the ways we 
can provide additional support on 
campus and with the media we con-
sume will allow us to create a more 
accessible and safe environment for 
individuals with mental illnesses.
Despite the fact that the conver-
sation about trigger warnings and 
mental health has successfully left 
the utopia of social media blogging 
platforms and entered discussion 
on college campuses, the discussion 
has become so polarizing that it is 
no longer moving in a productive 
way. 
Without a solid understanding 
of what people that are suffering 
from trauma, anxiety, depression, 
and the huge range of disorders 
that are vulnerable to triggers actu-
ally need from their environment, 
the conversation has turned into a 
question of censorship, what people 
?nd uncomfortable, and a one size 
?ts all accommodation for mental 
illnesses.
A look into the history of trigger 
warnings does not tell us much. The 
thing about the word “trigger” and 
the de?nition we now associate with 
it is that, well, it’s not clear where it 
comes from. Looking at academic 
papers in psychiatric and clinical 
journals, the term trigger doesn’t 
hold the same speci?c meaning; it is 
largely just used as verb to describe 
a cause-and-effect of a disorder. 
Papers in The American Journal of 
Psychiatry use the word trigger to 
describe what causes a disorder, 
such as a study on whether physi-
cal illness triggers body dysmorphic 
disorders. 
It appears to have ?rst emerged 
through feminist journals and so-
cial media to describe a common 
experience of mental illness, and it 
garnered enough popular opinion 
to stick around. With the support of 
extremely liberal students, vaguely 
therapeutic speech has worked its 
way into our culture as a clinical 
buzzword.
Changing mental health care 
based on experiential accounts 
rather than research is not new, or 
really the main issue behind trigger 
warnings. Therapy and psychiatry 
rely on the development of lan-
guage to break down problematic 
neural associations that underlie 
a number of mental disorders and 
help their patients bring symptoms 
under control. 
So, naturally, there is a parallel 
development in language growth 
of the therapeutic and pop cultural. 
In fact, Post Traumatic Stress Dis-
order (PTSD) was ?rst included in 
the third Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of mental disorders (DSM-
III) as a result of veterans returning 
home from Vietnam, and this diag-
nosis initially faced a lot of skepti-
cism and controversy. What a trig-
ger means colloquially is a stimuli 
that sets off destructive symptoms 
of a disorder, usually relating to 
trauma, phobias, or self harm. 
Any sort of label or diagnosis or 
buzzword serves the function of 
simply communicating a speci?c 
idea in a way that allows us to ex-
plain our experiences more speci?-
cally. The lack of language to talk 
about illness is a challenge for most 
people dealing with mental health 
problems. I would be hesitant, 
therefore, to dismiss both the sig-
ni?cance of the term as well as its 
origins.
One of the other arguments 
against the implementation of trig-
ger warnings is the idea that the 
real world does not come with trig-
ger warnings, so we should not be 
teaching students to avoid their 
problems. 
This is a statement that needs to 
be unpacked and, to some extent, 
debunked. It is clear that the im-
mediate need to dismiss the idea of 
trigger warnings is directed at its 
origins. Those involved in feminist, 
racial, and queer discourse are more 
likely to promote the use of trigger 
warnings, and the need to lump 
triggers in with political correctness 
and censorship is frankly callous. It 
is not “coddling” or unreasonable 
to expect a college environment to 
prevent students from reaching a 
state of psychological distress that

often means complete inability to 
purchase abortion care. 
In 1992, Planned Parenthood v. 
Casey fundamentally reversed Roe’s 
ban on state interference in ?rst-
trimester abortions and opened the 
?oodgates for severe and often ab-
surd restrictions on access. 
The case brought the Pennsylva-
nia Abortion Control Act of 1982 be-
fore the Supreme Court in the midst 
of a nationwide swing back toward 
the right. 
An anti-abortion law obviously in 
violation of Roe, the Abortion Con-
trol Act featured ?rst-trimester ob-
stacles to abortion  such as a 24-hour 
waiting period, parental consent for 
minors, and a mandatory “informed 
consent” counseling session that 
included false information about 
the supposed detrimental effects of 
abortion. 
The Casey decision, in direct op-
position to Roe, proclaimed that 
these obstacles were legal so long 
as they did not pose an “undue bur-
den” to a woman trying to access an 
abortion. Since Casey, the number 
of state TRAP laws — or “Targeted 
Regulation of Abortion Providers” 
— has skyrocketed.  
In addition to the regulations 
earlier mentioned, certain TRAP 
laws require abortion clinics to con-
form to surgical requirements for 
no medically valid reason, essen-
tially forcing them to either spend a 
fortune to rebuild or to shut down. 
Faced with a mine?eld of entirely 
legal TRAP laws, it is unsurpris-
ing, if not disheartening, that the 
number of abortion clinics in the 
United States has declined steadily 
and signi?cantly since 1983.  More 
regulations mean fewer clinics can 
survive, and fewer clinics mean that 
fewer women can access abortion 
care without traveling long distances 
and facing the consequent costs. The 
“undue burden” change to Roe is the 
perfect loophole to regulate abor-
tion rights to death.  This “undue 
burden” clause will be addressed in 
Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. 
The case challenges Texas’s 2013 
HB-2, a TRAP law that requires all 
abortion clinics to spend many mil-
lions on wholly unnecessary outpa-
tient surgical facilities and admitting 
privileges at local hospitals. HB-2 
has forced almost half of the state’s 
abortion clinics to close in just a few 
years; the second largest U.S. state 
now has only 19 clinics serving its 
huge territory, practically insuring 
most women will have to drive hun-
dreds of miles for medical care. Even 
these are far from safe from further 
restrictions. 
Hellerstedt will determine once 
and for all whether such laws 
constitute an “undue burden” on 
women’s access to abortion. The 
recent death of conservative Su-
preme Court justice Antonin Scalia 
has substantially changed the out-
look for the case and may be a ten-
tative beam of hope for pro-choice 
advocates. Now, there is a ?rm pos-
sibility that the Court will split 4–4 
instead of upholding the Texas TRAP 
laws wholesale. But this would only 
delay the death blow I mentioned 
earlier, leaving women just as vul-
nerable to increasingly ubiquitous 
state restrictions.
In the decades since Roe granted 
American women the right to an 
abortion, the “undue burden” clause 
and the Hyde Amendment have left 
reproductive freedom dead in the 
water. Our old friend Roe is a con-
servative ruling or two away from 
null. Right without access is no right 
at all, and legalized abortion won’t 
matter if no clinics can afford to stay 
open and no woman can afford to 
abort. 
If there is no obstacle too great 
between a woman and an abor-
tion, then abortion might as well be 
illegal. 
Women’s battle to claim control 
over their bodies is far from over. 
Their enemies are patient and orga-
nized, with deep pockets: a multi-
headed hydra of zealous Christians, 
right-wing fundamentalists, and un-
abashed misogynists. 
Keep an eye on Hellerstedt, and 
don’t doubt the power of the states 
to cut into women’s access to abor-
tion. Most importantly of all, keep 
?ghting. Because without the right 
to control your own body, you have 
nothing.

they pose a danger to themselves or 
their well-being.
On the other hand, the response 
to such accusations ends up in such 
a state of defensiveness that there 
is not enough attention given to the 
practical issues of implementation.  
The prevalent idea behind trigger 
warnings is a starting point, not a 
?nal solution to changing the envi-
ronment on college campuses to fos-
ter better mental health. For either 
side, it would be valuable to look 
into clinical strategies and the etiol-
ogy of the myriad of mental illnesses 
that trigger warnings are intended 
to help.
Exposure therapy is used mainly 
to treat phobias, and this is what the 
classic arguments against trigger 
warnings seem to be drawing from. 
The idea behind exposure is that to 
deal with the triggering stimuli, you 
have to face it and learn to cope with 
the negative reaction. Over time, 
the association formed will become 
weaker and the stimuli stops being 
triggering.  
As much as learning to cope with 
immense psychological and physi-
ological reactions is the foundation 
of most treatments, it is not simply 
advise to just deal with being upset. 
Patients learn to face their triggers 
in a clinical, safe environment us-
ing a combination of skills from talk 
therapy, progressive muscle relax-
ation, mindfulness, distress toler-
ance, and the wide range of speci?c 
treatment plans to an individual’s 
disorder and mental state. 
Trigger warnings intend to give 
power back to an individual to take 
control of their own recovery and 
what they are capable of dealing 
with on a day to day basis.
That is the idea behind it, any-
way. But it is also where the pro-
posed solution falls short. On social 
media, designing your own utopian 
space is the point. 
But the reality is that colleges do 
not have the resources to accommo-
date everyone’s trigger in the form of 
a trigger warning, and therapists do 
not generally support the strategy of 
avoiding triggers in real life.
The reason for this is that any-
thing can be a trigger. Yet not label-
ing everything with a trigger warn-
ing implies a hierarchy of legitimacy 
in disorders, and that is counter pro-
ductive.  
And it is not realistic to expect 
trigger-warning labels for literally 
everything, for obvious reasons. 
Sexual assault and suicide trigger 
warnings are thoughtful, but they 
do not consider the fact that triggers 
are generally random associations 
— a location, an object, a name, a 
sound — with a traumatic event or 
the ?ght-or-?ight response. Further-
more, not everyone knows what will 
be triggering.
So it is more helpful to have a 
plan to help if something trigger-
ing comes up rather than struggling 
to keep classes and media trigger 
free. The second part of a clinical 
exposure is learning to apply dis-
tress tolerance and coping skills. 
Developing a safety plan is a part 
of trauma treatment, and there are 
modi?cations that can be designed 
for a wide variety of disorders. This 
is great because it gives an individu-
al skills to try to cope with a trigger, 
which means that facing the world is 
a more achievable task.
A campus-wide safety plan, 
therefore, would appear to be the 
best solution for the exposure to a 
trigger. Giving students the ability 
to opt out of a lecture is important, 
but the follow up care is by far more 
important. Leaving class because 
of triggering subject matter can in-
crease the stress of the situation, 
putting the spotlight on the student 
without actually starting a conver-
sation . In some ways it is another 
way of letting our campus commu-
nity not take responsibility for our 
collective mental health. 
If a student is triggered in class, 
given a warning or not, what sup-
port structures do we have in place 
to help them? This is about day-to-
day challenges, so there should be 
an easily accessible professional to 
turn to or a space to work through a 
safety plan. 
CaPS and the Mindfulness Room 
are both good ?rst steps to providing 
that support, but they are both dif?-
cult spaces to enter. There are small 
changes, like having counsellors that 
can be reached immediately rather 
than the two week appointment or 
comfortable lounges where students 
can decompress, working with skills 
they have learnt in therapy. 
Moving towards these kind of 
questions, trying out different solu-
tions and working through problems 
in existing systems, is a better 
discussion to be having because it al-
lows to account for the complexity of 
mental health. 
Mental health care is not a one 
and done deal, it requires the com-
munity and professionals to work 
together to provide support.
Abortion case puts anti-choice undue burdens on watch

There was a bomb blast on March 
22 in Brussels. 32 people were in-
jured in the blast. 
Immediately, almost all west-
ern media reacted to this, and was 
shocked by these suicide bombs led 
by ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and 
Syria).
On March 20, that same week, 
there was an alleged suicide bomb-
ing led by ISIS in Istanbul, Turkey. 36 
injured. There was another one on 
March 13, in Ankara, with a deadly 
car bomb that exploded. In Lahore, 
there was another bomb blast this 
week, where 75 people were killed 
and over 340 injured by the Taliban.
Yet most Facebook posts I saw 
and most news articles popularized 
by the Western media described 
the tragedy in Brussels. When they 
were both equally tragic tragedies, 
only one was cared for. Where was 
the discussion on Turkey? Lahore? 
Where were the condolences to-
wards those who face this more 
regularly than in Western countries? 
Where was the extensive media 
coverage?
Where was my pro?le picture 
?lter with the Turkish Flag?
Our world values some tragedies 
over others. This very similar situ-
ation occurred with the attacks in 
Paris last year. 
The attacks non-western coun-
tries face from terrorist groups are 
often much larger than the ones 
western countries face. This may be 
a once a year occurrence in Brus-
sels, but it’s a nearly monthly battle 
in Turkey, Pakistan, Palestine, Iraq, 
Syria, and Afghanistan. 
This speaks to an imperialis-
tic mindset that exists within our 
society — non-western countries, 
bodies, and people do not matter as 
much. The value of humanity that 
we hold today is inherently placed 
upon those who have the power to 
?ght this, not those who don’t.
Part of this is Islamophobia, and 
the attacks by the Islamic militant 
groups certainly don’t help. Do peo-
ple know that ISIS is a larger threat 
to Muslims than to non-Muslims? 
Do people know that average Mus-
lim people are targeted by both mili-
tants and backlash from the west? 
Our media is dominated by what we 
see and who controls it.
The fact is that tragedies like 
these are daily in some places. But 
this isn’t often enough for the west-
ern media to report it or to care. 
My heart goes out to the victims 
of Paris and Brussels, but also to the 
victims of the Lahore, Istanbul, and 
Ankara attacks. 
We can’t say some lives matter 
more than others, or let distance 
from a tragedy obscure the human-
ity. 
So let’s change the discourse, edu-
cate ourselves, and look at where our 
news is coming from. Because, quite 
frankly, #JeSuisSickOfThisShit.

Tartan track and ?eld teams dominate Quad Meet at home
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon track 
and ?eld teams hosted their 
annual Carnegie Mellon Quad 
Meet on Saturday. Both teams 
triumphed over the ?eld, 
which included teams from 
Westminster College, Penn 
State Behrend, and Saint Vin-
cent College.
The women’s track and 
?eld team earned 216 points 
and won seven events. Sopho-
more thrower Kiersten Chuc 
and ?rst-year thrower Oly 
Nwankwo each threw the 
hammer with Chuc winning 
the event with a mark of 41.63 
meters and Nwankwo ?nish-
ing second with a mark of 
40.28 meters. Nwankwo also 
?nished second in the shot put 
with a mark of 11.12 meters, 
while Chuc was second in the 
discus throw with a career-
best mark of 33.24 meters. 
First-year thrower Alexa Bar-
riero ?nished second in the 
women’s javelin throw with a 
mark of 30.34 meters.
Senior mid-distance run-
ner Taylor Maggiacomo ran 
to a career-best time in the 
3,000-meter steeplechase as 
she ?nished it in 11:57.58, 
shaving more than 14 seconds 
off her previous best. Senior 
distance runner Haley Bry-
ant won the 1,500-meter run 
with a season-best time of 
5:07.24. First-year sprinter, 
mid-distance runner, and hur-
dler Rose Ciriello picked up a 
victory in the 800-meter run 
with a time of 2:23.10. First-
year sprinter and jumper De-
barati Bhanja placed second 
in the long jump with a mark 
of 4.82 meters, and ?rst-year 
jumper and sprinter Autumn 
Hair came in third with a mark 
of 4.70 meters. Junior hurdler 
and jumper Sommer Farber 
?nished second in the 100-me-
ter hurdles in 17.09 with ju-
nior hurdler and jumper Re-
becca Fortner ?nishing third 
in 17.13. 
Sophomore sprinter Sarah 
Cook also picked up a second-
place ?nish when she crossed 
the ?nish line in a season-best 
59.23 in the 400-meter run. 
Bhanja ran to a career-best 
time when she ?nished third in 
the 400 in 59.64 seconds. Ju-
nior sprinter and jumper Jeri-
lyn James ran the 100-meter 
dash in 13.46 to place second 
while Hair was third in 13.51. 
James later ran the 200-meter 
dash in 28.47 to place second. 
In the high jump, Fortner won 
with a meet-record height 
of 1.55 meters. First-year 
jumper Tessa Allen cleared 
1.55 meters to place second 
while junior sprinter, jumper, 
and thrower Emily Swanson 
jumped over the bar at 1.50 
meters for a career best.
Senior mid-distance run-
ner Liz Snyder won the 
3,000-meter run in 10:40.58 
with senior distance runner 
Natalie Smith placing second 
in 10:59.86. Senior distance 
runner Kira Ragazzo made it 
a sweep with a third-place ?n-
ish in 11:08.32. The women 
closed out the meet with a vic-
tory in the 4x400-meter relay 
when Bhanja, James, Ciriello 
and Cook crossed in 4:09.65.
The men’s track and ?eld 
team scored 205 points, just 
over Penn State Behrend’s 
198 points. First-year sprinter 
and jumper Rai Walters won 
the long jump with a mark 
of 6.79 meters against a -1.2 
wind reading. In the triple 
jump, sophomore jumper 
Eloy Fernandez ?nished third 
with a jump of 12.65 meters. 
Sophomore thrower Jacob 
Schofel placed ?rst in the 
hammer throw with a mark 
of 51.04 meters while sopho-
more thrower David Trzcinski 
was third with a mark of 41.22 
meters. 
The discus saw the Tartans 
?nish with second- and third-
place points, as Schofel was 
second with a mark of 37.94 
meters and ?rst-year thrower 
Kenny Sladick was third with 
a throw of 36.04 meters. 
First-year jumper Reed Farber 
and sophomore sprinter and 
jumper Cameron Smith each 
cleared 1.81 meters to tie their 
respective career best and 
tied for third place in the high 
jump.
Junior mid-distance run-
ner Curtis Watro won the 
3,000-meter steeplechase with 
a time of 9:50.45 while junior 
mid-distance runner Owen 
Norley won the 1,500-meter 
run in 4:04.89. Junior hurdler 
and jumper Don Boyer earned 
a win in the 400-meter hur-
dles in 58.45 seconds. Senior 
sprinter Jeff Chen was second 
in the 400-meter run in 51.27 
to tie his career-best while he 
was third in the 200-meter 
dash in 23.50. 
Senior mid-distance run-
ner Marc-Daniel Julien also 
picked up a second-place ?nish 
when he crossed the ?nish line 
in 1:55.88 in the 800-meter 
run. Graduate distance run-
ner Josh Antonson led the 
Tartans in the 3,000-meter 
run, placing ?rst in 8:58.39. 
Junior mid-distance runner 
Gordon Pace was behind An-
tonson in second place with a 
time of 9:09.25. The 4x400-
meter relay saw the team of 
?rst-year sprinter Kyle Lee, 
Julien, ?rst-year mid-distance 
runner Isaac Mills, and Norley 
win in 3:25.44, less than three 
seconds ahead of the second 
place team.
Both Tartan teams will 
next compete at the John Ho-
mon Invitational hosted by the 
University of Mount Union on 
Saturday, April 9.

Tartan tennis continues to  easily sweep enemies away

Sports Editor
This weekend, thousands 
of people gathered in an are-
na in Columbus, Ohio to ex-
perience the ?rst ever Coun-
ter-Strike: Global Offensive 
(CS:GO) major championship 
held in North America. CS:GO 
is an objective-based multi-
player ?rst-person shooter 
game. Teams of ?ve players 
form Terrorist and Counter-
Terrorist teams, and attempt 
to either complete an objec-
tive or eliminate the enemy 
team. For the Terrorist team, 
the objective is to plant a 
bomb at a designated bomb-
site and then detonate it. For 
the Counter-Terrorist team, 
their objective is to defend the 
bombsite at all costs. Teams 
play in multiple areas, called 
“maps.” Games in profession-
al play are decided by the best 
of three different maps, and 
the teams play a best of 30 on 
each map. The game is fast-
paced and fun to watch, and 
the fans are dedicated.
The reason this particular 
championship in Columbus is 
so signi?cant is because it is 
the ?rst of its kind to be held in 
North America. Major CS:GO 
Championships are tradition-
ally held in Europe, where the 
following for the game is the 
largest. But the North Ameri-
can fans have long waited 
for a major event to come to 
the continent to quench their 
thirst for competition, and 
this year they got their wish. 
16 teams quali?ed for the 
competition, which features a 
prize pool of $1 million. The 
highest prize pool for any ma-
jor event before this has only 
been $250,000. North Ameri-
can teams have also tradition-
ally never done well at these 
major events. This event actu-
ally marks the ?rst time that a 
North American CS:GO team 
even made it out of the group 
stages at a major internation-
al event, as Team Liquid made 
it all the way to the semi?-
nals before falling to Brazil-
ian powerhouse Luminos-
ity Gaming. This was much 
more than anyone expected 
from a North American team, 
especially because of how 
well Liquid played against 
Luminosity in their semi?nal 
match. Everyone had expect-
ed Luminosity to easily sweep 
their opponents, but the 
home team managed to hold 
it together for longer than 
anyone thought they could, 
and played a well-fought set 
that they can be proud of.
Luminosity had anoth-
er, much bigger challenger 
ahead of them however: the 
titan that is Natus Vincere 
(Na’Vi). Na’Vi is the ?rst team 
in CounterStrike history to 
win three major tournaments 
in one year (2010), and have 
been a top contender since 
their inception. This team was 
expected to coast their way 
through the tournament until 
the ?nals, and they did. After 
sweeping both Ninjas in Py-
jamas and Team Astralis 2–0 
in quarter?nals and semi?-
nals respectively, Na’Vi surely 
went into the ?nals with an 
air of con?dence about them.
And in the ?nals, the 
famed European squad Na’Vi 
and the aggressive Brazil-
ian team Luminosity Gam-
ing clashed in an explosive 
display of mechanical skill 
and strategic prowess. Na’Vi 
opened the ?rst map with six 
unanswered round wins, and 
Luminosity looked ?ustered. 
The European squad seemed 
to too fast and too smart for 
the Brazilians to win, but Lu-
minosity quickly ?gured out 
a strategy and answered with 
three straight round wins of 
their own. They fought back 
and showed Na’Vi that they 
should be taken seriously, but 
the ?rst map went into half-
time with Na’Vi having a com-
fortable lead.
Luminosity opened the 
second half with a vengeance, 
scoring 6 unanswered points 
of their own and nearly tying 
the game. Na’Vi was on the 
back foot, and they looked a 
bit confused as to how they 
were losing. Luminosity’s 
unique and unpredictable 
strategies caught Na’Vi off 
guard and gave them an op-
portunity to get back into the 
game. Na’Vi is a seasoned 
team however, and did not 
give up. 
The ?rst map went into 
the sixth and ?nal round of 
overtime where Luminosity 
ultimately emerged victori-
ous, an unexpected result to 
say the least. Everyone ex-
pected the second map to be 
another close game, but Lu-
minosity had other plans. The 
Brazilians took the second 
map by storm and completely 
dominated the tournament 
favorites. Na’Vi took the ?rst 
round, but could only manage 
one more after that. Lumi-
nosity took the victory 16–2, 
along with the $500,00 dollar 
prize for ?rst place. 
While a North American 
team didn’t manage to bring 
home a victory on home turf, 
everyone loves to see the un-
derdogs win. This event was 
surely one for the books, and 
the community can’t wait to 
see what these teams have in 
store for the next competition.

6–0, 6–1. Alla showed up with 
his own straight set victory to 
seal the win for the Tartans, 
winning 6–3, 6–2.
On Saturday, the Tartan 
men’s tennis team took on 
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty on the Tartans’ home court. 
The Tartans defeated the Gen-
erals in a convincing 8–1 vic-
tory. The Tartans swept dou-
bles play, starting with an 8–4 
win in ?rst doubles from the 
duo of Arora and Levine. The 
pair of Chen and Zheng took 
second doubles 8–2, while 
Kumar and Alla took third 
doubles by the same score.
The Tartans continued 
their domination of the Gen-
erals in singles play. Kumar 
was the ?rst to ?nish a singles 
match, winning 6–1, 6–0 in 
sixth singles. Zheng took with 
singles with a score of 6–2, 
6–1 and Alla won in the ?rst 
position, 6–1, 6–0.
The 11th-ranked Carnegie 
Mellon women’s tennis team 
also hosted to the Washington 
College Shoremen on Friday. 
The Tartans swept their oppo-
nents in a convincing 9–0 vic-
tory to improve to 13–5 on the 
season in dual matches.
The Tartans set the pace 
quickly in doubles play. The 
duo of senior Abbey Hams-
tra and junior Nicholle Tor-
res took third doubles 8–1 to 
score the ?rst point for the 
Tartans. Senior Brooke Tsu 
and ?rst-year Jamie Vizelman 
won second doubles with a 
score of 8–4, and the pair of 
sophomore Cori Sidell and 
?rst-year Minami Makino 
won 8–3 in ?rst doubles.
Singles play was much of 
the same for the Tartans. Tor-
res won second singles 7–5, 
6–1 to put the Tartans up 4–0. 
Sidell won in the third posi-
tion with a score of 2–6, 7–5, 
10–2. Vizelman took fourth 
singles 6–4, 6–2. Makino and 
?rst-year Marina Selenica 
each won straight set victories 
in ?fth and sixth singles, re-
spectively. Both players won 
6–0, 6–0.
The Tartan women will be 
back on the court at 3 p.m. on

Easter is over. The chocolate bunnies have been eaten. 
The Cadbury eggs are surely gone; the only evidence 
that they ever existed is the wrappers all over your 
bedroom ?oor. There’s a void in your heart and a 
rumble in your tummy. Your sweet tooth cries out for 
more.
I feel this loss most poignantly for my little friends 
— the Marshmallow Peeps. Digging my teeth into 
the sweet ?uff, I would think ‘God, there is truly no 
substitute for this bliss.’ And I was right. There is 
no substitute. There is, however, a better way, and a 
better shape.
The more time I spend in the kitchen, the more I’m 
convinced that homemade is better. There is the 
obvious comfort you get from knowing every single 
ingredient in your food. But more importantly, fresh 
marshmallow isn’t crunchy or stale. It’s pure ?uff. 
And if you’ve already done all of the work to make 
homemade marshmallow, why make a pastel bird? 
It’s been done. It’s not very original. You can make 
whatever you feel like!
Me? I felt like shit.
For the sugar coating
1 cup of sugar
Red, green, and blue food coloring
1 tablespoon of cocoa powder
For the marshmallows
1/3 cup of water
1 packet of gelatin
1/4 cup of water
1 cup of sugar
1 teaspoon of vanilla
There are a few of things you’ll need to make these, 
in decreasing order of importance: an electric mixer, a 
piping bag and round tip, and a candy thermometer. 
You can de?nitely survive without the thermometer 
(I did!), and you can always use a baggy to pipe in a 
pinch, but I don’t know of anyone with the upper body 
strength to whip on high speed for 10 minutes. If you 
don’t have a mixer, send this to your mom and say 
please.
The marshmallow comes together really fast, so before 
we get ahead of ourselves, we have to make the 
brown-colored sugar that transforms the pretty white 
cloud swirls into delightful dung piles.
Pour one cup of sugar and one tablespoon of cocoa 
powder into a zip-lock bag with food coloring. If you 
have brown, use that. But from a standard four pack 
of food coloring, an equal mixture of red, green, and 
blue should result in a perfect shade of poop. Squeeze 
out all the air, seal the bag tightly, and give it a shake. 
It’ll be wet, so lay it out evenly on a baking sheet lined 
with foil to dry while you do the hard work.
Now in your mixing bowl, ?rst pour in the water, and 
then sprinkle the gelatin over top. Let that sit for 10 
minutes, which should be all the time you need to 
make the sugar syrup.
Mix up one cup of sugar and a quarter cup of water 
together in a small pot over medium-low heat. This 
step is much easier if you have a candy thermometer. 
Just turn the heat off when it hits 235 degrees 
Fahrenheit. But if not, do it the old-fashioned way. 235 
is also called the soft-ball stage. When all the sugar 
has dissolved and the syrup is bubbling but still clear, 
drop a small bit into a bowl of cold water. When the 
syrup is done, it should form a ball in the water but 
?atten in your hand. It should take about 10 minutes, 
so conveniently, as long as the gelatin and water need 
to gel.
Now break up the gel with a spoon and pour in vanilla 
with the syrup. Turn the mixer speed up to seven at 
?rst until it starts to thicken and the splash factor goes 
down, but then turn it up the whole way. After 10 
minutes, what began as a lumpy goop will transform 
into marshmallow — a pure, airy treasure.
Spoon the marshmallow into a piping bag with a round 
tip and start swirling little poops piles on top of the 
layer of poop-brown sugar. (If you piped directly onto a 
tray they would never come unstuck.) To pipe like an 
expert, remember three keys: 1. Squeeze at the very 
top with your dominant hand and guide with the other, 
2. Keep the pressure consistent, 3. Keep the tip directly 
above where you want it to go.
Also, if the piles ?atten, then the marshmallow might 
still be too hot. So wait a minute or two and try again.
Before the poops dry out, coat them with the sugar to 
complete the cloud to poop transformation. Rolling is 
the most effective way to coat them completely, but 
sprinkle some over top ?rst so your ?ngers don’t stick.
I brought these to Easter brunch, and a brilliant 
nine-year-old put it best: “They’re like poop, but way 
better!”

4gallery review
pillbox 04.04.16
Iranian artist and Carnegie Mellon master’s of 
?ne art student Nima Dehghani’s thesis, titled 
“Decompensation,” is currently on display in the Miller 
Gallery, where it recreates ?ve psychological stages that 
refugees experience as they settle into an alien socio-
cultural context in the form of a multimedia installation 
involving projection, sound design, and virtual reality.
The piece is participatory in nature. A large screen 
with a projector serves as the theatrical backdrop to ?ve 
stools. On each stool sits an Oculus Rift (virtual reality 
simulator) and a pair of headphones. On the screen, 
above each stool is written the stage it corresponds to: 
Early Arrival, Destabilization, Exploration, Return to 
Normal Life, and Decompensation. People are invited to 
sit and experience an immersive representation of each 
psychological stage through the Oculus and headphones, 
while simultaneously becoming performers for the rest 
of the gallery. “Decompensation” was a collaboration 
between Dehghani, Soosan Lolavar, a master’s student in 
the School of Music’s Advanced Music Studies certi?cate 
program in music composition, and Laura Stokes, a 
dancer and choreographer from the greater Pittsburgh 
area. 
The piece is representative of Dehghani’s long-term 
interest in new technology and media as well as theatre, 
and their use as more than just a means of entertainment. 
They can also serve as a platform for social debate.
KM: Could you tell us a bit about your career as an 
artist before coming to Carnegie Mellon?
ND: I came to Carnegie Mellon in 2013. Before that, I 
was in Iran. I studied architecture and worked as an 
architect and a designer for ?ve years. Besides that, I 
was involved in theatre. I was writing plays and I later 
became a director when a festival invited me to perform 
one of my plays and there were no directors who could do 
what I wanted. For that play, I won a prize for directing 
and two weeks later, I won another for playwriting, which 
was around the Iranian equivalent of two thousand 
dollars. I was twenty at the time and it was too much. I 
thought that maybe I can make money out of art, instead 
of architecture. I was always interested in combining art 
and technology in all of my performances. After around 
four years of working in the professional theatre world 
of Iran, I decided that I needed to improve myself. There 
was nothing else to get here, so I decided to apply to art 
schools. I chose the MFA program because it’s a very 
open program so you can do whatever you want to do. I 
was the kind of person who was always jumping from one 
?eld to another, so I really needed a program that helped 
me to combine all of them.
KM: In your future career, are you planning on 
returning to your roots in theater, or continuing to 
do gallery and installation pieces?
ND: I’m not sure what will happen after graduation, but I 
really don’t like gallery work. I don’t like to make a piece 
for a gallery and just leave it there. The work needs to 
be alive. I would say that I’m more interested in public 
and social practices rather than visual art in galleries, 
whether it is through urban installations or public 
performances. It needs to somehow be engaged with 
people.
KM: The fact that art seems to be getting further 
and further removed from non-artists is a common 
criticism these days. Why do you think this is the 
case?
ND: That’s totally true! This isn’t just a problem with art 
here. I had this problem back home. The problem is that 
artists are making art for the other artists, and in the best 
scenario, they make art for the critics, not for the public. 
There is a ?ne line between making art for the public 
and making art for entertainment. Both of them are okay, 
but I really don’t want to make art just for entertainment. 
I want to make effective art for the public, not just for 
artists. I really believe in making art as simple as you can 
for the audience. Making complicated art is much easier 
than making art that is simple and understandable.
Nima Dehghani’s work, along with the work of all the 
other graduating MFA students, is on display in the 
Miller Gallery as part of the  second major exhibit of the 
year, titled Self Driving Car. The exhibit is scheduled to 
stay until April 10. Dehghani’s piece is open to the public 
Tuesday to Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.

cabaret
pillbox 04.04.165
On Wednesday, March 30, the CMU Soundbytes staged 
a performance in The Underground. The restaurant 
has such a quaint little cafe quality, with its dim lights, 
comfy sofas, and its intensely sugared coffee. The little 
stage in the front of the room was covered with cords, 
chords, and the talented members of this enjoyably 
upbeat a cappella group. It was a smaller, more intimate 
performance than you’d typically expect, with fewer 
group numbers and more duet/solo songs.
This week had been dif?cult for many reasons, so it 
was nice to experience such a comfortable, warm space 
?lled with music. The cabaret began with a word from 
Soundbytes vice president and sophomore science and 
humanities scholar, Christina Cabana, who quoted Karl 
Paulnack, Director of the Music Division of the Library 
of Congress, who said “Someday at 8 p.m. someone 
is going to walk into your concert hall and bring you 
a mind that is confused, a heart that is overwhelmed, 
a soul that is weary. Whether they go out whole again 
will depend partly on how well you do your craft.” This 
quote has always stuck with me personally, but in 
the context of this week, there were a lot of us in The 
Underground who needed to be put back together. 
Music is certainly a lovely glue.
There were several highlights from the night, but the 
?rst one to come to mind was sophomore physics major, 
Paul Rogozenski, who sang Johnny Mathis’s “Misty.” 
Cabana introduced him by saying that when he chose 
the song, “all of the panties in the room dropped,” 
and as the investigative journalist I am, I paid close 
attention to see if it would happen again. I’ll be darned 
if the second he opened his mouth to sing, there wasn’t 
the noticeably soft “whoosh” of undergarments hitting 
hardwood. His voice was so melty and delicious and 
transcendent, and it was a real joy to listen to. He 
could have just guzzled an entire bottle of honey, and 
rather than sing, just open his mouth and let it ooze out 
sensually, and it would have achieved the same effect 
as his performance.
Halfway through the performance, the group took a 
20-minute break to create an impromptu arrangement 
of the audience-requested song, Sir Mix-a-Lot’s “Baby 
Got Back.” After twenty minutes, they reconvened on 
the stage to prove that baby did in fact have back. It was 
only a fraction of the group, with Cabana as the soloist, 
two harmonizing voices, and three percussion boxers, 
and this group size worked out really well. It was a nice, 
light performance that left the audience both happy 
and at peace with the world and all of the bodacious 
badonkadonks which inhabit it.
Cabana also sang Fleetwood Mac’s “Landslide,” 
accompanied by junior chemical engineering major 
Johnathan Roppo, on the guitar. In contrast with some 
of the other performances, this one melded seamlessly. 
Roppo and Cabana’s voices were very well suited to each 
other, and particularly for this song. Cabana’s ?rst song, 
Adele’s “Can’t Let Go,” utilized a higher register than 
“Landslide,” and during the entire Adele performance, 
I was wishing that Cabana had settled into her lower 
register more. “Landslide” granted that wish, and it 
was so pleasant. My notes for this performance were 
“omg her voice is gorgeous, and wow their harmony is 
fantastic, I’m actually peeing, yes.”
Perhaps my favorite Soundbytes soloist, freshman art 
major Toby Donoghue, with Adele’s “Remedy.” Cabana 
introduced Donoghue by saying that “we always do fun 
facts at auditions because we have to weed out all the 
weird people mirthful laughter. Her fun fact was that she 
is half mermaid, but it should have also been that she is 
half Adele.” Donoghue has such a casual way of singing 
that doesn’t match the transcendent angel chorus that is 
her voice. She makes it seem so easy, but I’m sure that if 
half of the audience tried to sing in the same way, we’d 
sound like tortured goat people rather than an angel 
chorus. In my notes, I have recorded that when she sang 
the line “When the pain cuts you deep,” my reaction was 
“omg I’m crying what is this life.”
Overall, it was a lovely night. There were a few lyrical 
slip-ups, where one of the soloists sang something to the 
tune of “words words, there are more words here,” and 
another just kinda mumbled a bit until he got it back, 
but these just added to the cute, casual atmosphere. The 
audience was there to enjoy, not to judge or to rebuke; 
it was a lovely night full of music and good feelings and 
delicious, melty, panty-dropping voices.

What is the point of music? Is it simply meant to be easy 
on the ears, a refuge from the sonic wasteland we have 
built for ourselves, a purely intellectual pursuit, with 
composers exploring and experimenting with new sound 
palettes, or is there something else? A human element? 
On the night of Saturday, April 2, the Warhol Sound Series 
at the Andy Warhol Museum featured a performance by 
world renowned contemporary music group Ensemble 
Linea. The entire time they were playing, I couldn’t help 
but wonder to myself, what is the point of music?
Founded in 1998 in Strasbourg, France, by the conductor 
and pianist Jean-Philippe Wurtz, Ensemble Linea has 
performed worldwide in important festivals and has 
collaborated with famous composers such as Ivo Malec 
and Brian Ferneyhough. The ensemble consists of a violin, 
viola, cello, ?ute, clarinet, trombone, and piano, though 
not all pieces call for the entire ensemble.
Ensemble Linea’s setlist Saturday night featured some of 
the most prominent contemporary composers, almost all 
graduates of the Institut de Recherche et Coordination 
Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM) in Paris. A general theme 
seemed to be the extensive use of extended techniques 
(any method of producing non-sound from an instrument) 
to test the limits of acoustic sound production on 
traditional instruments. This could mean anything from 
bowing on the wrong side of the bridge on a violin, to 
whispering into a ?ute along with all the possibilities in 
between: hitting, rubbing, and scraping. The aim is to 
turn an instrument into an abstract generator of sound, 
rather than a construction based on certain social norms, 
such as the western scales or tuning system.
The ?rst piece on the program, a piece by Raphael 
Cendo titled “Rokh I,” was a three-movement exploration 
of the cyclical process of life, death, and resurrection. 
Rokh, related to the Greek Phoenix, is the giant avian 
guardian of the tree of knowledge in One Thousand 
and One Nights. The movements echo the life cycle 
of the piece’s namesake through alternating moments 
of stasis and intensity, with the climax reaching a 
fever pitch. The piece re?ected Cendo’s technique of 
“sound saturation,” in which he explores the limits of 
instrumental capabilities, especially speed. What resulted 
was a cornucopia of timbre almost entirely consisting of 
extended technique.
A particularly useful extended technique is the prepared 
piano, or an acoustic piano that has been ‘prepared’ by 
inserting objects like bolts, screws, springs, or metal rods 
in, on, or between the strings. What results is a completely 
customizable instrument. This was used to particular 
effect in most of the pieces on the program, in particular 
“Rokh I,” in which the climax is augmented by the 
thunderous bass register of the prepared piano.
Unfortunately, “Rokh I” suffered from a common de?ciency 
observed of most contemporary music. Its excessive focus 
on sonic experimentation would leave any person not 
familiar with this style dissatis?ed and possibly alienated. 
However, behind its outer shell lies a musical core that 
expresses the duality of tension and release, expectation, 
and ful?llment, something that most people can relate to.
Most of the other pieces on the program were somewhat 
less effective. “Constructa,” by Italian composer Valerio 
Sannicandro, and “Iconica” by Marco Momi both used 
similar amounts of extended technique, though neither 
achieved the same nerve wracking intensity as “Rokh 
I.” Except for the stunning piano postlude in “Iconica,” 
neither were particularly memorable. I wish I could say 
the same about “Indeed,” a solo trombone performance 
by Pascal Dusapin. What started out as a pleasant enough 
solo for an underrated instrument quickly devolved into 
a microtonal mess with an increasingly out of breath 
trombonist puf?ng away to the progressive vexation of our 
bombarded eardrums.
By far the best pieces on the program were “Fiocchi di 
Silenzio” by Aurelien Dumont and “Études en Alternance 
1, 2, 3” by Frederic Durieux. While both were clearly 
grounded in the idioms of contemporary classical music, 
they avoided the normal excesses of the genre is normally 
by retaining familiar stylistic features such as repeated 
rhythms and motifs. This made them more accessible. 
The études in particular were breathtaking, using the 
perfect combination of traditional timbres with sonic 
experimentation to create a truly moving experience.
This brings us back to our question: what is the point 
of music? Is it just an exploration of sound — a cold, 
impartial look at the possibilities of the pressure 
differentials that our brain can interpret? If so, then why 
did so many of the pieces leave me dissatis?ed, as if 
there was something left to say? Why were the études, 
ostensibly the least experimental or innovative pieces, 
the most moving? Maybe there is something more to 
music, something deeply tied to our social and cultural 
unconscious: a web of references, implications, memories 
that surrounds every sound we produce, and rather than 
attempting to divorce music from this web, sterilizing it 
of all social context, why not revel in its uncanny ability 
to speak to people at a more fundamental level than the 
purely intellectual? Why not restore a point to music?

Zayn Malik’s Mind of Mine: On the morning of 
March 25, I rolled over in a haze to turn off my alarm, and 
then proceeded to check email, Twitter, Facebook, texts, 
and Timehop. And on my Timehop, I was confronted 
with harsh ?ashbacks of ZAYN’s announcement that 
he would leave One Direction. On March 25, 2015, I 
tweeted “NO ZAYN YOU DON’T MEAN IT COME BACK 
PLZ STAY I LOVE YOU.” And one year later, on March 
25, 2016, ZAYN released Mind of Mine.
As heartbroken as I was and continue to be over the 
dissolution of my favorite boy band since *NSYNC, I 
have to concede that I can’t stop listening and dancing 
to Mind of Mine. ZAYN completely reinvented himself, 
a far cry from the catchy tween tunes from his 1D days. 
We now know what’s going on in that mind of his. And 
it’s sex.  ZAYN is all grown up, whether or not his fans 
are.
When I watched the “Pillowtalk” music video for the 
?rst time, I nearly fell over. If it hadn’t been for the 
psychedelic video editing, it would have been softcore 
pornography. I shudder to think about the 14-year-old 
girls who are getting down to this, and their mothers 
who must feel horri?ed. 
I’ve lived through this so many times. Britney Spears 
from “...Baby One More Time” to “If U Seek Amy.” Miley 
Cyrus from “The Best of Both Worlds” to “We Can’t 
Stop.” Nick Jonas from “Lovebug” to “Chains.” The 
music industry turns generations of young artists into 
sex symbols, but markets them to tweens and young 
teens. I’m generally the same age as the 1D members, 
but when I went to their concert in Philadelphia a couple 
years ago, I found more 13-year-olds than 20-year-olds.
When these artists inevitably grow up to explore their 
creativity and sexuality, as they should, these children 
are yanked along for the ride. I have no problem 
singing loudly in the car with ZAYN about “fucking and 
?ghting,” but I do have a problem imagining middle and 
high schoolers trying to relate.

Gramatik’s Epigram: Last week, Brooklyn-based 
producer Gramatik released Epigram, his long-awaited 
follow–up to 2014’s The Age of Reason that continues to 
push his ever-evolving sound. The album covers a wide 
range of styles over its ten tracks, from driving techno to 
orchestras sampled from Game of Thrones, but it remains 
grounded in Gramatik’s hip-hop roots, so it sounds 
focused in its experimentation. Featuring appearances 
that range from the Wu-Tang rapper Raekwon to the 
throwback soul-singer Leo Napier, Epigram is a testament 
to Gramatik’s constant efforts to freshen his sound and 
remain a creative outsider in the electronic music scene.
Epigram builds off of Gramatik’s change in direction 
following his last two releases, 2012’s #digitalfreedom and 
2014’s The Age of Reason. Merging his heavy use of horn 
and soul samples over hip-hop beats with thicker synths 
and an aggressive edge, the two releases were a major 
departure from the softer sounds of his previous albums 
and heralded a new Gramatik capable of all-out bass 
assaults.
Epigram sees Gramatik play with the deep bass 
and pistol-cocking samples of trap on “War of the 
Currents”and create the kind of driving techno dance 
rhythms that could keep a warehouse going until 8 
a.m. on tracks like “Corporate Demons” or his remix of 
Laibach’s “Ear Liver!” These tracks are interesting at ?rst 
glance, but are ultimately repetitive and lack the soul that 
causes a song to stick with the listener.
While the album’s experimental edge indicates that 
Gramatik isn’t relying on tried-and-true frameworks, his 
master skills are in hip-hop production. Epigram’s soaring 
moments are when the soul is given center-stage. “Satoshi 
Nakamoto” comes roaring after the “Tempus Illusio” 
intro and features verses from rappers Adrian Lau and 
ProbCause. 
References to cryptocurrency and magic mushrooms are 
?red over a bumping bass beat accented by screaming 
horn samples, ending with the kind of blistering blues 
guitar work that’s become a staple of Gramatik’s recent 
work. “Native Son”, which features verses from Raekwon 
and vocals from Orlando Napier, tells a story of struggle and 
survival in the urban ghetto tinged with regret and loss. It’s 
a downtempo number with jazzy guitar licks and soulful 
singing from Napier and serves as the album’s centerpiece. 
“Native Son” is immediately followed by the swinging soul 
number “Native Son (Prequel),” with Napier bringing a bat-
out-of-hell energy and proclaiming that he’ll “go straight to 
hell laughing” over jazz guitar and a rocking beat. “Prequel” 
stands as my personal favorite on the album, and its catchy 
hook will be stuck in your head for days guaranteed.
The Slovenian-born Gramatik is as interesting a personality 
as you can ?nd in the electronic music scene. He’s a 
fanatic of all things Nikola Tesla (“War of the Currents” and 
“Room 3327” are both song titles that are direct references 
to the inventor) and a vocal supporter of the free exchange 
of information and ideas. He doesn’t charge a cent for his 
music and releases all of it for free through partnerships 
with BitTorrent on his website. Hopefully future producers 
develop the same kind of openness that Gramatik and 
his contemporaries have and we won’t all have to buy a 
subscription service to listen to music.
Epigram is available for free download on gramatik.net and 
on streaming platforms such as Spotify and SoundCloud.

[ Apeksha Atal  |  Staffwriter ]
By night one way, by day another.
Pittsburgh is one of those cities that’s evolving from 
what it was in its heyday. The steel mills and iconic 
musty air are transforming into a modern urban hub, 
with a mix of an old-time and rustic-chic aesthetic.
The issue that seems to exist at the moment is that 
this city appears to fall asleep a little too early for the 
average college student to appreciate. It’s often looked 
down at because it’s compared to cities like New York, 
Boston, and Chicago, when in reality, we’re a whole 
different type of city. But I would almost say that it is 
the sleepiness that currently lingers about our city that 
makes it accessible and beautiful.
Our weather is unpredictable, our neighborhoods 
are eclectic and distinct, and in and around Oakland 
we’ve got a lovely college-town atmosphere that has 
settled in. On a lovely sunny day we bask in the sun on 
picnic blankets, sipping bubble tea and scar?ng down 
waf?es and hotdogs in Schenley. In the rain we huddle 
around warm bowls of ramen in establishments up and 
down Murray and Forbes. In the winter we keep warm 
with hot drinks from the likes of both big names like 
Starbucks and local cafes, and in the spring we warily 
continue drinking the same beverages lest the winter 
snow makes a comeback. 
At night, we often ?nd ourselves con?ned to our rooms 
?nishing up assignments, or catching up on movies 
and TV alone or with friends. We order in pizza, wings, 
Indian food, and all sorts of guilty pleasures and take 
solace in the meaningful late night conversations we 
have with those wandering around dorms late at night. 
While some of the most memorable moments of my 
life at Carnegie Mellon have been created through 
such experiences, I’ve been lucky enough to be 
pushed out of my comfort zone this past semester 
by writing for this paper. I took writing about food to 
be a fun, easy task, until I realized that I only had so 
many restaurants that I knew well enough to casually 
sit down in and experience. Now, I actively seek out 
new dining opportunities, and consequently have 
been able to have a taste — not just of the food — but 
of the raw and transforming culture that Pittsburgh 
has to offer. So, when a friend offered to accompany 
me for a night on the town photo session and dining 
extravaganza, there was no way I could have refused.
9:00 p.m.
Our night began at Station Square, which is built 
around the late 19th century Pittsburgh & Lake Erie 
Railroad (P&LE). When we told our Uber driver where 
we were going, he immediately asked us “which bar?” 
— and appropriately so. The area is now known for its 
many restaurants and bars, as well as its quirky mom-
and-pop shops housed inside of the Freight House, 
which sell everything from toys to cigars.
The Freight House’s facade is something right out of 
what I would imagine a classic entrance for a circus 
to look like. Bright lights and tastefully painted bold 
letters accompany a sign that proclaims the old train 
shed’s lifespan. “1897–1979” made this building hard 
to resist entering. Because we arrived a little later 
than anticipated, most of the stores were closed 
and in the unexpected emptiness, we were free to 
explore the charming corridors that lead us around 
the structure. The closed shops gave off a heavily 
nostalgic air of the past, which was further brought 
to life with a small arcade nestled away in a corner of 
the House. Gumball machines and brick walls, jewelry 
stores and buzzing incandescent bulbs came together 
to yield a surreal sense of the past colliding with the 
present. 
9:45 p.m.
With my camera ?lling up every extra second we 
spent in the Freight House, we began a short, but 
scenic stroll over to the Monongahela Incline at Mount 
Washington. I would like to note here, that admission 
to both the Monongahela Incline and the Duquesne 
Incline are free with your Carnegie Mellon ID and 
both lines run until 12:30 a.m. It’s a great place for 
some good conversation and contemplation, and once 
you reach the top you’ll get one of the best views in 
Pittsburgh.
It was from this dramatic height, perched on a 
concrete platform, that I looked out at the yellow-lit 
Steel City and the clustered buildings and majestic 
rivers that make it up. The waters of the Monongahela 
River re?ected the lights from the towering buildings 
with a long, distorted rendering, and sparkled under 
the illuminations from the Smith?eld St. Bridge. 
We were joined by some visiting families who eagerly 
looked out over the city and breathed heavy sighs of 
satisfaction. The view stretches quite far, and includes 
the Carnegie Science Center, Point State Park, Heinz 
Field, Station Square, and much more. To the left 
was the hauntingly radiant St. Mary of the Mount 
Church, brightly lit up with an intense yellow glow. 
An adjacent large American ?ag waved in the wind, 
contributing to the echoes of history that had been 
following us over the past hour as we encountered 
structure after structure that had been a part of 
Pittsburgh just a little longer than our own university.

---------------------------------------------------

10:10 p.m.
We would have stayed at the incline longer, but the 
restaurant we were planning to visit closed at 11 
p.m., and we were getting hungry. Mount Washington 
boasts a pretty wide variety of restaurants, most within 
walking distance of each other, as well as some ice 
cream parlors and candy shops that are open during 
the day time. 
By night, the area changes from a more family friendly 
scene to one of laid-back nightlife, with restaurants 
and bars welcoming both their regulars and curious 
visitors.
Shiloh Grill is just a couple minutes’ walk from the 
top of the Monongahela Incline, and from a good 
distance looks like an over-decorated wooden deck. 
Rest assured, the restaurant has both indoor and 
outdoor seating, the latter of which is an ode to the 
aforementioned rustic-chic atmosphere that I’m 
beginning to pin on Pittsburgh. 
From the ?ery sign to the simple, yet comfortable deck 
furniture that occupied to outdoor seating portion, 
Shiloh Grill really was something else. The railings 
of the deck were lined with more incandescent light 
bulbs and the waiters were lively and more than happy 
to help me with my indecisiveness. 
All-in-all, it was a fun night, and it has given me the 
urge to go back and see what other interesting places 
there are nearby. 
Pittsburgh is blossoming everywhere, and I urge you 
to get out there and take it by storm. Our campus is 
lovely, but at times it can be a little self-contained, and 
taking a step out is a breath of fresh air that I’ve found 
to be both ful?lling and refreshing. 
Now, in the spirit of my regular column, here’s a quick 
rundown of what we tried over at The Shiloh Grill:
Spa day: 
By the waiter’s recommendation, I ordered this 
mocktail to mellow out the intense ?avors of the 
food to come. Flavored with lemon and cucumber, 
this drink was delightfully light and incredibly 
refreshing. I appreciated that it wasn’t as sweet 
as your run-of-the-mill virgin mojito, but still had a 
cool quality, brought in more by cucumber slices than 
mint leaves.
Macaronis Et Fromage De Langoustine: 
LOBSTER MACARONI AND CHEESE!? Yes, and it 
was as glorious as it sounds. The cheese was gooey 
and rich, the macaroni was cooked just right, and an 
absolutely stunning crunchy baked crust topped the 
dish. The lobster ?avor was also a perfect complement 
to the sharpness of the cheese. It was wholesome and 
hearty, and had me reaching back for more long after I 
was full.
Cookies-N-Cream: 
A skillet-baked cookie topped with whipped and ice 
cream. It was warm and cold, soft and chewy all at 
once. Truly a great conclusion to the evening.
Cha-ching: 
Cards and cash are both welcome.
Meat, glorious meat: 
A pretty good spread of options, although the food falls 
more on the meaty side.
Are we there yet?: 
Right across the street from the Upper Monongahela 
Incline Station. I’d recommend taking an Uber. 
Address: 123 Shiloh St., Pittsburgh, PA 15211.

Sun 10 a.m.–12 a.m. (kitchen open until 11 p.m.)
21+: 
The place is very famous for their quirky and 
innovative cocktails. They’ve also got a pretty solid 
wine and beer collection.
Ambience: 
Like I said before, rustic chic. This is a great place 
for dinner, and the atmosphere is incredibly, for lack 
of a better word, chill. The waiters were very friendly, 
the food was delicious, and the weather was nice 
(although I can’t promise that for any given night). 
College student friendly?: 
I didn’t see a lot of other college students around, but 
they’re de?nitely used to a young crowd and I didn’t 
feel out of place in any respect.

Now that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice has 
burst into theaters, attention has turned to the future 
of the DC Cinematic Universe. One consistent remark 
about the film is the strength of Ben Affleck’s portrayal 
of Batman as a rugged, beaten down, seasoned 
vigilante who uses his past to fuel his anger. Most 
notable is a short scene depicting Bruce Wayne staring 
at the vandalized costume of his fallen partner, Robin. 
Director Zack Snyder commented to IGN on why he felt 
it necessary to include such a visual:
“In my mind, it was that Robin had died 10 years 
earlier, during some run in with a young Joker 
... In a weird way, he sacrificed everything to be 
Batman, right? He doesn’t really have a life outside 
of the cave. I thought by including a dead Robin it 
would help us understand he’s been on quite a little 
journey.”
Snyder’s comments reinforce his commitment to give 
Affleck’s Batman the strongest possible motivation to 
be as brutal as he is. His comments also reinforce the 
mission of Batman v Superman to setup the films to 
follow.
On August 5, Suicide Squad comes to theaters and 
viewers will be introduced to Jared Leto as The Joker. 
Leto is an Academy Award-winning actor (Dallas 
Buyers Club) who chooses his roles very deliberately. 
He has spoken before about his approach to his 
characters and his effort to give moviegoers a different 
experience with each one. In an interview with 
Entertainment Weekly, Leto expanded on his approach 
to differentiate his Joker from the others who came 
before:
“You just knew you had to do something different. 
You had to make it your own. That happens all the 
time. Whether you’re a composer working on a piece 
of music that was written a century ago, or you’re 
an actor on stage, reinterpreting a play, it’s very 
common these days. Directors take on great works 
of cinema, actors reinterpret roles, that’s been going 
on for a great deal of time. From Scarface to Hamlet. 
In some ways it’s really interesting to reinterpret, 
redefine. It’s a weighty thing to do. But it’s exciting. 
The Joker is one of those roles.”
It becomes obvious Leto is the purest form of an artist. 
He injects himself into his work and refuses to ignore 
past artists who have done the same. The first reveal of 
Leto as the Clown Prince of Crime was met with plenty 
of harsh criticism, but I anticipate his acting prowess 
to bring a fresh menacing Joker to the screen.

Concussion tells the story of Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights to get his research on chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain damage suffered by professional football players recognized. When 
Mike Webster, a former Pittsburgh Steeler, is found dead in his truck, Omalu handles the autopsy. On 
examining Wesbter, he finds evidence of brain damage as a result of repeated blows to the head. When he 
publishes a paper describing his findings, the establishment, led by the NFL, largely dismisses it. Over time, 
Omalu discovers other cases of deceased NFL players having severe brain damage with similar symptoms 
as Webster. As he struggles to have his voice heard, the NFL is gradually compelled to consider his case.

The Spring Flower Show at Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens is a wonderful way to 
destress at the end of a busy week. This years’ theme, “Masterpieces in Bloom,” showcases 
botanical interpretations of the works of artists such as Van Gogh and Monet. Van Gogh’s “Starry 
Night” is reconstructed with swirls of delphiniums, forget-me-nots, and primula. Beds ?lled 
with hundreds of red, orange, yellow, and white tulips are used to render Monet’s “Tulip Field in 
Holland.” These, and other botanical artworks, together make for an otherworldly experience.
