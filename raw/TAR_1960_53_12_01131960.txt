Board Of Trustees At Tech 
Now Separate From Institute
For the first time in her sixty year history, Carnegie is 
functioning with a Board of Trustees separate and apart 
from that of Carnegie Institute.
When Andrew Carnegie founded the university bearing 
his name, it was as a fifth de-f 
partment of Carnegie Institute. At
the turn of the century this de­
partment was known as the Car­
negie Technical Schools. Since 
C>900 steady growth has occurred 
until today four undergraduate 
and five graduate degree-confer­
ring divisions make up the pres­
ent Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology.
Enrollment
Enrollment has grown from a 
handful of local students to 3600 
from every state of the union and 
iio foreign countries. Additionally 
the evening school serves another 
1700 students most of whom are 
employed during day hours in 
business and industry in the 
greater Pittsburgh district.
The new and separate Board 
Will allow Tech to consolidate its 
local interests while at the same 
time increase its national mem- 
f'>ership.
Assured Success
In announcing the change, James 
M. Bovai’d, Chairman of the Board 
stated that Benjamin F. Fairless, 
former President and Chairman of 
the Board, United States Steel 
Corporation, will be Honorary 
Chairman of the new Board and 
Chairman of that body’s Nominat­
ing Committee. Charles E. Wil- 
£on, former Secretary of Defense 
*~and a Tech alumnus, also will 
serve as a life trustee, and a mem­
ber of the Nominating Committee.
Commenting on thè new ap­
pointments, J. C. Warner, Presi­
dent of Carnegie Tech had this to 
say: “We are extremely fortunate 
that Mr. Fairless and Mr. Wilson 
will be serving in these important 
positions. With their leadership 
on the Nominating Committee, 
Carnegie Tech will be assured 
t VOLLUVV in its announced program 
of making the Board more national 
in scope.”
Graduation Fee
A $10.00 graduation fee will 
be payable at registration 
time. This applies to all sen­
iors and those graduate stu­
dents who may be candidates 
for either the master or doc­
torate degree at the June, 
1960 Commencement.
February Date Set 
For Conference 
On Religion
The annual Campus Conference 
on Religion will be held dur­
ing the third week of second se­
mester, February 16-23.
The topic of the conference, 
which will consist of many small 
discussion groups, will concern 
the relationship of our religious 
and moral beliefs to the powerful 
materialistic drive that exists in 
America today.
This topic will be presented by 
Mr, Gus Tyler, director of the 
training institute of the Interna­
tional Ladies Garment Workers 
Union, at the introductory assem­
bly to be held on Tuesday, Feb­
ruary 16 at 4:30 in the GSIA Au­
ditorium.
This assembly will be attended 
by representatives from the vari­
ous campus housing units who 
will assist faculty members in 
leading discussions during the fol­
lowing week.
Cameron Choir
Cameron Choir will hold 
its winter concert in More- 
wood Gardens recreation room 
Thursday, January 14, at 8:00 
p.m. The admission is free.
Patterns Plans First 
Meeting For Feb. 4
The first formal meeting of Patterns, Carnegie’s em­
bryonic literary-arts magazine, will be held on Thursday, 
February 4, at 4:30 in Morewood’s Dorm Council Room.
At that time the many students who have applied for 
positions on the publication and*
those who still wish to apply will 
meet together with Mortar Board 
in order to clarify the intention 
of the magazine, exchange ideas, 
and further organizational plans.
Election
At a meeting a week later, 
Mortar Board will elect the edi­
torial staff, and the publication 
will begin to function immediate­
ly. The response to the magazine 
on the part of the student body 
has been an energetic one. There 
is still a great deal of room for 
more interested students in both 
the literary and art phases of the 
organization as well as the busi­
ness side. Mortar Board invites
more applications to be sent to 
the honorary, c/o the Dean of 
Women’s office or Mickey Coburn 
at Morewood Gardens.
Surrounding Colleges 
Surrounding colleges have tak­
en note of Carnegie’s new en­
deavor and have written congrat­
ulatory letters and notes request­
ing an exchange of literary maga­
zines so that we might learn from 
each other’s publications. Mortar 
Board hopes that the Tech stu­
dents will help to carry through 
the plan for thr magazine so that 
its accomplishment may open new 
vistas for individuals and our col­
lege as a whole.
Scholarship
Scholarship applications for 
the academic year 1960-61 are 
now available in the office of 
the Committee on Financial 
Aid, AH 154. They must be 
returned by March 15.
Hirshberg Chosen 
New Head Grid 
Coach For Tech
Edward J. Hirshberg, former 
assistant coach at Carnegie Tech, 
has been appointed head coach at 
Carnegie Tech. The appointment 
fills the vacancy recently created' 
by the untimely death of former 
head coach Dr. Eddie Baker.
Baker and Hirshberg were to­
gether on various coaching staffs 
for fifteen years and played on 
the same team for two years pre­
vious to entering the coaching 
field. There is probably no one 
who was closer to the late great 
Dr. Baker than Hirshberg and 
Baker always credited him with 
playing a big part in Tech suc­
cessful football fortunes over the 
last ten years.
Played for Pitt
Eddie Hirshberg received his 
A.B. from the University of Pitts­
burgh in February, 1932. He 
played on some of Jock Suther­
land's mightiest football teams as 
an end and was named captain of 
the team in his final season in 
1931.
Following graduation from the 
University of Pittsburgh, Eddie 
went to St. Thomas College as an 
assistant coach in 1932. He re­
turned to his alma mater to join 
Baker and Bill Kern and remain­
ed as an assistant from 1933 
through 1936. From 1937-41, Eddie 
was on the coaching staff at Dart­
mouth College and in 41-42 served 
as an assistant at West Virginia 
University and later at Yale Uni­
versity.
Joined Marine Corps
In 1943 Eddie joined the marine 
corps and coached service football 
teams for the next four years. 
Following his discharge he again 
joined Eddie Baker to guide the 
McKeesport Ironmen, a local inde­
pendent team, to 16 straight wins.

ATOMS IN YOUR FUTURE?
You are looking at a photograph recently 
released by the Atomic Energy Commission. 
It shows the Commission’s heavy water plant 
near the banks of the Savannah River in 
South Carolina. It is but one unit of an 
atomic energy project that covers more 
ground than the entire city of Chicago.
This vast installation was built by Du Pont 
at government request in 1950 for cost plus 
$1. Still operated by Du Pont, it stands as a 
bastion of strength for the free world. Equally 
important, her^ are being expanded horizons 
of nuclear engineering which will eventually 
lead to better living for all of us.
Like hundreds of other Du Pont research 
projects, probing the mysteries of the atomoje
has led to all kinds of new jobs. v£L,3,5R 
jobs. In the laboratory. In production. In 
administration. HEE. jobs that contribute 
substantially to the growth of Du Pont and 
our country’s security and prosperity.
What does aU this have to do with you?
For qualified bachelors, masters and doc­
tors, career opportunities are today greater at
Du Pont than ever before. There is a bright 
future here for metallurgists, physicists, math­
ematicians, electrical and mechanical engi­
neers, and other technical specialists, as well 
as for chemists and chemical engineers.4
Perhaps FEO will work in the field of atomic 
research and development. But that is only a 
small part of the over-all Du Pont picture. 
Your future LEOo. lie in any of hundreds of 
areas, from the development of new fibers, 
films or plastics to the exploration of solar 
energy. Or in the sale and marketing of new 
products developed in these and many other 
areas. In any case, you will be given respon­
sibility from the very start, along with train­
ing that is personalized to fit your interests 
and special abilities. We’ll help you work at 
or near the top of your ability. For as you 
grow, so do we.
If you would like to know more about 
career opportunities at Du Pont, ask your 
placement officer for literature. Or write E. 1.

Fighting Force,” will be on dis­
play on the military department 
floor of Margaret Morrison next 
Monday and Tuesday, January 
18-19.
Designed to authentically in­
form the public on how the Army 
is maintaining an effective atomic- 
age national defence, it illustrates 
the speed, and immensity of mod­
ern war, compares limited and 
general war, and explains Com­
munism’s territorial expansion as 
a result of 18 limited wars since 
1945.
The exhibition consists of 
push-button presentation showing 
the number of hours required to 
move a Strategic Army Corps 
(STRAC) Division from Fort 
Campbell, Ky., to various points 
throughout the world. Emphasized 
is the deployment of the standing 
army overseas and some of the 
Army’s newest equipment. A color 
motion picture showing new
weapons and equipment being put 
to use in actual field exercises is 
also included. The display is open 
to the public, and all students and 
interested parties are invited to 
attend

Tartan Hoopsters Engage ISTC 
Tonight On Indiana’s Court
With guards Bill Sofia and George Frazier really be­
ginning to hit their stride and Stan Skalka and Andy Komer 
doing more rebounding, Carnegie Tech coach, Mel Cratsley, 
is a little more optimistic for the remainder of the se^on.
Soffa and Frazier have hit for 128 points between them 
in the last three outings and have outplayed the highly pub­
licized backcourt teams of Mark DuMars and Wally Colender, 
Penn State; Cal Fowler and Ed Winters, St. Francis; and Tom 
Yancy and Larry Zeh, Geneva. Against Penn State, Soffa 
tallied 27 points and Frazier 19 to outscore the two Nittany 
Lion sharpshooters. In the game with the Covies, Bill had 28 
points, including 9 in the five minute overtime and Frazier 
had 17, 15 of which came in the second half. Against St. Fran­
cis, Frazier continued his pace by scoring 25 points, while 
Soffa could only muster up 12 points, still more than either 
Fowler or Winters scored.
Record Breaker <
Tech now stands 7-4 for the 
season and needs only three more 
wins to better its 9-15 record of 
last season. Soffa, meanwhile has 
tallied 216 points in 11 games thus 
far this season and has moved 
over the 900 mark for his career 
with 956 points. He needs only 
175 points in the remaining 13 
games this year to break Tom 
Craig's eight-year old mark of 
1130 set in four years of varsity 
play. Currently Soffa stands sixth 
in Carnegie’s all-time scoring rec­
ords behind Craig, Alan Frank, 
1125, Mike Theodore, 1049, Ralph 
Mocker, 1007, and Dick Fieler, 
984. If Bill continues his present 
pace he also will break his own 
single season mark of 420 points 
and about the only scoring record 
he doesn’t hold, most field goals in 
a season, 156, set by Tom Craig in 
the 1951-52 season. At this point 
he also stands an excellent chance 
of breaking his own record of 144 
free throws in a single season set
Carnegie Tartan
in 1957-58 and could surpass the 
career free throw mark of 379 
set by Alan Frank. Soffa current­
ly has 68 conversions this season 
and 290 in his career and needs 
only 86 more to surpass Frank’s 
record.
Games This Week
The Tartans will play three 
games this week with a home en­
gagement Monday against Grove 
city, an away meet with Indiana 
State Teachers College, tonight, 
and a benefit game with the Du- 
quesne Dukes Saturday at the 
Field House.
Tonight the Tartans will jour­
ney to Indiana, Pa., to meet In­
diana State Teachers College. The 
Indians are- always tough on their 
home floor and have been improv­
ing rapidly since Tech handed
them a 104-77 defeat in the sea­
son opener. On Wednesday of last 
week, Indiana handed Clarion its 
first loss of the season 80-69 and 
promises to be a real tough op­
ponent.
The Indians are led by their 
high scoring pair of forwards 
Harry Carnahan and Sam Sher­
wood. Both 6ft., they scored 683 
points between them last year. 
George Wise, a 6 ft. transfer 
guard who played only 6 games 
last season and tallied 96 pbints 
and Bill Pendleton, a 5 ft. 11 in. 
jumping-jack from Ford City who 
tallied 124 .points in eight games 
last season give the Indians two 
very strong outside men. Frank 
Cignetti, 6 ft. 2 in. senior, is the 
center and one of the strongest re­
bounders in the area.

Hirshberg—
MLE53,5OU. WYE0 NBRU 1] 
When Baker was named head 
coach at Carnegie in 1949, his first 
move was to obtain Eddie Hirsh­
berg as an assistant. Eddie has 
served in that capacity since that 
time.
When questioned as to how he 
felt about his new position, Hirsh­
berg said, “I am deeply honored 
to have been selected as the ne 
Carnegie Tech head football 
coach. Following in Dr. Baker’s 
illustrious footsteps seems an im­
possible task, but I shall certainly 
do the best I can.”
These are the silver wings of a 
U. S. Air Force Navigator. As a 
fly ing officer on the Aerospace 
team, he has chosen a career of 
leadership, a career that has 
meaning, rewards and executive 
opportunity.
The Aviation Cadet Program 
is the gateway to this career. To 
qualify for this rigorous and pro­
fessional training, a high school 
diploma is required; however, two 
or more years of college are highly „ 
desirable. Upon completion of the 
program the Air Force encourages 
the new officer to earn his degree 
so he can better handle the respon­
sibilities of his position. This in­
cludes full pay and allowances 
while taking off-duty courses un­
der the Bootstrap education pro­
gram. The Air Force will pay a 
substantial part of all tuition costs. 
After having attained enough 
credits so that he can complete 
course work and residence require­
ments for a college degree in 6 
months or less, he is eligible to 
apply for temporary duty at the 
school of his choice.
If you think you have what it 
takes to earn the silver wings of 
an Air Force Navigator, see your 
local Air Force Recruiter. Ask 
him about Aviation Cadet Navi­
gator training and the benefits 
which are available to a flying 
officer in the Air Force. Or fill in 
and mail this coupon.

SAE, ATO Battle For VB Crown
The regular season ended with four undefeated Volleyball teams occupying first place 
in their respective leagues. In the final league games, SAE “P” won over KS by scores of 
15-5, 11-15, 15-3; while SN “A” was defeating BSR “A” 13-15, 15-4, 15-8. In the other two. 
leagues victory did not come so easy as ATO “A” squeaked by BTP “A” in a thriller, with 
^>res of 15-9, 14-16, 15-13; and TDP “A” nosed out SAE “B” in one of the finest volleyball 
exhibitions in Tech history. The match lasted more than two hours and at one time every 
man on each team served without a point being made. The scores speak for themselves in 
describing the caliber of the game—Tau Delt over SAE “B” 15-13, 13-15, 17-15.

Playoffs began after the holi­
days with four fine second place 
teams (SAE “C,” BTP “A,” SAE 
“B” Kewman Club) pitted 
against the first place winners 
.NBR12 “A,’ SAE “P,” SN “A,” 
TDP “A”). Although the possi­
bilities of upset were good, the 
league winners showed their su­
premacy by continuing their win­
ning ways. ATO “A’ topped SAE 
“C” 15-3, 16-14; SAE “P” topped 
BTP “A” 15-2, 15-13; SN “A” 
topped SAE “B” 15-12, 15-4; and 
TDP over Newman Club 12-15,
15-9, 15-5.
The semi-finals took place the
r----------------
next night, with two of the four 
undefeated teams destined for the 
first blemish on their season rec­
ords. ATO “A’ and TDP “A,” two 
old basketball rivals, met in the 
V-ball playoffs for the first time 
in several years. The Alpha Tau’s 
surprised everyone including the 
Tau Delts in racking up dual 15-4 
decisions. ATO played fine team 
ball with strong spiking arid good 
court play while Tau Delt fell 
apart at the seams.
SAE “P” won a hard fought vic­
tory from a fine SN “A” team by 
score of 15-10, 9-15, 15-4. The 
^igma Nu’s with hard spiking and
fine net play won the second game 
as decisively as the SAE’s won 
the first and third. SAE’s spikes 
were equally hard, but their fine 
court play and accurate setting 
prove ’ to be the difference.
fx2UW,
For the third year in a row 
SAE and ATO will meet to de­
cide the CIT volleyball champion­
ship. ATO will be looking to 
avenge the dual 15-3 set backs at 
the hands of the SAE’s last year. 
In the consolation match, Sigma 
Nu led by fine court play should 
NU led by fine court play will 
meet a scrappy Tau Delt team.
Dr. Edward Baker, head football coach at Tech, and well 
known Pittsburgh dentist, died Tuesday, December 23, at 
South Side Hospital, following an operation Wednesday, 
December 16, for an intestinal disorder. He was 50.
Last November Dr. Baker was# 
h. nored as “Small College Coach 
of the Year” by the Curbstone 
Coaches of Pittsburgh.
He as bom in Nanticoke,
Pennsylvania, on August 22, 1909.
He attended the School of Den­
tistry at the University of Pitts­
burgh and received his D.D.S.- 
B.S. in 1932.
Eddie Baker has been on the 
Pittsburgh football scene since his 
playing days at the University of 
Pittsburgh in 1929-30. He was a 
fine quarte: -<ack for the Jock 
Sutherland coached team of 1929 
that was invited to play in the 
Rose Bowl. He had been associ­
ated with Carnegie Tech athletics 
for seventeen years, three as an 
assistant coach to Bill Kern and 
fourteen as Head Coach. He as­
sisted Kern in the 1937-38-39 sea­
sons which were Carnegie’s last in 
the big-time. Eddie succeeded 
Kern as Head Coach in 1940 and

played a major schedule for the 
next three years with a non-sub-

the result that he won only seven 
games while losing 15,
Return
After a tour of duty in the 
armed forces and a three year 
term as head coach at Shady side 
Academy, Eddie Baker returned 
to Carnegie Tech in 1949 to take 
over the reins of a football team 
that had won only one game in its 
last 26 and at one time had gone 
25 games in succession without 
winning a single contest. In his 
first year, Baker guided his team 
to a 4-3-1 record giving Carnegie 
Tech its first winning season since 
the famed Sugar Bowl team of 
1938.
Since his return in 1949, Tech 
has suffered only one losing sea­
son and has enjoyed its greatest 
era in intercollegiate football win­
ning 58 games, losing 23 and 
tying four. Even more impressive 
is that fact that since losing to 
powerful Bucknell and Buffalo in 
the 1957 season, Baker had led his 
Tartan teams to the amazing rec­
ord of 18-3-1 over a three year 
sprjj.
Dr. Baker, whose wife died 
earlier this year, is survived by a 
son, Noel, 20, a student at the 
University of Miami. There is no 
doubt that his absence will greatly 
affect all of us here at Tech.

His “temporary” job became a career
Max P. Beere spent two years at the Uni­
versity of Hawaii while with the U. S. 
Navy, then earned his B.S. degree in 
Engineering at the University of Utah, 
where he served as technical lighting di­
rector for numerous campus theater and 
television shows.
On graduating in 1955, he fancied a 
television career for himself, but felt that, 
being married, he couldn’t afford to serve 
a TV apprenticeship.
Max had an interview with the Pacific 
Telephone and Telegraph Company in 
Los Angeles. “I was pffered a position in 
transmission engineering,” he says. “It 
sounded great—but I really thought of it 
as a ‘temporary’ thing until I could get 
into television.”
Max’s TV career came sooner than he 
had hoped. Assigned as telephone com­
pany liaison with the TV networks, he 
was soon surveying microwave relay 
routes for the “Wide, Wide World” show, 
and working on “remote” and mobile 
telecasts from such interesting locations 
as Death Valley and rocket-launching 
sites deep in the desert
In August, 1958, he was transferred to 
San Diego, where he took on full respon­
sibility for TV-and-radio Special Serv­
ices. This led to a particularly satisfying 
assignment in early 1959—the develop­
ment of a new and successful closed-cir- 
cuit educational TV system for 18 
elementary schools in Anaheim.
“The telephone company really 
opened my eyes,” says Max. “It’s a fine 
place to work, where new ideas are wel­
comed and recognized and chances for ad­
vancement are excellent. I’m VEo. on it.”
