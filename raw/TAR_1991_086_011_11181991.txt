Union theft reported
By ERIN GRUNZKE
Tartan Staffwriter
Two computers were reported sto­
len from the Student Union office in 
Skibo. The incident occurred on 
Tuesday, November 12, between 
1:15 and 2:45 am. The Oakland Re­
view shares the office, Skibo 53, with 
Student Union.
The monitors, hard drives, and 
keyboards of a Macintosh Ilsi and a 
Macintosh SE were reported miss­
ing by complainant Christine 
McDaniels.
According to Chief of Security Jim 
LaPaglia, there were no signs of 
forced entry. “We processed the 
scene and were able to take some 
latent fingerprints. We are presently
checking to see who all has access to 
the room and who all has keys,” said 
LaPaglia. A total of seven people are 
known to have access and possess 
keys to the area. The price of the 
stolen property is unknown.
The robbery is thought to have 
been committed by someone with a 
key, because the lights were off, the 
windows shut, and the door locked 
when the burglary was discovered. 
According to Patrick Ohlin of the 
Student Union, this is the second 
Student Union break-in within the 
past few years. Ohlin said, “We’re 
obviously upset that it happened, 
but we’re working it out with [Carn­
egie Mellon University], and we’re 
still going to keep on printing pa­
pers.”

Senate is installed

Voter turnout was 
8.4 percent.
According to H&SS Senator

to try to consolidate the vote.
Some Senators are concerned 
that the newly elected Senators 
will cater to the interests of 
ROTC and not to their respec­
tive colleges.
Some Senators have pointed
to Section 1-C of the election 
rules as a possible cause of disci­
plinary action. The A Phi O elec­
tion rule, which gov- 
_______ ems the Senate elec­
tions, states, “There 
is to be no faculty, 
administration or 
departmental inter­
ference in Student 
Government Elec­
tions.” If it is re­
vealed that such in­
volvement existed in 
the campaigns ofthe 
SSI ROTC students, 
each Senator in 
ROTC would be forced to resign 
from Senate.

ROTC challenges resolution
By JENNIFER FORBES
Tartan News Editor
NROTC Battalion Com­
mander Ken Wilson requested 
at last week’s meeting that Stu­
dent Senate rescind their reso­
lution concerning the possible 
removal of ROTC from CMU if 
their policy discriminating 
againt gays, lesbians, and bi­
sexuals is not changed.
Wilson objected to the resolu­
tion because ROTC has no influ­
ence over the discriminatory 
policy mandated by the Depart­
ment of Defense.
Since Wilson is not a Senator, 
he could not make a motion to 
reconsider the resolution. How­
ever, Colin Crehan, PR chair,
did make the motion to recon­
sider the resolution after listen­
ing to Wilson’s appeal. Crehan 
said, “The motion was rushed 
through hastily, and there might 
be new evidence to consider.” 
Another issue brought up was 
that there were few people at 
the meeting when the resolu­
tion was voted on. Wilson said, 
“[Senate] didn’t ask for enough 
different opinions to be fair.” 
Crehan agreed that their 
“should be an open dialogue on 
the issue.”
Mike Tomblyn, a co-sponsor of 
the resolution, also wants a 
“campus-wide information ses­
sion.” “Then they can’t say Sen­
ate didn’t have the opinions of 
those people who cared,” he said.
The issue will be discussed ex­
tensively at tomorrow’s Senate 
meeting.
Another way to resolve this 
conflict would be a campus-wide 
referendum. To enact a referen­
dum, a Senator can make a mo­
tion for one, or anyone can put in 
a restraining peitition. The ref­
erendum would not necessarily 
be binding. Wilson would like to 
see a referendum because “it is 
way too big for Senate to decide 
themselves.” Crehan said, “[A 
referendum] is a good idea, but 
is in no way representative of 
the campus.” Tomblyn agreed, 
“I hope it doesn’t go to a referen­
dum. A campus referendum 
doesn’t mean anything ... be­
cause of the sheer apathy.”
Dining Service discusses deficit
tion of evaluation surveys to dining 
facility users. The survey results, re­
flecting a marked decrease in utiliza­
tion of both Morewood and Highlander, 
determined a large part of a debt-re- 
duction plan presented to administra­
tion that included closing Morewood 
dining room.
Although CMDS’ plan represented 
only a preliminary possibility, both SDC 
and Student Government have firm 
positions against shutting down the 
Morewood facility. SaidPresident John 
Lakin, “SDC is determined to keep 
Morewood Cafe open.”
“We were sure that closing Morewood 
completely did not represent student 
interest. Students have made deci­
sions where to live based largely on 
those services,” said Student Govern­
ment representative Mike Ewedosh. 
While Dining Service maintains that
“we are not ruling anything out,” it has 
already presented a revised plan to 
administration that allows Morewood 
Cafe to remain in operation.
“This is not,” said Heydt, “a student- 
Dining Service battle. We are confi­
dent in SDC’s ability and are interested 
in a union of ideas.” In Tuesday’s meet­
ing which concentrated on debt reduc­
tion, CMDS conceded that, while ser­
vice format changes are in order, 
Morewood Cafe is an essential facility. 
“Odds are, however,” said Lakin, “that 
MorePizza will close.”
MorePizza’s demise will tackle only 
about one-third of Dining Service’s debt. 
“Further cuts need to be made,” said 
Lakin. Reductions in Domino’s allow­
ances and an optioh to use money ear­
marked for improvementwill lend 
CMDS the leeway to spread the re-

Senate overrides fiscal policy
By LESLIE ZUBATY
Tartan Staffwriter
Student Senate recently 
passed the spring budget, and 
overrode the 
fiscal policy in 
several cases.
A number of 
organizations 
went over 
their indi­
vidual bud­
gets for last 
year, and al­
though policy 
states that the 1990-91 deficit 
should be deducted from this 
year’s budget, Student Senate 
made some exceptions. Funding 
and Recognition Committee
Chair Terrel Dean said, “Bud­
get cuts were severe last year 
and most groups made a genu­
ine effort to stay within the bud­
get.”
Rules Committee Chair Tom 
Strong, however, feels that Stu­
dent Senate could have “taken 
more care” in making its deci­
sion. Strongwasnotpleasedwith
the overall decision, and he re­
ports that although there is prob­
ably enough funding for the rest 
of the year, money will be tight.
A two-thirds vote was needed 
and met to 
pass the over­
rides. Among 
the organiza­
tions granted 
special sub­
sidy alloca­
tions is Aiki­
do at CMU, 
which is a 
first-time or­
ganization and should not have 
been granted a subsidy exceed­
ing $500.

Facing a projected debt of over 
$300,000, Dining Service, embarked on 
a series of discussions aimed at drag­
ging the administration from the red. 
While few firm commitments were 
forged, those attending, including SDC 
and Student Government representa­
tives, found that successful debt reduc­
tion is largely dependent on the fate of 
Morewood Cafeteria. “This was a new 
process,” says Roger Heydt, associate 
director of Dining Service. “It takes a 
while to get geared to thinking openly 
and sharing concerns.”
The focus groups were brought to­
gether Monday, and were designed to 
benefit from both administrative and 
student input. The next step in a pro-

WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 (DJ)—Law­
makers upset about the B-2’s escalat­
ing cost have something new to fret 
over: It turns out that it may cost $3 
billion to stop building the radar-evad- 
ing bomber.
With Congress poised to approve a 
defense spending bill that does not call 
for purchasing any more B-2s, many 
lawmakers and their aides are focusing 
on the Pentagon’s huge financial li­
abilities if Northrop Corp.’s assembly 
line is closed down after building only 
the 15 planes currently under construc­
tion.
Taxpayers already have provided as 
much as $700 million to buy B-2 parts
beyond thoBe required for the 15 planes, 
according to congressional aides. In 
addition, this year’s defense spending 
bill earmarks $1.3 billion or so to keep 
subcontractors cranking out parts for 
B-2s that seem less and less likely to be 
built.
On top of that, congressional aides 
estimate reimbursementforotherwork, 
termination fees on certain fixed-price 
subcontracts, closing down and 
mothballing highly classified produc­
tion equipment, and certain other pen­
alties easily could amount to $1 billion 
if the B-2 fleet is capped at 15.
An Air Force spokesman said, “there 
is no way to calculate termination costs”
until officials study the final language 
of the defense bill, and congressional 
committees haven’t released any de­
tails about the issue. In a bizarre twist, 
the prospect of hefty termination costs 
has become part of a last-ditch cam­
paign to try to salvage the program, for 
which Congress already has commit­
ted more than $33 billion. Lawmakers 
eager to take credit for killing the B-2, 
argues Rep. William Dickinson of Ala­
bama, the ranking Republican on the 
House Armed Services Committee, 
must “own up to the fact that they voted 
to spend billions on the coffin.”
Even Northrop executives seem re­
signed to the fact that nowhere near
the 75 planes the Air Force wants will 
be built. “Certainly, the signal being 
sent is that the B-2 is in a lower priority 
spot,” acknowledged Richard Taylor, 
Northrop’s chief financial officer. With­
out more B-2 production, the company 
would go from being a $5.5 billion-a- 
year aerospace powerhouse to basically 
a $3 billion industry subcontractor with 
strong cash flow.
As long as the eventual size of the B-
2 fleet remains unresolved, Northrop 
must keep exercising annual options 
with its suppliers. So far, according to 
the General Accounting Office, 
Northrop has purchased components 
for installation in 27 B-2s.
Northrop, for its part, has been in. 
demnified by the Air Force for the 
roughly $2 billion in investments it has 
made in facilities, tooling, computers 
and other equipment. Most of that al- 
ready has been depreciated, Taylor said 
but Northrop still might elect to re­
cover $100 million to $200 million by 
selling certain assets back to the gov. 
emment.
In addition, subcontractors making 
long-lead items for planes that are never 
built would be entitled to special tenrii- 
nation fees, according to Taylor. 
Northrop would be allowed to take .a 
slice of any money flowing from the Air 
Force back to subcontractors. myCI LiCAZSlgACim

WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 (DJ) — The House 
overwhelmingly cleared a compromise $5.2 bil­
lion measure that would provide up to 20 addi­
tional weeks of federal assistance to unemployed 
workers who have exhausted their regular ben­
efits.
President Bush, who successfully vetoed two 
earlier extended unemployment benefits bills, 
has said he will sign this one.
The measure now goes to the Senate, which took 
up the issue Friday.
The House approved the latest version of the 
unemployment bill on a vote of296-30.
Although considered non-controversial com­
pared with the two earlier versions, the latest 
measure could still face problems securing quick 
Senate approval. That’s because not all of the 
individual states are treated equally under the 
measure and certain senators from some of the 
disadvantaged states reportedly may object to 
considering the bill under an expedited proce­
dure.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, 
the measure, if enacted as passed by the House, 
would pump out $4.6 billion in unemployment 
and certain other benefits in the fiscal year ending 
Sept. 30,1992, and about $5.2 billion over the five 
fiscal years ending in 1996.
The major budgetary offset is a provision that 
would speed up collections of estimated tax from 
approximately 400,000 wealthy taxpayers. That 
step would have only a one-year effect and bring 
in an estimated $2.6 billion in the current fiscal 
year.
Another major financing mechanism contained 
in the unemployment benefits bill is a provision 
that grants the Internal Revenue Service perma­
nent authority to withhold from tax refunds debts 
(such as overdue student loans) owed by taxpay­
ers to other federal agencies. Such authority isn’t 
scheduled to expire until January 1994, but under
vagaries of the budget act, $1.1 billion in extra 
revenues can be credited to the current fiscal year 
as a result of the extension and $1.74 billion can 
be credited over the five years ending with fiscad 
1996.
The bill also raises revenue by extending the 
federal unemployment tax on employers at the 
prevailing temporary rate of 0.8 percent for an 
additional year. Under prevailing law, the rate is 
scheduled to drop back to 0.6 percent after 1995.
In another financing provision, the bill makes a 
variety of changes to the guaranteed student loan 
program aimed at achieving a better repayment 
rate in future years.
Most significantly, the measure would require 
lenders making unsecured student loans to ob­
tain a report on the borrower from a national 
credit bureau for clients over 21 years old. Appli­
cants with adverse credit histories would be re­
quired to have a co-signer.
Although the unemployment bill is scored as 
being essentially budget neutral over a five-year 
period, it would increase the deficit by about $900 
million in the current fiscal year.
The speedup in estimated taxes would apply 
only to taxpayers who expect to have adjusted 
gross income of $75,000 in 1991 and who expect to 
see their income increase by at least $40,000 over 
1990.
Arguing against the measure during floor de­
bate, Rep. Bill Archer (R-Texas), the ranking 
minority member on the Ways and Means Com­
mittee, said that the estimated tax speedup will 
exacerbate the unfairness and complexity of the 
tax code. “People will be blind-sided,” he said.
Most other legislators dismissed such concerns, 
however. The majority of those who spoke ex­
pressed relief that a compromise among the presi­
dent, and the Democrats and Republicans in the 
House had finally been reached on the conten­
tious unemployment benefit issue.
Congress rejects bank-aid bill
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 
(D J) — For the second time in 
two weeks, the House rejected 
legislation that would have re­
structured the U.S. financial 
system.
Key to the bill is a provision 
that would provide $70 billion 
to replenish the government’s 
deposit insurance fund, which 
has been pushed to the brink of 
insolvency by record levels of 
bank failures.
“Guaranteeing our deposits 
in all of our banks, that’s what 
this legislation is all about,” 
said House Minority Leader 
Robert Michel, (R-IU.)
The bill failed despite the 
heavy lobbying of the real es­
tate and insurance industries 
and by President Bush, who 
joined the bank reform debate
for the first time this fall.
“The Congress must pass leg­
islation this year that will re­
capitalize the Bank Insurance 
Fund and make a significant 
start on fixing the underlying 
structural problems that affect 
our bankingindustry,”Bush said 
in a letter to Michel.
“Simply pouring money into 
the fund — without fixing the 
industry so it can pay its own 
way — would leave taxpayers 
exposed.”
Bush, however, was unable to 
bring enough Republicans to 
guarantee final passage. Despite 
the support of Speaker Tom 
Foley, (D-Wash.), Democrats 
also turned away from the bill.
The bill contained a number of 
reforms in bank operations and 
federal oversight. Aside from
bailing out the deposit fund, 
the bill would have strength­
ened the ability of federal regu­
lators to intervene early wit^ 
weak institutions, curbed the, 
Federal Reserve’s ability tfl 
provide extended credit, and 
forbade government backing of 
foreign deposits.
Among other things, the bill 
would have expanded the Fed's 
authority over foreign bank en­
try into the U.S., modestly 
scaled back the government’? 
deposit insurance safety net, 
and eased certain regulatory 
mandates on savings and 
loans.
House leaders have prom­
ised to try again on a smaller 
bill that would replenish thgj 
bank fund but ignore the larger 
issues such as branching.Russian government ends crisis
MOSCOW, Nov. 11 (AP) — 
The Russian legislature last 
Monday passed a resolution call­
ing for a political solution to the 
crisis in the secessionist south­
ern enclave of Chechen- 
Ingushetia, renouncing an ear­
lier declaration of emergency 
rule.
Boris Yeltsin, who ordered the 
emergency rule, wasn’t present 
when members of the Russian 
Supreme Soviet voted 126 to 21 
to adopt the resolution in prin­
ciple.
Chechen-Ingushetia’s week- 
old independence declaration is 
Yeltsin’s first major separatist 
challenge. This issue presents 
Yeltsin with the same dilemma
Soviet President Mikhail 
Gorbachev frequently faces on a 
national level by republics want­
ing to leave the union.
Yeltsin responded toughly, 
declaring emergency rule in 
Chechen-Ingushetia on Friday 
and vowing to prevent the break­
up of his republic.
Two of Yeltsin’s close allies, 
Vice President Alexander 
Rutskoi and speaker Ruslan 
Khasbulatov, backed the reso­
lution, signalling that the Rus­
sian president had decided to 
retreat from a confrontation.
The crisis threatened to badly 
damage the authority ofYeltsin, 
who emerged as the most pow­
erful Soviet leader after the
failed hard-line coup in August 
against Soviet President Mikhail 
Gorbachev. "
The situation remained tense 
in the Chechen-Ingush capital 
of Grozny, where militants fired 
automatic weapons in the air 
and honked car horns to èel- 
ebrate the Russian retreat.
To date there has been no sign 
of compromise from the 
Chechen-Ingush leaders on their 
declaration of independences

Undergrad commission convenes
By MIKE LBPPERT
fartan Contributing Editor
^Although the Carnegie Mel- 
flh community may have forgot­
ten its initial enthusiasm about 
the formation of the Commis­
sion for Undergraduate Educa­
tion nearly seven weeks ago, Vice 
provost for Undergraduate Edu­
ction Erwin Steinberg is striv­
ing t0 guarantee that the Com­
mission remains on target in 
accomplishing its goal — to as­
sess and improve undergradu­
ate education and opportunities 
for all students on campus. 
mAt the initial meeting on Sep­
tember 30, 1991, the Commis­
sion generated a list of perceived 
“problems,” or concerns, with un­
dergraduate education at Carn­
egie Mellon University. The 
members then chose ten initial 
ffcask forces” to address what 
they felt were the most pressing 
and immediate concerns facing 
undergraduates.
Each task force is made up of 
Commission members with spe­
cific interests in that area. Addi­
tional task force members are 
chosen for noted expertise and/ 
or interest in the field. Each 
task force is to assess the 
University’s strengths and 
Weaknesses in responding to the 
ïàsk force’s area of concern and 
report back to the entire Com­
mission with a specific plan of 
action to augment and improve
'As head of the Commission, 
Steinberg is responsible for ap­
pointing task force chair posi­
tions and making sure the pro­
cess of inquiry, exploration, and 
recommendation moves as 
cjuickly and smoothly as pos­
sible. In choosing task force 
chairs, he said he looked for 
people with “respect in both edu­
cation and research ... for high 
prestige faculty.” He feels that 
jsuch high profile leadership un- 
3erscores his and President Rob­
ert Mehrabian’s commitment to 
; making the Commission an in­
tegral part of the University and 
achieving its goal of changing 
-undergraduate education for the 
students.
Steinberg recognizes that 
inhere is also a penalty in ap­
pointing these people. By and 
large, prominent University 
rmembers “can’t run everything 
'«-they are already busy people.” 
As a result, although the task

have met at least once, there 
remains much more to do. 
“Things are moving,” said 
Steinberg, “but they could go 
faster.”
Steinberg has set a series of 
deadlines to help keep the task 
forces on target. By January 1, 
1992, each task force will have a 
charter co-written by the mem­
bers of the task force and 
Steinberg that will detail the 
issues under investigation and 
map a specific plan of action. By 
April 1, 1992, most, if not all, 
task force recommendations 
should be presented to the Com­
mission. All task force recom­
mendations should be ready to 
be implemented at this time or, 
if necessary, abletobepresented 
to the campus community for 
discussion. Task forces should 
also generate cost estimates for 
recommendations in “discrete 
packages” to be presented to 
Mehrabian during this time.
“People,” says Steinberg, “are
waiting to be shown what [the 
Commission] can accomplish.” 
He points out, however, that “the 
task forces are more important 
than the Commission,” because 
it is the task forces that do all of 
the investigative work. The Com­
mission is solely an administra­
tive body.
There is “general goodwill 
around campus, and people 
agree to serve when asked,” says 
Steinberg about the Commis­
sion. He remains concerned, 
however, about the time con­
straints of task force members 
and the fast approaching dead­
lines they are working under. 
“Students are harder to pull in 
[to work with the task forces] 
than faculty,” he says, and as a 
result, may mistakenly be left 
out of the decision making pro­
cess. It is important, he feels, for 
the task force chairs to keep this 
in mind, and make efforts to 
prevent these exclusions from 
happening.

Alcohol policy presented
By MEGAN DIETZ
Tartan Contributing Editor
Pi Lambda Phi president Jon 
Caron has submitted a new 
alcohol policy to the InterFra- 
temity Council.
The new policy, which will 
be proposed this Tuesday night 
at this week’s IFC meeting, is 
similar to the current policy in 
that it requires the following: 
each activity must have a 
stated endingtime afterwhich 
no alcohol may be served, all 
guests must be checked for ID 
and marked according to their 
age (under 21 or 21 and older), 
no visibly intoxicated person 
may be served alcohol, and 
each house hosting a party 
must provide a “sober patrol,” 
a group of house members who 
stay sober for the entire party 
and monitor alcohol use at the 
party.
However, the proposal has 
some new features, as well. 
First, the proposal prohibits 
the “purchase and/or use of a 
bulk quantity of... alcoholic 
beverage,” including kegs. Ac­
cording to IFC Social Chair 
Jon Pollack, a senior IM ma­
jor and a SAE brother, “Kegs 
are none of our [IFC’s] busi­
ness. That may change in the 
future and it may not, but 
right now, it’s up to the indi­
vidual houses to take care of 
themselves in that respect.”
Caron’s proposal would also 
prohibit “open parties where 
alcohol is present, meaning 
those [parties] with unre­
stricted access by non-greek- 
members, without specificin- 
vitation.” The days of “all 
women invited” would be 
over.
Accordingto Caron, the pro­
posal is not necessarily the
final version which will be ac­
cepted by IFC. “It’s more of a 
basic written draft to start 
working from than a ‘proposed 
policy1,” he said.
Pat Harned, assistant to the 
dean of student affairs and IFC 
advisor, is pleased to see IFC 
working conscientiously to­
ward improving its alcohol 
policy. “Jon [Caron] has passed 
out copies to all of the members 
so that they can consider it 
carefully before discussing it 
this week. The proposal will 
also be examined by a lawyer 
to make sure everything’s okay 
in that area,” she said.
“I don’t know if this is the 
policy they want, but I like the 
way they’re going about it,” she 
said. “It’s a big thing for them 
to have to wrestle with, and I 
think it’s good that they’re tak­
ing it slowly and putting so 
much thought into it.”
Budget approved
BUDGET, from page 1.
that Student Senate can subsi­
dize were also violated for 
Spring Carnival and Sweep­
stakes, as well as for the Health 
Awareness Health Fair. In the 
case of the Health Fair, con­
sulting fees were the only viola­
tion. Senate Senate justified 
this override by recognizing the 
large benefit the fair offers to 
the campus.
Other concerns regarding the 
budget packet surfaced as well. 
Uncertainty arose as to whether 
the Voices United Gospel Choir 
was a completely non-religious 
organization. According to
Senate’s constitution, religious, 
political, and academic organi­
zations can not receive Activi­
ties Fee funding. Also men­
tioned was the exceedingly large 
amount of money given to club 
sports , particularly the Uni­
versity Rowing Club. Strong re­
ports that the Rowing Club re­
ceived approximately $28,000, 
while the average total budget 
for an organization of a similar 
size should be about $5,000.
Senate is concerned about the 
overall increase in fall budgets, 
for Senate simply could run out 
of money if too many exceptions 
are made.
Corrections...
In last week’s article, “Fra­
ternities consider alcohol policy 
alternatives,” three fraterni­
ties were incorrectly associated 
with their alcohol risk man­
agement policies. Sigma Tau 
Gamma does not belong to the 
Fraternity Insurance Purchas­
ing Group (FIPG), and Delta 
Tau Delta and Phi Kappa 
Theta belong to a policy that is 
similar to FIPG.
The Tartan corrects all er­
rors of fact. If you know of an 
error, please contact Beth Moses 
at x2111 or write her care of

Audience Participation:
Kenny Wilson: Asking Senate to re- 
considerthe resolution passed lastweek 
regarding the ROTC program at CMU. 
ROTC units do not make Department 
of Defense policy, nor do they have the 
power to disregard or change that policy. 
This resolution will not have any effect 
on the Department of Defense policy 
regarding homosexuals and bisexuals 
in the military service. However, it will 
have, and it has already had, a definite 
negative effect on the perceptions and 
attitudes of ROTC students and staff, 
as well as others towards the homo­
sexual community and the Student 
Senate. I hope you will reconsider your 
vote on the resolution, considering you 
do represent the student body and Sena­
tors should vote so as to represent the 
will of their constituents. It is good for 
Senate to take a stand against dis­
crimination; however, it is wrong to 
punish the wrong people.
APhiO:UMOC will be heldnext week, 
please participate. Donations will go to 
charity.

Dining Service 
considers cuts
CMDS, from page 1
mainder out over four years. Heydt 
however, points out that, “We are evalu- 
ating a diverse set of criteria. Nothing 
here is definite.”
“Dining Service has until Christmas 
break to convince students to stay on 
the meal plan,” says Lakin. “It needs to 
get nitty-gritty.”
“The first step here is to identify a 
new meal plan and to reevaluate our 
format,” comments Heydt. CMDS has 
begun a process to revamp and expert- 
ment with formatted menus that offer 
“more consistency” and proven favored 
types of food. Says Heydt, “We are 
seriously discussing new options for 
Highlander and Morewood Cafe that 
reflect more of the students’ buying 
preferences.” CMDS has recruited the 
help of Marriott International to con­
sult on determining what students want 
and how it can be provided.
Dining Service is additionally at 
tempting to mold its attention around 
a theory of “theme dining.” “We want 
to provide a specific selection of food we 
know people will want.” Heydt has con­
sidered options such as puttinga nightly 
grill in Highlander and restructuring 
its menu.
Pravin Ratnam, SDC Food Commit­
tee chair, has been deeply involved in 
the discussion of possible changes. 
“Morewood Cafe is likely to become a 
place for deli sandwiches for lunch and 
hot entrees for dinner. There will also 
be some experiments with the type of 
food at Highlander— more consistent, 
predictable items. We are trying to get 
away from the vague items no one is 
eating.”
“We want to have a new meal plan in 
place by the end of the year,” says 
Heydt. “What we are trying to do in 
about a month might usually take twp. 
or more.” Dining Service has planned a 
more detailed survey, concentrating on 
feeling out student preference on food 
type, time offerings, and prices. The 
survey is due out next week.

Write-in campaign legality questioned
ELECTIONS, from page 1
committee, requesting an in­
vestigation into the legality 
of the write-in campaigns.
“The elections board has re­
ceived some complaints, and 
they will be brought up be­
fore the elections committee,” 
said Woodford. The board will 
decide today on what actions 
to take on the matter.
The main allegation of the 
investigation request is that 
a faculty member helped dis­
tribute campaign papers. 
According to A Phi O service 
Vice President Nathanial 
Szewczyk, “I don’t have any 
evidence to support that 
claim.” However, he believes 
an investigation will turn up 
any remaining facts. “I don’t 
doubt the integrity of any of 
the military officers on this 
campus,” he said.
NROTC Battalion Com­
mander Ken Wilson scoffs at 
any questions concerning the 
write-in campaign’s validity. 
“There is no rule against
write-in candidates winning 
an election,” he said. He af­
firms that the candidates ran 
for office completely volun­
tarily. According to Wilson, 
any idea of coercion on the 
part of him or ROTC admin­
istration is “absolutely wrong, 
without a doubt.”
In CIT, the new Senators 
are Chuck Sweeny, Gregory 
Haverkamp, Joseph Gold­
man, Daniel Schmick, 
Stephen Lightfoot, and Dulcie 
Hernandez. CFA is repre­
sented by Moneet Singh and 
James Albert. In GSIA, Rob 
Byrne was elected, and in 
H&SS, Brent Was and Seth 
Halvaksz were elected. In 
IMt, Matt McGarvey and 
Matt Wood-head were 
elected, and in MCS, Shawn 
Knight, Eric Moore and Rob­
ert Earhart were elected. The 
other elected senators are 
Erik Altmann and J ay Laefer 
for the SCS and Jose Madera 
and Steve Sorenson in a tie 
for SUPA.

FORUM
Representatives must remember constituents
In the recent Student Senate 
elections, 10 of 17 contested seats 
on Student Senate were filled 
by ROTC-affiliated candidates, 
the majority of whom ran on a 
write-in campaign. There is an 
opinion on campus that it is not 
fair for ROTC to “take over Sen­
ate,” which is unfounded. These 
Senators-elect have been cho­
sen by the members of their col­
leges to represent their constitu­
encies and have every right and 
responsibility to fulfill their 
elected positions.
The success of this write-in 
campaign is an example of what 
a group of motivated students 
with a plan of action can accom­
plish. These students saw a way 
to take action on something that 
affected them — in this case, 
Senate’s “Resolution Against 
Discrimination by ROTC at Car­
negie Mellon.” If all students 
were so motivated and con­
cerned about what Senate does 
and who represents them in 
Senate, the overall turnout 
would have been amazing. As it 
is, those who were concerned 
went out and voted for the people 
who would best represent their 
positions. And those people won.
However, we would like to re­
mind all Senators that they were 
elected by members of their col­
leges and their responsibility is 
to them and not to members of 
any special interest group. Sena­
tors are not elected as represen­
tatives of ROTC, cmuOUT, or 
even FRINGE. Senators repre­
sent their constituents in H&SS, 
IM, CIT, MCS, CFA, SCS, GSIA,
rent and future, must keep this 
fundamental in mind when con­
sidering any issues that come 
before Senate.
In particular, one issue on 
which all Senators must keep 
their responsibility to their con­
stituents in mind is the upcom­
ing discussion of CMU, ROTC, 
and discrimination. The Sena­
tors considering the fate of the 
resolution are not the contro­
versial Senators-elect, but 
rather the same group that 
passed it to begin with. This 
situation is one that concerns 
and affects a large portion ofthe 
Carnegie Mellon community, as 
is evident in the results of the 
election.
With any issue of such magni­
tude and of interest to so many 
people, a good method of deci­
sion wouldbe a referendum vote, 
in which every concerned indi­
vidual would have the chance to 
vote as his or her conscience 
demanded. This would eliminate 
the concerns over “conflict of in­
terest” in the Senate. It would 
also give a truer picture of the 
campus’ opinion on the matter.
Whether the ROTC discrimi­
nation issue goes to a referen­
dum vote or not is up to the 
Senators. It is the Senators’ re­
sponsibility to their constituents 
to make the best choices con­
cerning issues that will affect 
large portions of the student 
body.
Senators must remember who 
they represent and not allow 
involvement in special interest 
groups or personal concerns to
and SUPA. All Senators, cur- sway that representation.Newspaper controversy compromises rights
Across the country, some stu­
dent newspapers have had their 
First Amendment rights vio­
lated and their autonomy se­
verely compromised by the ad­
ministration of the universities 
of which they are a part. The 
universities are relying on a 
ruling by the Supreme Court 
that allowed for the censorship 
of high school papers.
At the Ohio State University 
Lantern, the administration ôfthe 
University appointed an “advisor” 
to the newspaper staff to read and 
censorthepaperforanythingthat 
he felt could be libelous or in oppo­
sition to the administration. The 
editors of the Lantern published 
under protest for a time and fi­
nally resigned, leaving OSU with 
no experienced staff to run the 
student paper.
In an example of censorship 
by other students, The 
Bucknellian of Bucknell Univer­
sity may be forced to stop pub­
lishing because the Student Sen­
ate there has cut its subsidy 
completely. These examples of 
censorship are appalling and we 
stand strongly against them.
A university should be a breed­
ing ground for ideas and an open 
forum for the exchange of those 
ideas. Closing down or limiting 
the scope of a student newspaper 
cannot possibly further this idea.
Carnegie Mellon has its own 
stand on free speech listed in 
the Student Handbook. It is very 
simple: “Carnegie Mellon Uni-

versity ... encourages freedom 
of speech, assembly, and ex­
change of ideas.”
In addition, the Pittsburgh 
Council on Higher Education 
made and the Carnegie Mellon 
Board of Trustees adopted the 
following statement on contro­
versial speakers andissues: “For 
their part, colleges and univer­
sities must hold vital the 
student’s right to know .... To 
fulfill fully this responsibility, 
the university must insure not 
only that no viewpoint is with­
held but that, within reason­
able limits, all major alterna­
tives are made available to its 
students.” The ideas behind such 
statements are what great uni­
versities are built on. CMU has 
the designed an environment in 
which all ideas can be presented 
and evaluated in the true spirit 
of a university.
The Tartan is proud to be part 
of a university community which 
does not believe in exerting fi­
nancial or administrative pres­
sure on its student publications 
and which upholds the intent of 
the First Amendment.
We protest what is happening 
at these other schools around 
the country. No university 
should attempt to forcibly affect 
what a newspaper, even a stu­
dent one, chooses to print. We 
offer our support to the Lantern 
and The Bucknellian and any 
other student newspaper expe­
riencing this kind of censorship.
Editor:
Ann Simonton,
“one of the nation’s 
leading authorities 
on media images...” 
as advertised by the 
Political Speakers Forum Board, pre­
sented her exposé entitled “Sex, Power, 
and the Media” last Monday evening. 
“Modeling is nothing more than glam­
orized prostitution!” I, too, raised an 
eye-brow and sat forward upon hearing 
such a claim.
Following this comment, Simonton 
proceeded to roll through her slide show 
with similarly questionable statements 
until she finally let it fly with “Adver­
tisements like these promote woman- 
hating.” I had a difficult time compre­
hending her assessment because up to 
that point many of the advertisements 
which she had shown were for women’s 
products! Undoubtedly, all of the ads 
she had chosen exuded sexual under­
tones which glamorized the sexuality 
of women. Color me silly, but for an 
extended period of time I have been 
under the impression that women en­
joy feeling sexy. According to Simonton, 
the times are changing.
Another discrediting aspect of 
Simonton’s lecture was the demonstra­
tive disobedience which she seemed to 
advocate through her collection of slides 
proudly recording the numerous ar­
rests she has accumulated over the 
years. Although she is quite pleased 
with her Radical Feminist role, by this 
behavior isn’t she jeopardizing the re­
spectability of the cause for which she 
stands?
One particularly absurd statistic she 
reported dealt with the physical abuse 
of women. She stated, “50 percent of all 
women experience some form of physi­
cal abuse by a male during their lives. 
Therefore, 50 percent of all men beat 
women.” I refrained from comment 
trusting that the idiocy of such a state­
ment was evident to the rest of the 
listeners. With this typeofpropaganda- 
like approach, how many people unde­
cided on the issue can honestly take her 
seriously? Furthermore, how can her 
actions be interpreted as constructive 
for her cause?
Let me first say that I do not consider 
myself to be a sexist by any means. I 
believe in equal opportunities for ev­
eryone, regardless of what type of char­
acteristics an individual possesses. 
However, Simonton did not seem to 
share my sentiments. Itis the extremely 
slanted approach to the issue which I, 
and others, found disappointing. Please 
do not misinterpret my point here. I 
found some of Simonton’s insights to be 
quite informative.
There clearly exist some harsh sexist 
elements in our society which need to 
be addressed with a firmer hand.
In retrospect, is this the approach 
that should be taken to correct the 
wrongdoings in our society? At times 
we need to step back and view the 
entire picture. Some individuals spend 
too long at too close of a distance where 
visions tend to blur reality.

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
The Sweepstakes 
Committee would 
like to thank the con­
scientious editors 
who contributed to 
last week’s buggy article [“Buggy safety 
needs push,” 11/11 ]. This insightful and 
thought-provoking article has initiated 
some drastic and overdue changes in 
the manner in which freerolls will be 
handled.
In the past, joggers and bikers have 
been allowed on the course because, 
quite honestly, we aren’t legally al­
lowed to keep them off. This was an 
egregious oversight by the committee 
and cannot be allowed to continue. 
Henceforth all flaggers will be equipped 
with not only the vest and flag as was 
required in the past. Flaggers will now 
also be equipped with high caliber paint 
guns with laser scopes to clearly mark 
possible offenders and will be required 
to attend at least one class in Akido to 
facilitate the removal of recalcitrant 
joggers.
Cars had been allowed to exit the 
course by following the organization’s 
follow cars. This was in an effort to 
promote good campus relations with 
members of the community who weren’t 
interested in waiting for three hours to 
exit the course. How could we have put 
the convenience of CMITs faculty and 
staff before the safety of the drivers? 
We are deeply ashamed of this over­
sight. Next semester people wishing to 
exit the parking lots before 9 am will 
have the option of hiring a helicopter to 
airlift their cars off the course. Any 
motor vehicles violating this policy will 
be dealt with by the National Guard 
stationed at 100 yard intervals around 
the course.
In general, we will strive to uphold 
the safety standards we have so obvi­
ously been ignoring. Safety consider­
ations can no longer be of secondary 
priority to the sweepstakes committee. 
The days of relaxed safety standards 
are over. It is with the greatest solem­
nity that we promise all involved to 
redouble our efforts to ensure that 
Buggy remains a safe and enjoyable 
practice for everyone.

Thus the University has demonstrated 
that it is willing to violaje its own 
statement of assurance when enough 
money or benefits for a suljset of stu­
dents is involved.
Despite the University’s active letter 
writing campaign, Washington contin­
ues to ignore the issue becaise it knows 
the University is unwillingto take ac­
tion. Only by threatening t) remove a 
major source of military officers can 
any result be achieved. I ind it sad, 
however, that a strong message can’t 
be sent to Washington witlout poten­
tially harming the heteroiexual stu­
dents who currently benefit from the

Editor:
I am pleased to see 
the students of Carn­
egie Mellon take a 
stand in opposition to 
ROTC’s discrimina­
tion against bisexuals, lesbians, and 
gays. I hope the staff council, Faculty 
Senate, and University administration 
will follow this example.
I am happy to work in an environ­
ment where I can be openly gay without 
fearing for my job. Unfortunately, this 
is not true for all jobs on the CMU 
campus. Currently, the Military Sci­
ence courses can only be taught by 
heterosexuals, and since the Univer­
sity gives credit for these courses, it is 
directly supporting discrimination.
Editor:
I object to the 
phrase in the edito­
rial entitled “Senate 
challenges ROTC,”
[11/11]: “Instead, 
they hurt the students who participate 
in ROTC ....”
First, the editors didn’t want the 
scholarship to be replaced, saying it 
would be unfair to give these students 
more than the minimal aid to cover 
financial need. Imagine you were ad­
mitted to CMU under full scholarship 
and suddenly you had your aid cut to 
your “financial need.” Also, we are all 
well-aware that the term “financial 
need” has no meaning, for the 
University’s idea of need and your 
family’s never quite jive.
As for “not allowing ROTC units to 
participate in Activities Fee-funded 
events such as Carnival...,” any Fee- 
paying student at CMU can participate 
in any and all activities funded by the 
Fee.
In talking to concerned ROTC stu­
dents, I found the biggest concern is of 
the Society of the Prow (SOP) being 
barred from booth. SOP is a Senate- 
recognized organization open to all 
members of the campus. It also re­
ceives no funds from ROTC or the De­
partment of Defense. Any organization 
fitting this description is free to partici-

Madness begins all over again
y
Jason McDonald
The slogan for this year’s Stu- 
jjnt Senate elections was “Stop 
t),eMadness.”Howutterlyironic, 
considering the madness is just 
beginning. One third of Senate 
(10 of the 17 seats up for grabs in 
d,e election) is now controlled by 
one student organization. To 
¡jalte things worse, only three of 
these people originally appeared 
on the Senate ballots, the rest a 
tesultofalate write-in campaign.
Of course, all of this stems from 
the Senate resolution calling for 
the eviction of ROTC from the 
Carnegie Mellon campus if dis- 
uiiiination against gays doesn’t 
eni While I definitely agree that 
the resolution was horribly mis­
guided — punishing a group of 
students for a policy they had no 
hand in making — I seriously 
question the means used to solve 
the problem.
The ROTC action was, well, a 
typical military solution. If you 
don’t like something, take it over. 
Itis being suggested, to the point 
ofbelligerence, that since it falls 
within the scope of the “Student 
Grenada” election rules, I should 
shut up and like it. A triumph for
student action! Hip, hip, hooray!
Not a chance in hell. I’m tired 
of the people I know (and usu­
ally respect) trying to tell me 
how I should feel about this. 
Apparently I should be doing a 
Snoopy-esque dance of joy about 
the fact that my college is repre­
sented by two ROTC candidates 
whose interest in Senate boils 
down to one issue. Oneofmyoh- 
so-caring friends is practically 
drooling in anticipation of the 
Letters to the Editor that this 
column is going to draw.
I’ll admit that I’ve mellowed 
since I first heard about the 
ROTC takeover. My knee-jerk 
reaction brought into play 
phrases such as “fascists” and 
“playgroundbullies.” Since then, 
I have focused better on reality 
(must be all the Thorazine), but 
I’m still very uneasy about 
what’s going on here.
The fact that the ROTC take­
over of Senate is legal doesn’t 
necessarily make it right — le­
gality is fact, while moral judge­
ment is based on your own per­
ceptions of the situation.
The candidacy of David Duke, 
who ran for governor of Louisi­
ana, is a higher-profile example 
of this. Yes, he’s legally entitled 
to run for office, and the Consti­
tution gives all the morons in 
“Red Stick” the right to vote for 
him, but that doesn’t make it
The “Twin Matts,” McGarvey and Woodhead, who won 
the seats from my home college (IM), do not, in my 
mind, represent me or any other IM student who is not 
in ROTC. They represent themselves and the interests of 
the organization to which they belong.
palatable to most sane members 
of society.
There’s no direct connection 
to the ROTC/Senate battle here 
(no, I’m not stating, or even im­
plying, that ROTC students are 
racists, in case you’ve already 
started typing “Editor:”), but the 
underlying point is the same.
My main complaint comes 
down to this: the “Twin Matts,” 
McGarvey and Woodhead, who 
won the seats from my home 
college (IM), do not, in my mind, 
represent me or any other IM 
student who is not in ROTC. 
They represent themselves and 
the interests of the organization 
to which they belong. Well, they 
also represent the Greek system 
in payback for the votes they 
mustered through that arm of 
the campus.
The same statement applies 
to the other ROTC-endorsed can­
didates, though I have no direct 
say in their elections. Student 
democracy, from the point of the
candidates, has apparently come 
down to re-defining your con­
stituency however you please.
It’s true that student apathy 
is most of the reason that this 
scheme worked, but that’s put­
ting the horse ahead of the car­
riage. Just to pose an example, if 
FRINGE took over Senate and 
raised its Activities Fee subsidy 
through the roof, people would 
be screaming bloody murder, 
since money is involved.
On the other hand, since this 
is a battle over just one resolu­
tion about a subject most people 
are uncomfortable with, anyway, 
they’ll just let what happened 
slide. That doesn’t make what 
happened right.
It also seems that my opinion 
shouldn’t count because my im­
promptu Senate candidacy was 
based on a joke —• my platform 
was “let’s get four votes and see 
what happens.”
I don’t quite understand the 
logic behind invalidating my
opinion on this basis; the joke 
was targeted at student apathy, 
not the role Senate plays on this 
campus. Were I elected, I would 
have served my term and tried 
to do a reasonably good job of it.
This is going to end up as one 
of those, “Yes it is! No it isn’t!” 
debates. The facts aren’t in any 
sort of dispute, so it boils down 
to people’s deeply-entrenched 
opinions which (if past history is 
any indication) don’t change. 
Yeah, I’ll get some nice flames, 
but I might also get a few people 
to see my side of the issue. At the 
very least, more people will take 
interest in what’s going on in 
StudentSenate, and that’s some­
thing Senate, for all its talk of 
“Stop[ping] the Madness,” 
couldn’t do.
Jason McDonald is a senior 
IM major who would have won a 
Senate seat if he had given his 
campaign more than half an 
hour of work.
Senate fails to realize repercussions
Chris Restifo
The past week has seen an enormous 
amountofhead-spinning activity, heated 
exchanges, and email flame wars. Of 
course, for those of you not in the center 
of it all, it has to do with the recent 
Student Senate resolution demanding 
that ROTC be removed from campus if 
the Department of Defense (DoD) policy 
against gays isn’t dropped. All discrimi­
nation matters aside, the events have 
shown a lack of communication between 
both sides of the issue.
What scared most people in ROTC was 
the clause that called for ROTC and 
BOTC-related activities to be prevented 
from participating in funded events like 
Carnival. Of course, such a claim that 
ROTC students would be banned was ill 
founded. Organizations like the Society 
ofthe Prow (SOP) are recognized groups. 
Sincemembershipis open to everyone on
campus, the SOP and other groups can 
participate in funded events.
Senate, however, didn’t do too well a 
job with explaining what they meant. 
Not all blame is to be put on them, how­
ever. It was an oversight on their part. 
From what I gather talking to Michael 
Tomblyn and Erik Altmann, co-sponsors 
of the bill, they had no intention of ban­
ning students from activities. They are 
taking action to correct the situation and 
make people informed.
Some things, on the other hand, were 
inexcusable. All the arguing and bicker­
ing, in part, extends from the fact that 
Senate literally pulled the resolution out 
of the blue. Until the press release was 
made, the only ones who knew about it 
were the sponsors, authors, the Academic 
Affairs committee, and anyone else spe­
cifically consulted. Students were igno­
rant of the existence of the resolution. 
When something this big comes up, it 
should be the senators* duty to inform 
students. Only now, after the passing of 
the resolution, are they inviting students 
to come and air their views and concerns. 
I think they didn’t realize the contro-
versy the resolution would cause.
Another thing that distresses me is the 
apparent disparity between what the 
senators felt and what they passed in the 
resolution. When I talked to Tomblyn
tors knew it had little chance of being 
taken seriously and was being used as a 
political statement. It might be easy to 
soothe my concerns by telling me face-to- 
face why things were done, but people on
It might be real easy to soothe my concerns by 
telling me face-to-face why things were done, 
but people on other campuses are going to 
read the resolution and take it at face value.
and Altmann, they said that many sena­
tors realized the resolution had no chance 
of being taken seriously by the adminis­
tration. Tomblyn even told me that he 
thought ROTC was a good way to produce 
intelligent leaders in the military.
Why, then, was the resolution passed? 
It was passed to make a statement. I’m 
glad to see that the Senate was willing to 
vote on something so important after 
only fifteen minutes of debate (according 
to one senator) and no student-consulta- 
tion. It is rather hypocritical of Senate to 
havepassedthe resolution when the sena-
other campuses are going to read the 
resolution and take it at face value. They 
are going to seriously think that CMU is 
intent on getting ROTC off campus and 
that senators here want it that way. No 
doubt, a few people are thinking that 
that’s the way things should be done, but 
presenting a false image of solidarity is 
rather counterproductive.
Why not make the resolution a referen­
dum? Some people have said that it 
would take too much time, it wouldn’t be 
worth it, and a whole bunch of other

they happen. At any other insti­
tution of higher learning, or at 
least at the ones where the stu­
dents have lives, the clusters sit 
empty; anyone seen inside is 
regarded by his or her fellow

Here, I’ve seen the tension over
who has the right to sit at a

point where the C-Con was ready 
to call in a special UN delega­

for everyone, but part of the rea­
son behind my dislike for being 
booted off of a computer is the 
fact that the offending user 
doesn’t always have a good, solid 
reason for doing it.
To put it bluntly, the activities 
for which computers are re­
served are often quite inane. One 
night I was sitting in a jam- 
packed cluster, slaving over a 
term paper of the death-length

research is given without restric­
tion to who can be hired to work 
on the software. CMU is free to 
hire anyone qualified for the 
position, regardless of sexual 
orientation.
The editors’ final problem was 
if discrimination does not end, 
CMU should remove ROTC by 
the end ofthe ‘96 school year. To 
paraphrase two prominent 
ROTC students, anyone who be­
lieves that this will happen is 
ignorant, a fool.
The administration will never
kick ROTC off campus. Then 
why the inclusion of this point? 
It worked well in educating the 
campus that there is definitely a 
problem with the policy. Also, 
we needed to show Warner Hall 
that this is an explosive issue 
that needs to be addressed now. 
Finally, I hope that this resolu­
tion sparks campuses around the 
country to rise up and address 
the issue.
Yes, “the intent of the Senate 
resolution is good.” So is the out­
come. More awareness on the
campus. Most ROTC students 
disagree with the policy and 
want to see it changed. Next 
time, get the facts.
And if you still don’t under­
stand, ask the sponsors of the 
proposal. You may just be sur­
prised!
I apologize to the campus for

forced to to please The Tartan

Senate recently passed a 
resolution eventually ban­
ning the ROTC program 
from CMU by 1996 to bring 
attention to the policy ex­
cluding homosexuals. In re­
sponse, ROTC members 
made a quick campaign that 
placed 10 new ROTC mem- 
bersonSenate. Whatdoyou 
think of the Senate reso­
lution banning ROTC by 
1996 and ofROTC’s Sen­
ate election victories?

“I don’t agree with the Senate 
resolution. Senate is taking out

like people who discriminate

“I think ROTC is like any

Results of being booted 
include frustration, violence
RESULTS, from page 7ingly logged out and began pre­
paring ihyself for the long trek 
over to UCC, but while zipping 
up my coat, I managed to catch 
a glimpse of what the girl who 
had booted me off the computer 
was actually doing on Andrew.
And although sending zephyr- 
grams to 30 of her closest com­
puter pals probably seemed im­
portant to her at that moment, I 
think that it would have been a 
better idea if she had decided to 
do something more productive, 
like pick the lint out from be­
tween her toes.
Another, well, annoyingthing 
about bding unceremoniously 
kicked off is the inherent rude­
ness involved. In fact, one of the 
things that bothers me most is 
the outright disregard for com­
mon decency often exhibited by 
the student who stakes a claim 
on my computer.
I might be sitting there writ­
ing an, okay, slightly risque let­
ter to my boyfriend (the stuff 
that long-distance relationships 
are made of, by the way) when I 
hear a congested throat-clear 
behind me: “Excuse me—I have 
this computer reserved. Now." 
Well, fine; just give me five min­
utes to finish up and log out — 
the last thing I need to hear at 
that particular moment is a na­
sal “You wanna do whatV.” com­
ing over my shoulder in a cas­
cade of foul-smelling breath.
If I’m going to die of embar­
rassment, I’d rather show up for 
class naked (unintentionally, 
that is), wet my pants during a 
test, or engage in any of the 
other equally probable scenarios 
I’ve dreamed up than experi­
ence the anticlimax of everyone 
in Hunt Apple Orchard finding 
out that my pet name is Cuddles- 
Wuddles.
Unbounded frustration and 
acute embarrassment aren’t the 
only things that can result from 
being booted. A dangerous pos­
sibility we should consider is the 
violence that might well arise 
from these computer reserva­
tion conflicts.
I for one would like to marry 
the student who doesn’t experi­
ence a feeling of unspeakable 
rage when he finds out 10 min­
utes after logging in that the 
computer he waited an hour to 
get is (sniveling voice) ... re­
served.
At the very least, we should be 
forewarned; perhaps the mes­
sage of the day could be indi­
vidually suited to each reserved 
computer to state: Warning! 
Before you leave this room, you 
will probably commit second- 
degree murder (if you happen to 
have a lethal weapon on you;) 
otherwise, your blood will boil 
and you will become so bitter 
and enraged that you will curse 
inwardly and leave in a huff!!!! 
(Wuss.)”
Instead of going to all that 
trouble to avoid the dire conse­
quences that computer reserva­
tions commonly bring, I think 
that the same rules that apply 
to hotel and airline reservations 
should apply to computer ones. 
When the offending geek ap­
proaches, insisting that he’s got 
a given workstation reserved, 
the user can simply punch a few 
keys, glance at the screen, and 
reply calmly: “I’m sorry, sir. Your 
reservation isn’t showing up. 
Please proceed to our hospital­
ity desk and we’ll try to squeeze 
you on at a later time.”
My only stipulationis that the 
hospitality desk be located in 
Scandinavia.

useless excuses. It could have 
easily been forwarded to a ref­
erendum since the elections 
were so close.
One could simply add the ref­
erendum question to the bot­
tom of the ballots. Addition­
ally, it would appear more ef­
fective. Think to yourself: 
Which would you view as more 
powerful, a resolution passed 
by Senate and then criticized 
by students, or a referendum 
passed by the students them­
selves?
Truthfully, things could have 
been handled a lot better. Even 
some Senators admit that we 
need to clarify misconceptions. 
If the Senate had taken its time, 
many potential problems could 
have been avoided.
We wouldn’t be worrying 
about participation in activi­
ties.
We wouldn’t be asking if Fi­
nancial Aid has to replace all 
aid. (It does not, by the way. It 
need only replace need.)
We wouldn’t be asking 
whether or not the Senators
are working for us, or merely 
carrying out “political shock 
tactics” on behalf of certain 
people or groups. And we 
wouldn’t be saying, “How come 
we were not told?”
Although I disagree with 
what Student Senate did and 
the manner in which it con­
ducted itself, I must applaud 
Altmann and Tomblyn for 
quickly tackling the contro- 
versythathasdeveloped. They 
are preparing a new press re­
lease and are willing to listen 
to concerns about the wording 
of the resolution.
I urge everyone concerned, 
(both pro- and anti-resolution) 
to come to the next Student 
Senate meeting.
It will be held Tuesday, No­
vember 19, at 7 pm in the 
Wherrett Room.
Make yourself heard. The 
Senators are there to hearyou, 
as they always have been, and 
you should use that to your 
advantage.

Tartans crush Case, 43-0
PRESS PASS
by Jason McDonald
Get Case, Hopkins in or out
With the basketball season 
bearing down on us, I feel 
compelled to touch on one of 
the bigger problems that faces 
CMU, and the University 
Athletic Association as a 
whole. No, it’s not a plea to 
make the home uniforms of 
the CMU men’s team gray, too. 
It's Case Western and Johns 
Hopkins.
The problem is this — Case 
and JHU only play half­
schedules in the University 
Athletic Association. Instead 
of playing each team twice, 
they only play each team once. 
This may not seem like a 
problem at first, but add in the 
context that neither team is 
eligible for the UAA title.
This basically means that 
neither team can win the 
Association title, but they can 
spoil the chances of one or 
more of the seven other teams. 
Tve got a problem with this, 
and I imagine other people 
involved in the basketball 
programs do as well. These 
games are just wins or losses 
to Case and Hopkins, but to 
the rest of the teams, they can 
make or break a season.
For example, if the CMU 
women had dropped their 
le against Hopkins, the 
UAA crown may have gone to 
Washington University.
Without the automatic playoff 
berth that goes with the 
Association title, the Tartans 
may have stayed home when 
the Division III equivalent of 
March Madness rolled around. 
In the light of the arbitrary 
shafting the football team just 
took at the hands of the playoff 
committee, that’s a big danger 
sr any team.
One might suggest that 
CMU did well against Hopkins 
and Case last season, so we 
should take the wins and look 
the other way. Well, this isn’t 
just about CMU; for once I’m 
wiling to stick up for our UAA 
cohorts. Unless Case and 
Hopkins both go 0-8 (or 8-0) 
against the UAA, it fundamen­
tally alters the face of the 
conference title race. Besides, 
CMU may be on the other end 
of the spectrum, losing those 
ies a few seasons down the road.
There are two solutions to 
this problem. The desirable 
solution would be for Case and 
Hopkins to play full UAA 
schedules. Unfortunately, this 
one isn’t likely, since it would 
mean tying up eight more 
games with UAA opponents. 
Hopkins, in fact, is already 
tied to the Middle Atlantic 
Conference. I believe Case is 
*0 tied down, but I can’t 
Qame the conference.
This leaves the simpler, 
though less desirable, solution. 
Don't tount games against 
Hopkins and Case toward the 
^termination of the UAA 
mpion. Part of the thing 
out conference play is that 
y°u get a second chance at 
eaf* team. A team doesn’t get 
a chance to make adjustments, 
or account for that fluke win,
H1011 Paying Case or 
°pkins. The UAA would be a 
Mrer race without them.

You could see it coming, but 
there was no way to prevent it 
from happening. The Tartan 
football team, after pounding 
Case Western Reserve Univer­
sity on Saturday 43-0 to finish 
off an impressive 9-1 season, 
was snubbed in the final Divi­
sion III South region rankings.
There will be no post-season 
play for the Tartans, who were 
ranked fifth going into 
Saturday’s contest. The top four 
teams in each region move on to 
the playoffs. The Tartans knew 
they had to win big against Case 
if they hoped to impress the 
South region ranking commit­
tee and move up in the polls.
But even a convincing 43-0 
victory was not enough to con­
vince the committee, not when 
Lycoming (10-0), Dickinson (10- 
0), and Susquehanna (9-1) also 
won this weekend to preserve 
their positions as one, two, and 
four respectively. Washington & 
Jefferson, the number three 
team at 8-1, was idle.
South region playoff pairings
— announced yesterday after­
noon — have #3 W&J at #1 
Lycoming, and #4 Susquehanna 
at #2 Dickinson. Lycoming 
should be paired with 
Susquehanna, butthe two teams 
played two weeks ago, and the 
committee tries to avoid 
rematches whenever possible. 
Had the Tartans captured the 
fourth spot, they would have had 
a chance to avenge last year’s 
17-7 loss to Lycoming in the 
first round of the playoffs.
Instead, the Presidents, who 
many feel do not deserve the 
third-place ranking, will face
Ignatius Sasmita/Tartan Contributing Editor 
Junior linebacker Jim Cooke (85) ties up Case Western’s Chad Blunt. The Tartan defense held the Spartans to 105 total yards.
Lycoming this Saturday. The 
Tartans’ “fall from grace” was 
supposedly not a reflection of 
their strength as a team; rather, 
the committee’s stance has con­
sistently been that the Tartans 
don’t play enough South region 
teams to warrant a higher re­
gional ranking.
So even though the Tartans’ 
only loss was to defending na­
tional champion Allegheny while 
W&J lost to Rochester—a team 
Carnegie Mellon beat — and 
Susquehanna lost to Lycoming 
— a team ranked below Allegh­
eny — their season is over.
“But we have nothing to hang 
our heads about,” said senior 
defensive back Jeff Palaima. 
“We did what we had to do and 
if they don’t want us, that’s their 
problem.”
The Tartans went out with
dignity and grace, showing tre­
mendous promise for the future. 
The win against Case was their 
finest overall performance of the 
season. “I think we’ve finally 
come together as a football 
team,” said sophomore defen­
sive lineman Jon Hutchison. 
“Coach Lackner told us we 
needed to play sixty minutes of 
great football and we did.”
“It seems like for the first time, 
from the opening kickoff, the 
offense and the defense really 
played well,” added senior half­
back Drew Pizzurro.
The Tartans got the upper 
hand midway through the first 
quarter. Freshman quarterback 
Chris Dee connected with sopho­
more tight end Scott Peters on a 
42-yard touchdown pass to give 
the Tartans a 7-0 lead and all 
the points they needed to win.
Women swimmers set 
personal bests against 
John Carroll University
"One more per­
son would have 
won this meet for 
us.”
— Jim Cutrone, 
head swim coach
By DARYL DAVIS
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon swim teams faced off 
against John Carroll University on Saturday 
in a tightly contested meet. The men’s team 
outlastedJohnCarrolltogain 
their second victory of the 
season by a score of 110-95.
The women’s team fought 
through a see-sawmatchthat 
was decided by the final relay 
race; unfortunately for the 
Tartans, -John Carroll came 
out on top, 104-101.
The final score of the 
women’s meet does not re- 
flect the personal accomplish­
ments ofthe team. Freshmen 
Joanne Klevannoted, “Many 
ofusswamourpersonalbests SmSBSBmmm 
so far this year.” These ef­
forts included two team members who had 
triple first place finishes. Sophomore Denise 
Fenwick captured first place in the 50-yard 
freestyle (26.5 seconds), the 500-yard freestyle 
(5:35.37), and the 100-yard breast stroke 
(1:13.77). Fenwick’s time in the breast stroke 
was a new pool record at CMU.
Senior Glynis Frost also scored triple blue 
ribbons. She swam the 200-yard freestyle in 
2:09.42, the 200-yard individual medley in 
2:25.26 and the 100-yard back stroke in 1:08.38 
for her first-place finishes.
Team members who achieved career per­
sonal bests in this meet included junior Meryem 
Tangoren, senior Heather Wasilowski, and 
freshman Dianne Keen. Tangoren’s times of 
2:14.66 in the 200-yard freestyle and 1:17.78 
in the 100-yard breast stroke earned her two 
second-place finishes as well as personal bests. 
Wasilonski swam a 1:14.69 in the 100-yard 
backstroke and a 1:02.05 in the 100-yard 
freestyle; Keen finished the 100-yard freestyle 
with a time of1:05.97.
The women’s match had gone back and forth 
right up to the final race, with the Tartans 
holding a slight edge going in. Once again it 
was the lack of numbers that caused the team 
problems. Coach Jim Cutrone said, “We’re 
still looking for anyone wanting to join the 
women’s team. One more per- 
son would have won this meet 
for us.”
The men’s team does not 
share the lack of numbers of 
the women’s team, and were 
able to gain an early lead in 
their match-up with John 
Carroll. Although it remained^ 
a tight competition, John 
Carroll could not catch up.
Senior Brian Zimmerman 
was a strong contributing fac­
tor to the win with his triple 
first place finishes. He swam 
a 10:28.36 in the 1,000-yard 
freestyle, a 1:51.00 in the 200-yard freestyle, 
and a 5:11.31 in the 500-yard freestyle to earn 
his three victories. He showed incredible 
stamina, as his 1000-yard race and his 200- 
yard race were back-to-back, with only about 
five minutes of rest in between.
Sophomore Todd Vandall and freshman 
Jason Burkey combined their talents in the 
sprinting events to further secure CMUs win. 
Vandall won the 100-yard freestyle with a 
time of 51.89 seconds and Burkey captured a 
first place in the 50-yard freestyle with a time 
of 22.3 seconds. They both then went on to 
compete in CMUs first place finish in the 400- 
yard relay with Vandall swimming a 50.4 in 
his 100-yard leg and Burkey swimming an 
impressive 49.10 in his leadoff leg.
Tomorrow night, the Tartans host 
Westminster College at 6 pm, before travel­
ling to Case Western Reserve University on 
Saturday. The final swim match of the fall 
semesterwill be the UAA Invitational atRoch- 
ester, which will be held December 6-7.
Peters made a spectacular fin­
gertip grab after breaking away 
from two defenders. “I was just 
lucky to catch it because I was 
supposed to run a hook pattern,” 
said Peters. “But I saw that no 
one was there and I kept going 
straight down the field. Chris 
threwitrightthere, andwescored 
and it started the avalanche.”
Case was unable to move the 
ball against a fired-up Tartan 
defense. The Spartans didn’t 
pick up a first down until the 
10:25 mark in the second quar­
ter, when tailback Jarvis Gibson 
broke away for 43 yards on sec­
ond and nine. Gibson’s run was 
the Spartans’ only first down of 
the half, and accounted for most 
of Case’s total offensive produc­
tion in the first half.
The Tartans broke open the
7-0 game, exploding for four
touchdowns in the second quar­
ter. Pizzurro scampered for a 
four-yard TD with just 1:48 
elapsed. The score was set up by 
sophomore cornerback Jerry : 
Fuller’s recovery of a Gibson 
fumble, which gave the Tartans-,,, 
possession at the Case 16. un.
Less than three minutes later,or 
the Tartans struck again. This,,.. 
time Pizzurro took it in from. 
three yards out to widen the 
lead to 21-0. The key play of the 
drive was a 46-yard flea-flicker 
from Dee to sophomore receiver 
Jarrod Siket.
“We called it because we had. 
good field position after a bad,, 
punt and we figured we could 
try to unravel them a bit by.. 
calling a trick play,” said Siket. 
“Chris did a good job on the read 
and just laid it up.”

CMU hockey 
blasts IUP, 9-3
By DAVE MARTIN
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Univer­
sity hockey team took to the ice 
at Neville Skate Rink against 
rival Indiana University ofPenn- 
sylvania Saturday. Expecting a 
tough game, the CMU club was 
pleasantly surprised to find the 
IUP goalie full of holes and the 
IUP team very slow defensively. 
The Tartans were defensively 
dominant and presented IUP 
with a show on ice, winning eas­
ily 9-3.
Senior left winger George 
Mueller commented after the 
game, “We just played solid 
hockey. We didn’t have many 
penalties, andit wasn’t as physi­
cal a game as it could have been.”
Only 1:22 into the game, 
graduate student Chris Keim 
picked up the puck at center ice 
after an IUP pass went awry 
and skated to the goal, sending 
the IUP goalie spinning as Keim 
buried the puck in the net. It 
was suddenly obvious that CMU 
came to play, despite being shy 
some key players.
The game went back and forth, 
each team taking a few shots on 
goal until IUP tied the game at 
7:34 in the first period. Not a 
minute later, eight seconds into 
a CMU power play, senior Adam 
Duncan fed the puck to a ready 
and waiting Keim, who planted 
the puck in the net. Keim was 
well on his way to one of two hat 
tricks to be turned by CMU play­
ers.
The second player to do so, 
graduate student Erik Galis, 
started by scoring unassisted 
with 3:55 left in the period. With 
a minute to go and the score 3- 
1, freshman Phil Beck got the 
puck to senior Ed Kilduff, who
scored the fourth CMU goal of n 
the period.
The second period showed . 
much of the same for IUP, who 
was noticeably slow on the ice 
all afternoon. Galis extended the^. 
score to 5-1 with the assist from' ' 
Kilduff atl5:53inthel7 minute 
period. IUP found a way past 
the CMU goalie, graduate stu­
dent Scott Berry, just over a 
minute later, to close to 5—2.
The teams skated the ice for a 
while, neither team able to find 
the opportunity to score until 
Keim went to the goal off the 
pass from graduate student 
Mike Gallin to score his third 
goal of the game and lengthen 
the lead to 6-2.
As in the previous two peri­
ods, CMU continued to domi­
nate defensively and offensively. 
But IUP, hoping for a miracu­
lous comeback, scored first at 
13:55, shortening the CMU lead 
to three.
IUP’s hopes were quickly shot 
down, though, when freshman 
Blair Echols passed the puck to 
senior George Mueller, who sent* 
the goalie reaching for the sky. 
At 6:55 Galis scored his third 
goal with another Kilduff assist 
against an IUP goalie who had 
been injured making a save on a 
previous shot. He stayed in, but 
allowed Galis’ goal as well as an 
unassisted slap shot from fresh­
man P. J. Mann with 3:39 to play 
in the game, finishing the day’s 
scoring.
Keim noted the goalie’s per­
formance, “Scott [Berry] made 
some great saves for us. We 
played a lot more disciplined this 
game.” Kilduff, one of a trio of 
captains, said, “We stuck to our 
game plan and stayed out of the 
[penalty] box. As long as we stick 
to that, we’ll keep winning.”

FOOTBALL, from page 9
The Tartans, who controlled the ball
i incredible 20 minutes during the 
first two quarters, scored their next 
¡two touchdowns inside the two-minute 
mark of the first half.
Senior halfback Greg Marmol (85 
¡yards on 11 carries) finished off an 
eight-play, 74-yard drive with a seven- 
yard TD. Case hurt itself on the drive, 
with defensive pass interference and 
personal foul penalties on the same 
¦play, resulting in a 29-yard mark-off 
'and a first down for the Tartans at the 
;Case 39.
Then, with 43 seconds left, Pizzurro 
¡scored his third touchdown of the game 
¡on a six-yard pass from Dee, to make 
the score 35-0. Again, a Spartan mis­
take resulted in Tartan points. On the 
Jdckoff following Marmol’s touchdown, 
thad Blunt fumbled, and sophomore 
:JeffBlue recovered at the Case 33.

Senior halfback Drew Pizzurro scored three touchdowns In his final game as a Tartan.
Ramsey was 8 of 23 for 41 yards, and 
threw two interceptions. “Ramsey 
must’ve gotten up on the wrong side of 
the bed,” said Palaima. “He didn’t have 
a good day. He was throwing out of 
bounds and short, and he wasn’t hit­
ting his receivers.
Meanwhile Dee hadhis best day as a 
Tartan, completing 9 of his 11 passes 
for a season-high 238 yards and two 
touchdowns. Siket led all receivers with 
two catches for 68 yards; Peters caught 
two passes for 57 yards.
“The line held up their blocks, the 
receivers got open, and luckily I was 
throwing the ball well today,” said Dee. 
“I felt I had something to prove because 
I kind of didn’t show up the last three 
games. Today I made my presence 
known and I like to think I helped the 
team get where we need to be.”
The offense rounded out its scoring in 
the third quarter. Junior halfback Grif­
fin Pero (17 carries, 93 yards) darted in 
from one yard out, finishing off a 13-

play, 52-yard drive. Fred Harding, who 
had connected on four previous extra 
points, missed wide left, and the Tar­
tans led 41-0 with 2:28 left in the third 
quarter.
The drive was exemplary of how bal­
anced the Tartan offense was against 
the Spartans. Dee completed passes of 
15, 13, and 22 yards to Peters (tight 
end), Pero (fullback), and Siket (re­
ceiver) respectively before Pero’s touch­
down. On the day, wide receivers ac­
counted for four receptions; running 
backs, four; and tight ends, two.
“Once one person gets a catch, the 
defense will key on that person and 
another person can get open,” said Pe­
ters. “That’s what happened and Chris 
just hit everyone.”
The special teams unit came up with 
a big play of its own late in the fourth
quarter. With Case trapped deep in its 
own end, sophomore Ben Burton 
blocked a ChuckThall punt, which Case 
fullback Rusty Delffs recovered in his 
own end zone. Delffs was then tackled 
for a safety.
The Tartans’ 43 points matched their 
second-highest point total this year. 
They scored a season-high 55 points 
against the College of Wooster, and 43 
against Grove City. But the win over 
Case was their largest margin of vic­
tory, not to mention their second shut­
out of the season—the other coming 
against Chicago.
“This was probably one of the two 
best defensive games we’ve played the 
last two years,” said linebacker Mike 
Hession. “We knew coming in that we 
didn’t want to give up more than two 
touchdowns. But you always shoot for
the shutout every game you play and to 
get it, for a defense, is great.”
The win against Case, although it 
didn’t earn the Tartans a playoff berth, 
did clinch the University Athletic Asso­
ciation championship. This is the sec­
ond consecutive UAA title for the Tar­
tans, who remain undefeated against 
UAA teams the past two seasons. If the 
Spartans had prevailed, there would 
have been a three-way tie for the UAA 
crown between Carnegie Mellon, Case, 
and the University of Rochester.
While a UAA title is little consolation 
for not making the playoffs, the Tar­
tans do have a lot to be proud of; their 
combined 19-2 record over the last two 
seasons has helped establish CMU as 
one of the teams to beat in Division III. 
They should be better than ever next 
year.

Bills should clinch AFC 
East title this weekend
Tis the season for playoff pre­
dictions, but I think I’m going to 
forego that this week and handle 
it in next week’s column, seeing 
as it’s the last issue of the se­
mester. I will make a rather 
brash prediction, though. The 
National Football League’s best 
team this year will have a loss. 
The Washington Redskins 
(Phil’s Team) will lose a regular 
season game somewhere along 
the line. But don’t expect them 
to lose a post-season game. Phil’s 
Team isn’t undefeated at this 
point for nothing. They will be 
NFL champs when it’s all said 
and done. Now, for my normal 
slate of predictions.
Tonight’s game should prove 
to be a division clincher for the 
Buffalo Bills as they take on the 
Miami Dolphins at Joe Robbie 
Stadium. The Bills are looking 
to take the AFC East for the 
third year in a row. Little stands 
between them and that third 
division championship, except, 
of course, Miami. The Dolphins 
will give the Bills a scare, for 
three quarters at least. Bills 38, 
Dolphins 31.

this wasn’t the game I had in

will have to drop one game be­
fore the playoffs or they may not 
make it to the Super Bowl. (Hu­
mility is an important virtue, 
and it must be learned some­
time.) I really doubt this to be

In the weakAFC Central Sun­
day the Houston Oilers will se­
cure the division with an easy

The only thing the Steelers will

make much difference against 
the overpowering Oilers (pos­

1991-92 Basketball Preview
Women prepare for UAA title defense
Sam Greenfield/Tartan Photographer
Another strong season from sophomore forward Jeanine Megahan (with ball), who earned all-UAA honors 
as a freshman, will be one of many keys to a successful season for the Tartans.
¿Senior leadership from players like center Amy Buxbaum may pave the way to another UAA championship 
'and a possible return to the NCAA playoffs.
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Sports Editor
It’s time for a little sports 
math. Take a twenty-win bas­
ketball team that won its con­
ference and went to the NCAA 
: playoffs. Subtract a few players; 
add a new class of freshmen. Do 
some adjusting for experience, 
: make a few final calculations for 
: injuries, and what do you have?
The answer is, of course, the 
-'1991-92 Carnegie Mellon 
women’s basketball team. The 
¦. returning squad that rolled to a 
21-5 regular season mark be­
fore bowing out of the NCAA
Division III national playoffs in 
the opening round is back, but 
it’s going to take game action to 
tell how this year’s squad com­
pares to last year’s team.
“On paper, you can be any­
thing you want to be,” said head 
coach Gerri Seidl, who brings an 
87-77 record into her eighth sea­
son as coach, “but we’ll have to 
see how we do on the court be­
fore we can really judge where 
we stand.”
After last season, the Tartans 
have learned not to worry too 
much about preseason expecta­
tions. Going into last season, 
the Tartans were more con­
cerned with how they were go­
ing to reach .500 than they were 
with winning the University 
Athletic Asociation title and go­
ing to the playoffs. However, a 
nine-game winning streak cata­
pulted the team into a first-place 
tie coming back from winter 
break.
Despite the strong start, the 
drive for the UAA title didn’t 
begin in earnest until January 20 in St. Louis, when the Tar­
tans overcame a 17-point half- 
time deficit against the Wash­
ington University Bears, who 
were ranked fourth in the na­
tion. Then-junior guard Heather
O’Donnell hit the game-winning 
basket with one second on the 
clock.
From there, the Tartans never 
looked back, going 7—3 down the 
stretch. Despite an upset loss at 
the hands of the Emory Eagles, 
CMU clinched a tie for the UAA 
crown with a 57-54 road win 
against Brandeis University, 
and won the title outright in the 
season finale at home against 
Rochester. Unfortunately, the 
Tartans fell out of the NCAA 
playoffs in the first round, los­
ing to Susquehanna University, 70-54.
The outlook for this year’s 
team is a good one, as the Tar­
tans return nine letterwinners 
(although junior guard Kelly 
Sterling will be out of the lineup 
with mononucleosis, at least 
through the winter break). A 
quartet of seniors and an all-UAA should provide plenty of competition

^Preseason polls are a very hit- 
or-miss business. The same 
people that picked Washington 
University to upset the Univer­
sity of Rochester for the Univer­
sity Athletic Association men’s 
title probably had the CMU 
‘women picked for third or fourth 
l&st season. Despite their 
‘Streaky nature, looking at the 
t¥ams in the race can give some 
valuable insight as to who’s go­
ing to be in the top spot at the 
end of the year. With that in 
^nind, let’s take a loQk at the 
•UAA polls, with a few extra­
curricular comments thrown in. -m
THE MEN’S POLL
.The University of Roches­ter (23-7 overall, 11-3 in the 
UAA last season) was an almost 
unanimous pick to return to the 
top spot after losing it to Wash­
ington last year •— eight of the 
nine first-place votes went to 
;the Yellowjackets. Even though 
Rochester lost three starters 
from last year’s squad, they’ll 
stay strong with nine 
letterwinners returning. Be­
sides, one of the two returning 
starters is 6’8” all-everything 
center Chris Fite (20.4 points 
per game, 10.2 rebounds per 
game), a player that could easily 
cany the Yellowjackets while 
.the new starters get their feet 
wet.
BrandeisUniversity(17-10,
8-6) returns three of five start­
ers — forward Andre James, 
center David Brooks, and guard 
Steve Harrington. James and 
Brooks were all-UAA selections 
last season. The Judges will also 
be bolstered by the return of
junior guards Adam Machala 
and Paul Favours, who sat out 
last season. Second seems overly 
optimistic, though.
If you’re looking for a dark 
horse conference champion, New York University (16-10, 
8-6) is the team for you. The 
Violets return all five starters, 
and a total of eleven letterwin­
ners. The Killer C’s — Rob Ca­
pers, Larry Costa, and Adam 
Crawford — and second team 
all-UAA guard Roosevelt Smith 
will be the key performers. 
Strong seasons from these play­
ers will keep NYU in the race 
down to the wire.
Why are the defending UAA 
champs, the Bears of Washing­
ton University (19-9, 12-2)
picked to only finish fourth this 
season? Well, you lose four start­
ers and these things happen to 
you. Junior forward Charlie 
Borsheim (15.2 ppg) will be the 
foundation of this year’s Bears 
squad, but the inexperience of 
the remainder of the team makes 
fourth place a dangerously opti­
mistic prediction.
Fifth place is a tie between 
Carnegie Mellon University 
(12—13, 3—11) and Case West­
ern Reserve University (9- 
13, 4—4). Case is a one-trick 
puppy, relying on all-UAA guard 
Ed Saxon to carry the team. 
CMU carries a guard-heavy ros­
ter (the inside game was one of 
the Tartans’ biggest problems 
last season), but should be com-
UAA sophomore certainly aren’t 
a bad starting point for the Tar­
tans’ UAA title defense.
The seniors—guards Bridget 
Eperthener, Katie Fahey, and 
Heather O’Donnell, and center 
Amy Buxbaum — all bring im­
pressive credentials into this 
season. Buxbaum, a second- 
team all-UAA performer, aver­
aged 11.8 points a game, and 
pulled down a team-leadingll .3 
rebounds; O’Donnell scored 8.9 
points a game, and was second 
on the team with 82 assists. 
Fahey scored an even 11 points 
per game before suffering a sea­
son-ending knee injury at Chi­
cago, atwhich point Eperthener 
rose to the challenge of filling 
the gap created by Fahey’s ab­
sence.
Then there’s the aforemen­
tioned sophomore, forward 
Jeanine Megahan, and the ail­
ing Sterling. Megahan led the 
Tartans in scoring with 14.9 
points per game (on a team-high 
49 percent shooting accuracy), 
and was second on the Tartans 
with 7.6 rebounds per contest. 
Megahan’s efforts earned her 
first-team all-UAAhonors. Ster­
ling, who played guard and for­
ward last season, averaged 8.3 
points and led the Tartans with 
94 assists. Sterling’s return (no 
date is guaranteed) should pro­
vide the team with a pleasant 
mid-season boost.
Rounding out the returning 
veterans will be sophomores 
Mary Moore, Trish Henrich, and 
Diane Jakubiak. Moore got the 
most playing time of the three 
last season (11.2 minutes per 
game), while Henrich and 
Jakubiak didn’t really get 
enough playing time to get an

If you listen carefully, you can

half-member, Johns Hopkins University (17-7, 5-3), gradu­

1991-92 Basketball Preview
Wingen sets sights 
on winning record
Sophomore Derek Dragislch, last year’s leading scorer and rebounder, will be called 
on to play a major role in the Tartan rejuvenation.
By CHRIS CENKNER
Tartan Staffuiriter
The 1991-92 Carnegie Mellon men’s 
basketball team will have a lot of people 
looking in its direction. Last season, 
under first-year head coach Tony 
Wingen, expectations were very low. 
Surprisingly, the team compiled a 9-15 
record, a marked improvement over 
their 1989-90 record of 4-21. Beyond 
just gaining more wins, the team has a 
new attitude, thanks to Wingen.
“Our program stresses enthusiasm 
and aggressiveness,” said Wingen. 
“We’ve laid the base for that program, 
and we’re going to continue doing so. 
We’re going to be real exciting to watch. 
We’ll use our full-court defense and a 
fast break offense, along with a more 
efficient half-court defense,"
One advantage the Tartans have is 
that they have a young squad, which 
will aid Wingen in installing his pro­
gram, since all the Tartan players will 
be here for at least two more seasons. 
The only senior would have been guard 
Phil Bronner, but the oft-injured 
Bronner will not be in uniform this 
season. In fact, there are only two jun­
iors on the squad, guards Chris Benec 
and Todd Jenkins. They are the Tar­
tans’ co-captains this season, and 
Wingen looks for them to be leaders for 
the squad. “We wanted to improve our 
team’s strength,” said Wingen. “Chris 
and Todd came in this year in superior 
condition, and they’ve been models for 
the whole team.”
The two players that will help set 
Wingen’s program the most will be the 
team’s high scorers, sophomores Derek 
Dragisich and Michael Hosni. 
Dragisich, the Tartans’ starting cen­
ter, was a second-team all UAA selec­
tion last season. Hosni is a consistent 
scorer and is the team’s best all around 
player.
Sophomore Matt Reiprish, the Tar­
tans’ leading three-point shooter, will 
definitely aid in Wingen’s high-octane 
style of play — Reiprish played both 
guard and forward for the Tartans last 
year. Sophomore Steve Rennekamp, a 
6'5" forward, is coming off a strong 
preseason, andalongwith fellow sopho­
more Brad Lawrence (6'5”), will im­
prove on the inside game — a major 
weakness in last year’s team as the 
Tartans were out-rebounded by an av­
erage of 5.3 boards per game. Sopho­
more Charlie Connors (6'7") will also 
help, provided he recovers from 
arthroscopic knee surgery; Wingen 
hopes Connors will be back next semes­
ter.
Guards Dane Mathews and Rony 
Johns, both sophomores, are explosive 
offensive players who have boosted their 
defensive play tremendously. Fresh­
men Dwayne Coleman and Andy 
Rentschler will also aid in the Tartans’ 
cause.
Wingen is excited about the team’s 
chances in the UAA race. “This is the 
best Division III conference in the coun­
try,” he said. “I see Rochester as thé 
team to beat, with Brandeis and NYU 
to be challenges as well. I see us im­
proving our road record, improving our 
competitiveness, and being in the 
middle of the pack this season. A win­
ning record is a very realistic goal for 
us.”
The Tartans will begin their season 
this weekend with the Carnegie Mellon 
Classic. The four-team tournament will 
feature CMU, Trinity, Colorado, and 
Rhodes Colleges. Games on both days 
will be at 1 and 3 pm.Rochester, Washington picked to grab UAA crowns
UAA, from page 12
guard Matt Krapf, a career
1,000-pointer, has a lock on one 
starting spot, but the other four 
positions are in disarray. They 
have some solid players, but 
Cunningham will have to work 
some severe magic to get the 
program in working order.
Oh, how the mighty have 
fallen! The Eagles of Emory University (10-16, 5—9) were 
UAA champs two years ago, but 
are slated for last this season 
(four of oine last-place votes). 
Ten returning letterwinners in­
dicates — at least to me — that
things aren’t quite as bad as 
they appear down in Dixie.
THE WOMEN’S POLL
Surprise, surprise! Washing­ton University (24—7,11-3) is 
picked to win the women’s race 
again this season. Despite los­
ing Karen Hermann (Wash­
ington’s all-time leading scorer 
and rebounder), the Bears will 
be tough, with four starters and 
15 letterwinners returning. Ad­
mittedly, having a JV program 
helps, giving the younger play­
ers experience that other teams’

younger players don’t have.
Was it done with mirrors? Carnegie Mellon University 
(21-6,12-2) took the UAA title 
last season to just about 
everyone’s surprise. Despite 
having an almost intact roster, 
they’re slated for second this 
year. Go figure. For an in-depth 
look, see the preview article on 
the facing page.New York University (19- 
8,8-6) is the quiet success story 
of the UAA. They only finished 
fourth in the UAA last season, 
but they compiled an overall 
record good enough to go to the 
NCAA playoffs. Despite losing 
an all-UAA starter (Jocelyn 
Katsock), the Violets seem solid, 
with eight returning letterwin­
ners. Look for them to cause a 
lot of teams a lot of problems.
Injuries were the theme for 
the University of Chicago(14-
11, 6-8) last season. Key per­
formers Kristin Maschka, 
Allison Heyne, and Heather 
Gammel all spent time on the 
shelf with injuries. The net re­
sult (no pun intended, honestly) 
was a seven-game drop from the 
school-record 21-4 season in 1989-90. With 12 letterwinners 
back, a healthy Maroon team 
could have a shot at the UAA 
crown.Johns Hopkins (17-7, 5-3) 
is best suited to be a spoiler for
The University of Rochester will once again be the team to beat in the men’s basketball race.
other UAA teams. Since they 
only play a half-schedule in the 
UAA, prefering the Middle At­
lantic Conference, the best they 
can really do is throw a wrench 
in the plans of the tougher UAA 
teams. Is this fair? Probably not. 
Can it happen? Nah. The Jays 
graduated too many key players 
to be a major concern.
Brandeis University (18-9,
8-6) is singing the same song as 
a lot of UAA teams —¦ three 
starters, eight letterwinners. 
They’ll still have center Racheal 
Perry, which is a good starting
point, and the bench depth 
should make up pretty well for 
the loss of two starters. Unfortu­
nately, I’ll only take them seri­
ously when they stop calling us 
the Cahnegie Mellon Tahtans.
The University of Roches­ter (6-19, 3-11) has two start­
ers and a load of bench players 
and freshmen. Sounds like 
trouble.
Emory University (7-15, 3- 
11) is one of the most under­
rated programs in the league, 
according to CMU coach Gerri 
Seidl. The Eagles did upset the
Tartans, 66-65, last season, bftt 
they’re changing personnel and 
on-court philosophy. A fast- 
break offense isn’t the sort of 
thing you just jump into, even 
with experienced players. -It 
could be a long season for the 
Eagles, who lack any senior lead­
ership (or any seniors at all).,.
Case Western (3-19,1-7), is 
the one UAA school that most 
coaches agree on (seven of nine

Tartans face tough challenge in quest 
to repeat as conference champs
WOMEN’S BB, from page 12
accurate reading of their ability.
The Tartan game plan won’t 
differ much from the formula 
that took them so far last year. 
“I’d like to have a running, press­
ing game, so we’re going to try to 
maintain that,” said Seidl. “It’s 
better to have experienced 
people, because that style re­
quires you to make decisions 
quickly. We’re going to have to 
push the younger kids to make 
those decisions, and we’re going 
to have to move some people 
around to make the best use of 
our personnel.”
The four seniors will be called 
on heavily to lead the team this 
season, and, from what she’s 
seen so far, Seidl feels they’re up 
to the challenge. “They want to 
win so badly,” she said. “They’ve 
really come in and set the tone, 
and I like the tone we’re setting.
They’ve got a strong work ethic 
and a great attitude, and it’s 
penetrating down through the 
rest of the team.”
The Tartans haven’t been hurt 
too severely in terms of num­
bers, losing only two players in 
the off-season — guard Lynn 
Truskie graduated, and forward 
Chandra Buist did not return to 
school this fall. The numbers 
say that the Tartans can get by 
without the pair (Truskie’s loss 
was expected; increased playing 
time for sophomore forward 
Mary Moore and the freshmen 
should cover for the hole left by 
Buist’s absence), but the experi­
ence of the two players will be 
missed.
“People might say You only 
lost two players,’ but they were 
two upperclassmen that had a 
lot of experience,” said Seidl. 
“Without them, we have four
sophomores and four freshmen, 
and the chemistry of our team is 
almost completely different.” 
Finally, there are the new 
freshmen in the Tartan lineup. 
Forward Stephanie Peck, cen­
ter Meredith McKnight, and for­
ward/guards Christa Sober and 
Jennifer Gretz bring “a lot of 
raw talent” to this year’s team.
“They just need college expe­
rience,” said Seidl. “They also 
need to work harder in terms of 
energy and learn to take that 
extra step, but I think the se­
niors are already beginning to 
teach them that.”
Seidl’s goals for the team are 
very clear-cut. “Obviously, we 
want to win our conference; 
that’s why were playing in the 
first place,” she said. “I’d like us 
to get back to the playoffs again, 
but that’s not- a primary goal. 
You can’t really make a state­
ment like that until you play 
some games and see how gobd 
you are.”
The conference should be-a 
hard-fought race again this sea­
son; Seidl sees New York Uni­
versity, Washington University 
(which won the preseason 
coaches’ poll by one vote over 
CMU), and the University 'of 
Chicago as the major compete 
tors. Atlanta’s Emory Univer­
sity should also be “stronger than 
most people think. They’ve got a 
nice program.”
The season opens this week­
end, as the Tartans travel to the 
Franklin and Marshall Tourna­
ment. In addition to CMU and 
F&M, the tournament will fea­
ture Misericordia and Wilkes 
Colleges. The first home game of 
the season will be on November 
26 against Case Western Re­
serve University.

& ALIM RAY
Tartan Acting Features Editor
In the basement of Skibo Hall, 
student organizations store in 
their offices valuables ranging 
from paint to money. Each of 
these organizations, funded by 
the Student Activities fee, ful­
fills some needs of the student 
body and relies on these valu­
ables to accomplish its duties. 
Several thefts have occurred in 
in recent years, including 
the thefts of two computers last 
week The Student Union, $400 
from the Alpa Phi Omega last 
semester, and The Thistle's com­
puters a year and a half ago.
The problem is not that the 
University does not offer enough 
protection, but in that the orga­
nizations do not always take full­
est advantage of this protection. 
Doors and windows are left care­
lessly unsecured.
Bonnie Gorman, the assistant 
director of Student Activities 
¡aid, “With all the thefts that 
’m aware of there hasn’t been 
forced entry.” Jim LaPaglia, the 
Director of Security at Carnegie 
Mellon, backs up this claim by 
saying that with 95 percent of 
all theft at CMU there is no 
forced entry. He said that it’s 
“not reasonable to depend solely 
Campus Police. [The stu­
dents] are not being realistic. 
^They] are part of the team of 
being safe.”
Gorman also said, “it’s each 
organization’s responsibility” to 
their doors and windows 
locked. Often convenience comes 
before safety, however, and mak­
ing sure that every member al­
ways remembers to lock up is 
not an easy task. A member of A
“We have quite a few controls and 
beats. ...we are around Skibo more 
than once an hour.”
— Jim LaPaglia, 
CMU Director of Securtiy
Phi O admits that he “crawls 
through the window all the time, 
when it’s open,” because it’s 
easier than going through the 
door.
LaPaglia said, “We have quite 
a few controls and beats. ...we 
are around Skibo more than once 
an hour.” Thieves cannot time 
the watches because LaPaglia 
asserts that there is 
unpredictablitiy with the com­
plicated system of patrol cars 
and walking patrols.
The patrols are “different ev­
ery day and on every shift, but 
there’s always overlapping....” 
The officers, however, often can­
not tell who is not supposed to be 
in the building and whether any­
one is acting strangely, because 
so many people are involved with 
the organizations that wide va­
riety of things can go unnoticed. 
The officers do not check within 
offices, but they will lock doors 
and leave notes to the students 
if doors were left unlocked.
The question then arises if too 
many keys exist to the individual 
offices. Each organization con­
trols the number of keys it hasfor 
its members and whether or not 
the Skibo Information Desk 
holds a key.
The only people who will be 
allowed to use the Info Desk key 
are those to whom the organiza­
tion has given a key card with 
the holders name printed on it.
The key card and a student ID 
must be left at the desk when 
the key is borrowed. Some of the 
offices can be accessed with a 
master key for the whole build­
ing, but Gorman and security 
are the only owners of such keys. 
People who maintain the build­
ing have to sign out keys when 
they go about their duties, and 
so it would be easy to discover if 
they stole something. Besides, 
usually it is each organization’s 
responsibility to keep their of­
fices clean.
If there is such a good system 
of locks, and if Security patrols 
regularly, there seems to be no 
explanation for the thefts that 
take place.
Is there a way to make mem­
bers of the student organizations 
more responsible, or is there a 
security system that doesn’t de­
pend on the students? Sugges­
tions have been made: put bars 
on the windows, bolt the win­
dows, install card readers, in­
stall an alarm system, put an­
other set of locks on all of the 
doors, have an awareness meet­
ing with the heads of the organi­
zations.
The problem with the sugges­
tions that require the installa­
tion of new security devices is, 
as Gorman points out, that Skibo 
is soon to be torn down, and the 
expense doesn’t seem to be worth 
it.

attendant must check to see

5r a resident escort. Otherwise, the

: es], but we can’t be there all the 
' me> says Emily Leon, the desk man­
ger for the New dorm. “There haven’t 
en ^any incidents, though, so I feel
we’ve been successful.”
Most desk attendants are relatively 
careful about security. “If a large group 
of students comes in the door at once 
it’s hard to see who gets in, but if I see 
someone I don’t know, I ask for I.D.,” 
says Kate Sukel, a Donner desk atten­
dant. “If they’re acting weird, or I’ve 
never seen them, they’re always 
carded,” said Mayuri Chotu, a desk 
attendant for Morewood A-Tower.
Many students are not aware of secu­
rity precautions besides the locks on 
the main entrances of the residence 
halls or the desk attendants. Housing 
employs a student who checks every 
door in every Housing-owned building, 
on-campus and off, each morning to 
make sure they are functioning prop­
erly. There are security patrols of the 
dorms every night by Campus Police. 
In addition, Director of CMU Security 
Jim Lapaglia conducts a campus watch 
program to try to make students aware 
of unusual occurrences on campus and
to inform Campus Police of them.
“The dorms are as safe as we can 
make it,” says Roslyn Hall, the area 
coordinator for Mudge House. “If we 
have a breakdown in security, it’s some­
thing the students have done. [For 
instance,] they loan keys or I.D.s to 
non-CMU students, they block doors 
with trash cans so they don’t have to 
use keys to get in, they knock screens 
out so they can climb in through the 
window. They don’t perceive it as a 
security risk; they just think of conve­
nience.”
Generally, students living in Hous­
ing-owned facilities feel they are safe. 
“I think this year they’re being more 
careful about checking who comes in,” 
said Leo Scott, a resident of Morewood 
E-Tower apartments. “There’s a bal­
ance between getting in too easily and 
being too restrictive,” states Andy Vaz, 
a Mudge resident. “People can’t get in 
without a key or I.D., so that would 
make it pretty safe.”
Ann Simonton 
speaks about female 
images in media
AMY POTTHAST
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Imagine waking up one morning 
and realizing that every commercial 
on television, every magazine adver­
tisement, and every soap opera were 
all glaringly and unjustifiably in­
sulting to you and degrading to you, 
stereotyping you, showing you as a 
sex object and nothing more. Once, 
you thought you lived every girls1 
dream as a fashion model. But now 
you realize that you were sellingyour 
body for money, only slightly better 
than a legalized, glamorized prosti­
tute.
If you can put yourself in such a 
position, you might begin to under­
stand Ann Simonton, who came to 
Carnegie Mellon last Monday evening 
to give a lecture as a guest of the 
Political Speakers Forum Board. Once 
a high fashion model romping half- 
naked on the cover of Sports 
Illustrated’s swimsuit issue, 
Simonton today is a self-declared 
“radical feminist,” speaking on col­
lege campuses across the nation, and 
founder of an influential women’s ac­
tivist publication Media Watch.
At the age of 14, Ann Simonton 
began her modeling career. Although 
she often felt extremely uncomfort­
able modeling bathing suits and
standing in front of gaping crowd 
during beauty pageants, the money 
and potential for fame enticed her 
onward. Her amazing good fortune in 
such a competitive field almost made 
her feel ungrateful for doubting her 
career.
With each job interview, usually 
consisting of a strip tease in front of 
an audience of male “executives,” 
Simonton’s self-respect dwindled. The 
bombardment of men photographers, 
the insulting sexual harassment, and 
finally, the gang rape committed 
against her at knife point, really be­
gan to take their toll.
Then one day, she snapped. With 
self-esteem at an all-time low, she 
could barely face herself anymore. It 
was at this time, in college, that she 
began to see the world in a different 
light. As with most college students, 
Simonton’s thinking was trans­
formed. In reading philosophy, his­
tory, and literature, she began to no­
tice patterns that had previously been 
invisible to her. Putting two and two 
together, she assayed with much 
shock and relief that all along her 
feelings of awkwardness had been 
justified.
She rocked with the realization that 
all women in the media are made to 
feel like nothing — posted on the

WalkPittsburgh Tour appeals to intellectual side
By SHARI MORGAN
Tartan Staffwriter
How many people have really walked 
around Pittsburgh and noticed and 
admired all of the sites, architecture, 
and culture? Does it seem like there are 
just too many places to go, and just not 
enough time to go and see them all? Bob 
Gangewere, a part-time professor in 
the English Department at CMU, has. 
written WalkPittsburgh, A Walking 
Tour of Downtown Pittsburgh, a bro­
chure designed for people who feel this 
way. It is a self-guided tour of down­
town Pittsburgh, which only takes two 
hours (or more, depending on whether 
you like to shop!) The circular tour 
starts at the David Lawrence Conven­
tion Center and can be joined at any 
point along the tour.
About four years ago, Gangewere was 
asked to write a one hour walking tour 
of Pittsburgh for the Association of 
American Museums conference that 
was meeting in town. Because of the
“Mellon Square is our favorite place because 
from here it is possible see all of Pittsburgh, 
like the PPG Place, and the Frick Building.”

Beehive gives caffeine fix
By BOB DIXON
Tartan Staffwriter
If the party scene has gotten 
old and alcohol has lost its former 
appeal, but a Friday night buzz 
still sounds good, there’s a new 
alternative. It’s the new Bee­
hive, and it’s in walking dis­
tance. The coffee house has 
taken over the King’s Court 
building on Forbes Avenue, 
splashed some paint on the walls 
in a Love Sftacfe-But-Pissed-Off- 
About-the-Mess-the-World’s-In 
bend, added appropriate furni­
ture, and created probably the 
highest concentration of caffeine 
in Oakland (outside of CMU of 
course).
The new Beehive offers coffee 
and cake like the old. Although 
you can’t really get a pot —just 
a mug or cup—it’s still good and 
pretty cheap. A piece of cheese­
cake (I had the plain. I didn’t 
really have the guts to take on 
the Oreo Cheesecake, it made 
Triple Chocolate Cake look like 
a WeightWatchers’Entree.) and 
cappuccino cost less than five 
bucks with a tip.
There aren’t any waiters or 
waitresses, but when you order 
there are signs on the cash reg­
isters explaining the impover­
ished condition of the employees 
who are “sooooo” poor that they 
really do appreciate the tips. You 
feel a little guilty if you don’t
leave at least your loose change 
in the jar when you go. This 
applies both upstairs and down.
The street level Beehive has 
maintained the look ofthe King’s 
Court Theatre, keeping with 
some ofthe same decoration and 
placing the counter where the 
concession stand used to be. It’s 
a little nostalgic, and the array 
of things displayed behind the 
counter can work those emotions 
into an impetus for spending 
more money. Besides just the 
coffee and cake, there is a myriad 
of devices on sale for producing 
coffee. So,ifyou’renot completely

you leave, you can go home and

My friend called the other day to 
deliver some unfortunate news. He was 
Upset because his fat dog Mel had died. 
For some reason I just couldn’t under­
stand why this was being handled as 
such a tragedy when for the last five 
years Mel could do nothing physical 
but roll his crimson eyeballs at passing
Mel had long ago deteriorated into a 
mound of Labrador plopped on a blan­
ket in the entry way, but for his loving 
owners, canine euthanasia was out of 
the question. Everyone who visited my 
friend’s house from our high school 
would beckon for Mel’s patented crim- 
son-eyeball-roll as a sign of life against 
the subtle fumes of cell break-down. 
Just when we were sure that Mel was 
finally the name of a carcass, he’d flash
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO 
PLATINUM BLONDES?
By Andrew Cosentino
his red eyes like a battery light on a 
smoke alarm. “Look, there they go. Can’t 
throw it out yet.”
A few years back, when Mel devel- 
opedatumorthatrivaledtheSkydome, 
they moved him from the entry way to 
the livingroom because toomany people 
were hanging their coats on his back. 
It’s hard not to pet a dog when you’re 
watching TV next to it in the living 
room, even a dog with a tumor. We used
to pet the front half of Mel until we 
came within about five inches of the 
Skydome, then we’d lift our hand over 
it and pet the back half of Mel. Very odd 
looking.
The tumor often became the focus of 
attention in the living room, especially 
during the summer when something 
boring came on TV.
It was kind of interesting the way we 
all had mixed reactions toward it. I 
could barely look at it, a couple of guys 
liked to poke at it with a finger, and 
first-time viewers always developed a 
kind of glazed look, arriving at the 
conclusion “Man, that’s a lot of meat.”
But the saddest part about Mel being 
moved to the living room has to do with 
the fact that he was forced to sit through 
hours of soap operas with my friend’s
grandmother. It took some time, but 
eventually I think Mel developed a real 
liking for the soaps. He opened his eyes 
and rolled them more frequently dur­
ing The Bold and the Beautiful than at 
any other time of the day.
The sad part? Mel went deaf just two 
days before they revealed whether or 
not that greedy bastard Kip really mur­
dered Diana.
After Mel went deaf, I think he real­
ized that since he would never again be 
capable of responding to his master’s 
call, even with a crimson-eyeball-roll, 
then among all else, he had become a 
cat in his old age and it was no longer 
worth living. Over the past summer, I 
witnessed a good number of Mel’s sui­
cide attempts, including a log roll down 
the basement steps. My friend put his
ping-pong paddle down and went over 
to help Mel. He hadn’t seen the old 
boy (Mel) walk that far on his own in 
years.
At least Mel finally rests in peace. 
For some reason, I really think Mel 
wanted out a long time ago. For one 
thing, his vet was a hack. But I think 
I knew Mel’s feelings better than any­
one because of something that hap­
pened over winter break last year, 
something I’ll never forget. I was hold­
ing a 60 lb. dumbbell in my friend’s 
basement and Mel dragged his body 
over, looked up with his bloodshot, 
tired eyes and barked out of the cor­
ner of his snout a message I will 
always interpret as, “Look jerkie, I 
never asked for much, drop that on 
my head.”
Simonton relates female sex roles
ANN SIMONTON-, from LI
screen, on the printed page, as 
symbols of submissiveness. 
Controlled by men, mocked by 
men, abused by men, and all for 
men’s convenience.
Her realization that women in 
the media are all too often objec­
tified, treated as inanimate toys, 
exploited, disrespected, spat
upon, drove Simonton to fight to 
regain every ounce of confidence 
she had been robbed of. Awak­
ened, Ann Simonton set out on 
her own road to retribution, 
while helping other fashion mod­
els see their oppressed position. 
Arrested a number of times, she 
persevered, as she continues to­
day.
In graphic protest of beauty 
pageants, she donned a robe 
sewn of raw steak. In written 
protest of all misuse of women’s 
images, Simonton founded a 
quarterly newsletter in 1984 
titled Media Watch, “dedicated 
to empowering individuals to 
take an active role in improving 
women’s image in the media.”
With Media Watch, Simonton 
has also produced a videotape 
with shocking examples of the 
exploitation of women. And in 
verbal protest, Simonton trav­
els the country raising levels of 
awareness through participat­
ing in demonstrations and giv­
ing lectures, like the one she 
gave here on Monday.
WalkPittsburgh highlightes culture
PITTSBURGH, from page L2
Gangewere collected his infor­
mation about the architecture 
and culture that is included in 
the tour.
When Gangewere was asked 
how he decided on what sites to 
include, his wife, Linda, said, “It 
is very easy to see all of the city 
on your own. Everything is so 
very close together. One can see 
so many different periods of ar­
chitecture right within walking
distance. We consider this tour 
the ‘thinking person’s guide to 
Pittsburgh.”
The featured landmarks are 
the Kaufmann’s Clock, the 
Courthouse, and the Gange- 
weres’ personal favorite, Mellon 
Square.
“Mellon Square is our favorite 
place because from here it is 
possible to see all of Pittsburgh, 
like the PPG Place, the Alumi­
num Building, Mellon Bank, and
the Frick Building. On a nice, 
sunny day, one can enjoy a pic­
nic lunch while listening to live 
jazz,” said Gangewere.
Eventually, the Gangeweres 
would like to sell the 
WalkPittsburgh Tour to the 
people in Pittsburgh who are 
responsible for bringing people 
into the area for relocations, 
businesses, and the like.
WalkPittsburgh has only been 
in existence for four years, but
there are plans to create the 
next generation of walkingtours. 
For example WalkOakland, 
WalkNorthside or Walk- 
Southside could be appearing 
on sale racks sometime in the 
near future.
So, take a couple of hours out 
of your weekend, grab a copy of 
the WalkPittsburgh tour, and 
enjoy the sites, culture, and ar­
chitecture of the city in which 
we live.

Experience every male’s greatest fear — the ‘women’s store’
My friend Marni just got a CD 
player and, as you can imagine, 
jS having the time of her life 
buying CDs galore. Beingagood 
friend of her’s (and a nice guy) I 
told her about some of the better 
CD stores in the Pittsburgh area 
_ the CD stores which you need 
a car to get to. That was a big 
mistake.
“Oh, Steve! Could you please 
take me there? Please, please,
What could I do? Say “no?” 
(Actually I did, at first, and you 
should have seen the look on her
face!)
“Of course, Mami. Ill take you 
there.”
So we hop into my car, slap on 
the music, and drive to Record- 
Rama in the North Hills — a 
store with over 40,000 CDs. As 
we pull into the parking lot, I 
think to myself, “She’ll love this 
place! This place has everything! 
I can’t wait to see how many 
CDs she buys!”
She bought one CD. Now, I 
wouldn’t have minded if it was 
one of those rare CD’s which are 
handmade in the mountains of 
Tibet, but no. She bought one of 
those mundane, easy-to-find, 
mass produced, American CD’s.
nd she didn’t even buy it for 
herself. I just stared into space, 
ijontemplating if there really are 
aliens out there, if they have 
female friends which put them 
through this type of torture, and 
if they would like sit around and 
talk about it over a beer.
“Steve?” Mami asks in that 
female sort of way which snaps 
a male out of any daydream and 
demands his full attention.
“Yes?” I respond in that male 
sort of way which lets her know 
that I’m eagerly awaiting her 
next word, let alone her next 
breath.
“Do you want to go clothes
LIFE, THE UNIVERSE, 
AND STEVE
by Stephen Glicker
shopping with me? It won’t take 
more than an hour!”
Now I’ve seen a lot of things in 
my life — Reagan getting shot, 
the Challenger disaster, my 
friend Jason passing out into a 
barbecue pit while he was drunk 
— but I’ve never witnessed one 
of my female Mends shop for 
clothes in less than an hour. 
Perhaps that’s the reason why I 
said “yes,” just to see if she would 
actually surprise me.
So we drove to Ross Park Mall 
and as we approached, I noticed 
something interesting. People’s 
cars were parked on the- grass 
surrounding the various park­
ing lots. That’s right, the park­
ing lot had actually run out of 
room. Suddenly, fear washed 
over me and my subconscious 
took over.
Run! Hide! ESCAPE!
But there was nothing I could 
do. There was no place to run. 
No place to hide. No way to es­
cape. I was completely over­
whelmed. I blacked out.
The next thing I remember, 
Mami and I were inside the m all, 
fighting our way through the 
crowd. Quickly, I got my wits 
about me, went into my New 
Yorker mode, and began plow­
ing down people around me like 
they were strands of wheat. 
Mami, also being from New 
York, was already in mode.
Things were going well, that 
was until we reachedone of those
stores which can make even the 
toughest man cringe — a 
“women’s store.”
“Look at that sweater! Come 
on Steve, let’s go in!”
“No, that’s okay, you can go in 
by yourself,” I told her, really 
believing for maybe a millionth 
of a second that I might some­
how manage not to get dragged 
inside.
“Oh, come on. Come in with 
me, please....”
What could I do?
So I went into the store with 
her and do what most men do in 
these type of stores, I looked for 
another trapped guy to talk to. 
No luck. So I tried to look inter­
ested, like I belonged here, like I 
was here with a friend and not 
some lost male who mistook this 
place for “Sporting Goods and 
Power Tools Palace.”
“What do you think of this 
Steve?” Mami asked me, hold­
ing up a sweater so small that 
you would need a license to wear 
it in some states.
“It’s nice,” I told her.
“Do you think it would look 
good on me?”
“Probably. Why don’t you try 
it on?”
“I don’t know....” At this point, 
I can easily see the question go­
ing through her head by her 
uneasy facial expression — 
should she try on this sweater 
and run the risk of showing off 
an unflattering part of her body 
in front of a male? I decided to
help her out.
“I think that you would look 
really good in that sweater. Why 
don’t you try it on just to be 
sure?”
“Oh, okay.”
Chalk one up for the good guys.
“But help me find some pants 
to match!”
Okay, chalk one up for the bad 
guys as well.
I would have helped her pick 
out pants, but women have one 
of the oddest sizing systems for 
pants on the planet. However, 
Mami finally explained it to me 
—to figure out a woman’s pants 
size all you have to do is take 
their leg length, multiply it by 
their weight, subtract the result 
by their waist size, divide this 
number by the amount of weight 
they expect to gain in the next 
fewmonths, andfinally, add the 
cube root of their butt size. Wow, 
and I thought quantum physics 
was complex.
Soon, Mami managed to find 
a pair of pants which she ex­
plained probably wouldn’t fit, 
but might look good (hearing 
this, I again began to wonder 
about those aliens). She had her 
pants, she had her sweater, she 
was ready for the “sacred area” 
— the changing rooms.
The changing room area is 
probably the only place in one of 
these stores where a female ac­
tually feels uncomfortable if a 
male is present. As I approached 
the area, I could almost feel the
tension in the air as fifteen 
women stared directly atme with 
the expression, “what are you 
doing back here?” Quickly I 
walked closer to Mami, hoping 
thatthese women would see that 
I did indeed belong back here 
and that I’m not some sort of 
pervert.
Eventually the stares died 
down, Mami tried on her clothes, 
showed me very selective parts 
of her anatomy, I told her what 
I thought (of the clothes, not of 
her anatomy), and she ended up 
buying the sweater and some 
earings (but not the pants which, 
indeed, did not fit).
The rest of the shopping spree 
went quite well. We didn’t visit 
any more “women’s stores,” 
Mami helpedme pick out a shirt, 
and I even got to drag her into a
“men’s store” or two (but not for 
long).
As we left the mall over two 
hours later (so much for my sur­
prise), and I began to fight the 
mall traffic, I was wondering if 
it was all worth it. After all, this 
little trip ended up taking al­
most five hours, I still had a ton 
of work to do, and we didn’t 
really end up buying very much.
“By the way,” Marni said. 
“Thank you very much for tak- 
ingme here, Steve. It was really 
nice of you.”
I bet those aliens get called 
“nice” too.

DIVERSIONS
Carter USM hits America with U.K. critically acclaimed sound
ByMARNIBOREK
Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
Not too long ago, right before a televi- 
sionperformance, England’s Carter the 
Unstoppable Sex Machine(CarterUSM 
for short) shared a dressing room with 
the New Kids On the Block, Marky 
Mark, and Color Me Badd. A definite 
dash of musical cultures: two popular 
indie musicians face to face with sym­
bols of the American bebop/hiphop 
genre. There’s always that chance that 
Carter USM stumbled into the wrong 
Messing room. But then again, their 
experience could have been a symbol of

cpn,music scene.

•SMF directing the new “British inva­
sion” in America, Carter USM, com­

in the Skibo Ballroom. Tickets are $15.75

name of the group was created by using 
the last name of Fruitface’s real name 
(Les Carter) and the “Unstoppable Sex 
Machine” came from an old song they 
used to perform. The duo adopted their 
nicknames Jim Bob and Fruitface un­
der completely different pretenses. Jim 
Bob’s real name is Jim Morrison — he 
didn’t want any confusion amongst fans. 
Les Carter became Fruitface after his 
poor vision and big ears were com­
mented on.
The group first gained the attention 
of the U.K. audiences in 1988 and has 
remained on the cutting edge of the 
music scene ever since. Magazines 
such as New Musical Express and 
Melody Maker are plastered with ar­
ticles praising the duo’s records 101 
Damnations and 30 Something.
Carter’s 101 Damnations contains 
such energy -crazed songs as “Sheriff 
Fatman,” “An All American National 
Sport,” and a “Perfect Day to Drop the 
Bomb.” The guitar riffs, synthesizer, 
and Jim Bob’s singing, which lies more 
on the border of a recitation at times 
strongly influence audiences’ urges to 
either dance or bash whatever pieces of 
furniture are in their path. But it looks 
like this is the type of reaction Carter 
wants to generate.
30 Something’s tracks are more re­
fined than the ones found on 101 Dam­
nations. Songs such as “Anytime, Any­
place, Anywhere” resemble the pop/ 
guitar style found on Jesus Jones’ first 
album Liquidizer. “A Prince in a 
Pauper’s Grave” has a fascinating yet 
haunting melody line that resembles 
the music played as a merry - go - round 
spins round and round. Surfin USM is 
a thrashing theme song with lyrics cre­
ated by Carter fans — You fat bastard. 
The lyrics were created when adipose 
endowed technician John Beast began 
introducing Carter's live shows.
The lyrics written singer/guitarist 
Jim Bob are strong commentaries on 
the times we live in. Although the 
songs make most to England the topics 
sung about, such as war and dealing 
with what goes on in the city streets are 
universal. On 101 Damnations Jim Bob 
sings of how “both my arms and legs are 
torn to shreds, my eyes tired and grey... 
and when I come home today look away 
... look away”ia the graphic“G.I. Blues.” 
On “The Final Comedown” from 30 
Something, he sings of living in the 
streets—“I’ve looted and I’ve begged on 
the tubes of the Bee and Broadway ... 
I’ve been buggered, bewitched and aban­
doned.”
Carter does not feel that it is the 
music and lyrics alone that make them 
appealing to crowds.
“There is something about the record, 
but we think the live show is what 
makes us. People get more than they 
expect out of two people,” says Jim Bob.
The live shows have built up Carter’s 
reputation in the past. First, John Beast 
attempts to introduce Carter, but is 
bombarded with chants of “you fat bas­
tard“ before he can even open his mouth.
We thought the Pet Shop Boys were farts 
anyway. We usually end up standing in the 
corners of all their parties.
— Jim Bob
Singer/guitarist/lyricist
Jim Bob and Fruitface stand at oppo­
site sides of the stage with lighting 
effects taking place in the backdrop. 
When more lighting is made available 
a huge board with the letters USM 
flash wildly atthe audience. The group’s 
stage presence and the special effects 
have excited U.K crowds to the point in 
which shows sold out. Fans would stand 
outside the clubs Carter was playing 
hoping to hear segments of their music.
Now that Carter USM has entranced 
the U.K youth, they will try to do the 
same with America’s music chart fol­
lowers. They recently signed a record 
deal with U.S.-based Chrysalis. 101 
Damnations was released on Chrysalis 
this past August, and 30 Something 
was released at the tail end of October. 
The group toured the U.S. this summer 
with EMF and began their American 
“quest for fame” campaign. Now they 
are touring with EMF once more, mak­
ing a stop at Carnegie Mellon tonight.
“There is a lot of pressure in getting 
exposure. The record company [Chrysa­
lis] wants us to do it while the iron is 
hot, before everyone goes off EMF and 
Jesus Jones,” says Jim Bob of Carter’s 
introduction to the American public. 
“We don’t want all the stuff that goes 
along with exposure, but we have to
deal with it. If we could be exposed 
sitting at home watching TV it would 
be great.”
The duo’s relationship has changed 
after a year of touring and promotion, 
which eventually led to their success.
“When you start making money, 
you’re put into a different situation. 
You’re not struggling anymore and don’t 
need as much support,” says Jim Bob. 
“Fruitface and I get along fine, but we 
need to get away from each other a little 
more now. Otherwise we can get in the 
way of what goes on stage. In one gig we 
did on the last tour we couldn’t even 
look at each other.”
With their attitudes towards each 
other and their music, one might won­
der what Carter thinks about Ameri­
can artists —I after all, they weren’t 
hesitant about displaying their dislike 
for groups like The Inspiral Carpets 
and the House of Love back in England.
“The impressive thing about music is 
that I don’t really hate anyone any­
more. I used to blow off bands all the 
time, but once you meet them and all, 
you feel guilty,” says Jim Bob.
It looks like Carter won’t mind shar­
ing a dressing room with the New Kids 
On the Block, Marky Mark, and Color 
Me Badd any more.
King Stag delivers a 
royal performance
By AMY POTTHAST
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
King Stag opened Saturday 
night at Kresge Theatre as CMU 
Drama Department’s second 
show of the season. In a brilliant 
splash of vivid colors, Carlo 
Gozzo’s slice of commedia 
idl'arte is revived with energy 
and succinct timing by director 
Larry Arrick and a lively crew of 
versatile actors.
The play is a fable of true fairy 
tale caliber, including a winding 
plot, true love, villains, heroes, 
and even a song and dance every 
once in a while. At the play’s 
opening, King Deramo is in 
search of a bride. With a choice 
of two thousand, he chooses the 
one whom he thinks will best 
suit his kingdom (who truly loves 
him, not his title), and whom he 
will best suit. When at last he 
decides Angela is his destined 
bride, the fathers of the other 
two women are in an uproar. 
One father, Tartaglia, is twice 
as upset — his daughter 
Clarissa was rejected, and the 
woman he covets, Angela, is go­
ing to be married to someone 
else!
Using a magic spell to compli- 
catematters and outsmart King 
Deramo, the wicked and selfish 
Tartaglia seeks revenge. Man­
aging to overthrow Deramo’s 
throne, Tartaglia has power, 
obedience, and Angela for a time, 
but his plan soon backfires. Vic­
tory for the benevolent forces is 
at last realized when banished 
sorcerer Durandante returns 
aijd — poof! — makes everyone 
h^ppy again.
¡\ttired in overalls and sus- 
pénders, two of the play’s most 
türilling performers roll the plot 
smoothly along, filling in gaps 
with pantomime, puppeteering, 
and parroting. Seniors Michael 
J.;Fiúler and Michael Lucas as 
thje Puppeteers are phenomenal 
in; their partnership. Working 
together as one creature, or as 
tvio similar creatures, Fuller and 
Lucas are syncopated, articu­
late, -and hilarious. The concen­
tration and discipline that was

required of them to work as a 
team could not be overstated. 
And they are definite successes 
in their attempts.
Another commendable perfor­
mance is that of senior Sara 
Momell as the Dolly Parton- 
esque character Smeraldina. 
With a pink cotton candy head 
and snappy mountain accent, 
Mornell’s work is a blast to 
watch. Taking her character se­
riously, and allowing the situa­
tions to create the humor, in­
stead of the other way around, 
Momell is a welcomed sight on 
stage.
The character who speaks the 
least often steals the show, and 
in this case senior Ferrell Barron 
earns that distinguished honor. 
As the Guard/Huntsman/Peas­
ant, Barron absolutely tackles 
his roles with physical strength 
and an intellectual strategy to 
colorfully fill what could easily 
be unnoticed space. From gong- 
ing a gong to beating a drum to 
death, Barron is beautiful.
An integral part of the show is 
actor Erik Jensen who stars as 
King Deramo. The only justifi­
able straightman in the show, 
Jensen is straightforward and 
noble in his role. His regal heir 
and honest delivery help the 
audience understand the story 
with not just their minds, but 
also with their hearts.
Occasionally in the course of 
the play, the characters onstage 
break into lip-synch and dance. 
The songs vary from Man of 
LaMancha's “The Impossible 
Dream” to the ’50s classic “Earth 
Angel.” In one particularly im­
pressive eruption of silliness, the 
actors break into Michael 
Jackson’s “Beat It,” and indeed
do a bang-up job.
Seniors Chadley Kelderman 
as Brighella and Brent Jefferson 
Lowe as Truffaldino flash their 
Michael Jacksonimitations with 
amazing accuracy and spirit. 
With such vivacious celebration 
onstage, who could stop smil­
ing? Lowe also has another sur­
prising task in the show. On 
occasion he falls from the flys to 
the stage strapped in a bunjee 
cord.
Not all the actors are as enter­
taining, however. The role of 
Angela, King Deramo’s object of 
love, is a potentially adorable, 
energetic, and gleaming aspect 
of the show. However, sopho­
more Emily Skinner weighs the 
character down with a lead fa­
cial expression, monumentally 
lacking a sense of humor. Her 
cheerful smiles in the dance 
numbers seem hypocritical, 
phony, even betraying her es­
tablished wooden character. Her 
thick, quivering, and monotone 
voice, though loud and articu­
late, is grossly out of place in an 
otherwise peppy, light-hearted 
show. Rather than perceiving a 
princess, the audience is forced 
to watch an imitation ofVictoria 
Jackson imitating Sally 
Struthers on Saturday Night 
Live. Skinner, lighten up!
Senior Michael Siracusano, as 
the villain Tartaglia, also has a 
potentially exhilarating role. But 
his curious lack of energy and 
lack of focus serve to effectively 
destroy his performance. The 
weak grasp he has on his char­
acter begs the audience to fill in 
his motives with their imagina­
tions; ouch. Tartaglia is not evil 
until, out of nowhere, he begins 
acting evil. And even then his 
scheming ways and words only 
float out of his mouth, as if 
Siracusano himself has no con­
trol over what he is saying. He 
does attempt a stutter, in tradi­
tional commedia style, but that, 
of course, is not enough to save 
his work.
Directorially, the showis clean 
and unified. The vibrant theme 
of colors sails through out the 
show, like an exploded beach
Senior Erik Jensen presents his bride-to-be in the Carlo Gozzi play King Stag.
ball on the stage. Colorful char­
acters, costumes, and set pieces 
are sewn together with continu­
ous, seemingly spontaneous ele­
ments ofsurprise. Director Lariy 
Arrick molds the show by letting 
it spring to action on its own.
Except for the missing aid for 
Siracusano’s misguided perfor­
mance, Arrick’s responsible del­
egation of creativity seems to 
work remarkably well.
Costumes, designed by Beth 
Levine, are outrageous. The 
whole spectrum of colors is em­
ployed in this production, from 
wacky orange wigs to chic purple 
shoes. Levine and her crew have 
outdone themselves. Some cos­
tumes seem a little too disorga­
nized, but they all work to the 
same effect. However, it was a 
relief at the very end of the show 
when King Deramo at last dis­
carded his ghastly blue mane.
With acting and dancing, mim­
ing and lip-synching, bunjee 
jumping, and puppeteering,
King Stag has it all. Even the 
curtain call is exciting! For an 
evening of escape, visit the king­
dom of Serendip and the neigh­
boring forest of Roncislap, and 
forget your cares as easily and 
happily as most of the charac­
ters forget theirs. You’ll only 
regret it if you don’t go to see the 
show.Seniors Michael Siracusano and Kelly Bertrand discuss the upcoming 
marriage of King Deramo in a comfortable father-daughter stance.

Random news and thoughts on TV land
"Random news and thoughts 
collected while wondering what 
td write about this week:
Ted Turner has bought 
Hanna-Barbera. Yes, it’s true, 
folks, Mr. Moneybags has taken 
another step toward ownership 
of the entire television industry 
With the purchase of this fa­
mous cartoon company.
With the deal comes all of 
Hanna-Barbera’s inventory, in­
cluding thousands of cartoons. 
Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, 
T6m and Jerry, and others will 
probably be turning up on TNT 
of TBS in the near future. The 
most famous Hanna-Barbera 
creations, The Flintstones and 
The Jetsons, will be in syndica­
tion for a few more years, but 
when ownership reverts to 
Turner, look for him to start an 
all-cartoon cable channel.
Carol Burnett is back. The 
update of her old variety show 
premiered a couple of weeks ago 
and airs Fridays at 9 pm on 
KDKA-2. So far, the jury’s still 
out. In the premiere, the situa­
tions and writing were nothing 
new. Burnett and guest Martin 
Short saved the skits. It’s been 
performingdecently, but already 
some of the producers have been 
fired. Let’s hope that internal 
struggles don’t ruin the chances 
for this show’s success.
I survived Hurricane Sat­
urday. As a sweeps gimmick, 
NBC had a fictional hurricane 
rush through its three Miami- 
based sitcoms. I made it through 
most of Golden Girls and the 
first fifteen minutes of Empty 
Nest. At this point I decided that 
1) this hurricane thing was noth­
ing more than an excuse to have 
characters cross over from show 
to show, 2) the shows them­
selves, once a pleasure to watch, 
had become boring, predictable,
THE LAUGH TRACK
,n (b W1ouTa8u HSmmam1
and quite unfunny, and 3) I had 
more worthwhile things to do on 
a Saturday night. So I stuck in 
my tape of My Three Sons.
Fox 53 (WPGH) has in­
serted reruns of Matlock into 
its weekday schedule (Mon- 
day-Fridayatllam). Though 
I have never actually seen this 
show, it feels like I have. Basi­
cally, it seems to be Andy Taylor 
meets Perry Mason. Silly detec­
tive fluff, Father Dowling Mys­
teries caliber. It doesn’t sound 
harmful, but it also doesn’t sound 
like anything I’d want to watch. 
What upsets me most is that 
WPGH axed Family Ties and 
The Brady Bunch in favor of old 
Mr. Griffith.
The “gay” episode of Quan­
tum Leap will air after all. 
While I’ve always found the ex­
ploits of Sam and A1 to be fairly 
entertaining, I’ve never taken 
this show too seriously. It seems 
to me that a program with such 
a neat concept could do better 
than rehashes of storylines from 
several nondescript seventies 
and eighties adventures.
That’s why this episode, whose 
script was not originally ap­
proved by NBC, both intrigues 
and scares me. It seems that 
Sam will leap into the body of an 
Army cadet whose friend is ex­
posed as being gay. Sam must 
try to stop his friend from pub­
lishing a list of fellow cadets 
who are gay, and convince him 
not to commit suicide. Poten­
tially powerful stuff.
The mere willingness of Quan­
tum Leap to portray a gay char­
acter is a positive sign and, in 
my opinion, a step in the right 
direction. However, this show’s 
track record still worries me. 
While “controversial” issues 
have been handled before (Sam 
has leaped into a single preg­
nant woman, a soldier fighting 
in the Vietnam War, and even a 
laboratory monkey), an overly 
melodramatic and quite predict­
able plot ends up making the 
controversial element of the 
show seem quite mundane.
In an attempt not to take sides, 
Quantum Leap ends up missing 
a chance to take a stand and 
make any comment at all. This 
program could conceivably pro­
vide some emotionally jarring, 
quality programming that re­
ally moves the viewer. Instead, 
it comes off as Jake and the 
Fatman with a twist.
Tony and Angela are get­
ting married. This may sur­
prise those of you who thought 
Who’s the Boss had been can­
celled long ago; to the rest of us, 
it’s a relief. This courtship, seven
years old, was getting downright 
painful. Of course, so is the show: 
there’s not too many things 
worse than a once-decent sitcom 
on its way out. Look at the later 
episodes of D iff rent Strokes, if 
you can. Both Who’s the Boss 
and Growing Pains, relegated to 
Saturday nights on ABC, have 
become nearly unwatchable.
On the rumor mill: David 
Letterman, upset at being 
passed by for the Tonight Show 
hosting duties, has allegedly 
signed a huge secret contract 
with ABC. I’ll believe this only 
when I see it. First of all, Dave’s 
contract with NBC runs at least 
another year. Plus, Dave has it 
real good at NBC, no matter 
how much he complains. He gets 
good ratings in his 12:35 am 
slot, and he probably has a show 
for as long as he wants it. A 
move to ABC would be too dam 
risky.
Keep your eye on Bill 
Cosby. This is definitely the last 
season for The Cosby Show, but 
Bill will be back next fall in a
revival of Groucho Marx’s You 
Bet Your Life. I, for one, cannot 
wait.
The ten shows I will go out 
of my way to watch:
10. Parker Lewis Can’t Lose 
(Sunday at 7:30 pm on WPGH-
53). OK I admit I’ve missed a 
few episodes, but this is fun TV.
9. Doug and Rugrats (Sunday 
at 10 am and 10:30 am on Nick­
elodeon). Two of the most enter­
taining cartoons on the air. 
(Okay, it’s two shows. So sue 
me.)
8. In Living Color (Sunday at
8 pm on WPGH-53). Consistently 
hilarious, and almost always 
controversial.
7. Saturday Night Live (Sat­
urday atll:30pmon WPXI-11). 
There may be more bad nights 
now than in the past, but it’s 
still event television.
6.- Brooklyn Bridge (Wednes­
day at 8 pm on KDKA-2). Mov­
ing up the list fast.
5. LA. Law (Thursday at 10 
pm on WPXI-11). Soap-opera? It 
sure is, and I’m hooked.
4. Northern Exposure (Mofii' 
day at 10 pm on KDKA-2) 
Quirky, touching, funny, aia^i 
ing.
3. Murphy Brown (Monday at
9 pm on KDKA-2). The funniest 
ensemble since Mary Tyttr 
Moore. ¦-<*,
2. Roseanne (Tuesday at 9 pjÿ> 
on WTAE-4). The lady is goo}
1. The Simpsons (Thursday at"
8 pm on WPGH-53). Week jif 
and week out, the highest-quâj'.’ 
ity program on television. So;
packed with references andjokes
that it’s possible to watch 
same episode five times and stffl' 
not catch all of them.

Cape Fear weaves an intellectual tale of terror
gy NICOLE ALLEN &
TRINETTE CHANDLER
Julian Staflwriters
«You will learn something about loss, 
j^gs of freedom.” These immortal words 
were spoken by Max Cady, a vicious 
psychopath who has returned to wreak 
^¡5 revenge in the movie Cape Fear.
’Robert DeNiro, two-time Academy 
¿-.vard winner, plays Max Cady, a self- 
righteous ex-convict who wants to ter­
rorize his former defense attorney Sam 
Bowden (Nick Nolte). Because Bowden 
suppressed evidence that would have 
changed the outcome of Cady’s trial, 
Cady spent 14 years of his life in 
prison. This fact alone is what leads to 
a life or death struggle in Cape Fear.
Cape Fear is a remake of the 1962 
Jim of the same title, but takes sus­
pense from a different angle than the 
original. Martin Scorsese has a differ­
ent interpretation of the story written 
by Wesley Strick. In this remake, 
Scorsese expands the original interpre­
tation from a man protecting his fam­
ily, to a more complex story about a 
convict who wants to make his former 
lawyer suffer severely, andbelievesthat 
his suffering will end in the ex-convict’s 
Mvation.
— Movie Review —
CAPE FEAR. A psychotic ex-convict 
embarks on a campaign of terror against 
his former lawyer and his family. Directed 
by Martin Scorsese. Starring Robert De 
Niro, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, and 
Danielle Bowden.
Scorsese, known for his work on Taxi 
Driver and GoodFellas, adds a new 
dimension to the new Cape Fear. While 
Scorsese was a fan of the original film 
directed by J. Lee Thompson, he wel­
comed the opportunity to create the 
suspense from a different angle. He has 
taken the drama to a more intricate 
level, which still delivers thrills and 
suspense.
Cape Fear is a brilliant nightmare 
and, like all nightmares, in the begin­
ning doesn’t tell us half of what we 
want to know. In the typical small town 
of New Essex in the Carolinas, every­
thing appears to be normal. In the open­
ing ofthe film, the Bowdenfamily seems 
happy. However, looks can be deceiv­
ing; the conflicts are even deeper with 
the Bowden family than usual families, 
which makes it easier for Max Cady to 
weasel his way into their lives, bring­
ing moral crisis, tension, and fear.
Jessica Lange plays Leigh Bowden, 
the wife and mother terrorized by Cady. 
She is easily taken in by Cady because 
she is still vulnerable after hearing of 
her husband’s infidelities.
Juliette Lewis stars as Danielle 
Bowden, the fifteen-year-old daughter 
of Sam and Leigh. She can sense her 
parents’ unhappiness with each other, 
and withdraws more deeply into her­
self. Her innocence makes her a perfect 
target for Cady.
DeNiro’s portrayal of Max Cady is 
done with perfection. Even his country 
accent is believable. There is a sense of 
moral self-righteousness in him; the 
tattoos that cover his body are of bibli­
cal scriptures. He quotes from the Bible 
with evangelical fervor, which has the 
ironic effect of further terrorizing Sam 
and his family. His terrorizing person­
ality is enhanced with dark humor. At 
one point in the film, Danielle throws a 
pot of boiling water on him and he 
replies, “Are you offering me something 
hot?”
Nolte’s Sam Bowden is more straight­
forward with his confrontations, but 
the real conflict exists within him. He 
ends up being pushed overthe edge, the 
edge that separates man from animal.
Phil Caruso/©1991 Universal City Studios 
Robert De Niro plays Max Cady, a 
psychotic ex-convict who embarks on a 
campaign of terror against his fomer 
lawyer and his family In Cape Fear. 
Nick Nolte’s portrayal of this transfor­
mation is done well.
Not much can be said about Jessica 
Lange’s role as Leigh Bowden. She was 
not written as a character with much 
depth, so Lange had very little to work 
with. This is a shame since she is a 
reputable actress.
Lewis’ Danielle Bowden is not a real­
istic teenager. In fact, Lewis conveys 
her character as a twelve-year-old on 
the brink of adolescence. Since when 
have teenagers skipped around? Her 
portrayal is not accurate.
The cameo cast in Cape Fear are 
actors from the 1962 version. They are 
Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, and 
Martin Balsam. Peck, who starred as 
Sam Bowden in the original, plays a 
lawyer representing Cady, and 
Mitchum plays the town sheriff.
If Martin Scorsese’s purpose was to 
make a film full of suspense, he went 
above and beyond the call of duty. At 
first, the suspense is exciting but after 
awhile, many viewers might adopt the 
“c’mon already” syndrome.
The cinematography is excellent. It 
was filmed in Panavision, which is 
shown on wide screen. This enhances 
the darker version of Strick’s story. 
Scorsese’s decision to use this type of 
cinematography was a wise one.
Cape Fear might be Scorsese’s most 
tightly-wound movie, and the goodparts 
far outweigh the bad. There is a bit of 
everything in this movie—strong char­
acterizations, thrills, chills, and a little 
humor. It’s definitely worth the trip to 
the movie theater.
Witness the Salem witch trials as opera in The Crucible
ByAMYPOTTHAST
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
The Opera Theater of Pitts­
burgh opens its fourth season 
this Sunday night with the op­
era The Crucible, based on 
Arthur Miller’s Tony Award- 
winning play. The opera, com­
missioned by the New York City 
Opera in 1961, was adapted from 
the play by Robert Ward and 
Bernard Stambler, and prom­
ises to be an exciting piece for 
contemporary audiences.
The Crucible is the histori- 
c&lly-based story of the Salem 
witch trials, and the frantic and 
obsessive struggle of one com­
munity to purge themselves of 
the evil spirits among them. 
Written by Miller in the ’50s, the 
story shares a close parallel with 
the paranoia and unsettling do­
mestic aggression of the 
McCarthy era. As the ’50s was a 
complacent time of satisfaction 
and fear of Communism, so the 
17 th century was a time of bore­
dom and fear of the unknown 
wilderness.
1 In The Crucible, the disquiet­
ing, deeply embedded fears es­
calate to hysteria. In Salem, 
some girls have dabbled in black 
magic, imported from Barbados 
by a slave girl. The girls are 
caught, and panic ensues. Who’s 
bewitching these girls? Like a 
fire, the whole town catches and 
spreads the virus of accusation. 
Power, greed, and misinforma­
tion, blatantly abused, climax to 
an explosion, ending in tragedy.
Directed by Gary Race, criti­
cally acclaimed director of past 
Opera Theater productions, the 
Opera Theater’s The Crucible 
focuses on the timeless issues of 
os, destruction, and political 
prowess. The only contemporary 
opera scheduled for production 
in Pittsburgh this season, The
— Theater Preview —
THE CRUCIBLE. Based on the 
Salem witch trials of the 17th 
century. Performs this Sunday at 
7:30 pm, in the Carnegie Music 
Hall. For information about tickets 
call 683-0725.
Crucible will be conducted by 
Barbara Yahr, Music Director 
of the Pittsburgh Youth Sym­
phony and Assistant Conductor 
of the Pittsburgh Symphony. 
Featured in its cast are profes­
sional opera singers from New 
York and Pittsburgh, on the 
verge of their promising careers. 
Guests to the Opera Theater are 
six students from Carnegie 
Mellon’s Department of Music.
The six CMU students in­
volved play the core of the witch 
hunt. Six girls who have inno­
cently meddled in the black 
magic are now pointing their 
fingers at others in possessed- 
like trances, and are accused of 
being witches in the same mass- 
hysterical climate.
Professor Ralph Zitterbart, 
who is close friends with the 
show’s director Gary Race, asked 
six of his opera workshop stu­
dents to contribute their talents 
to the opera. The Carnegie Mel­
lon students jumped at the op­
portunity to work with profes­
sional artists in such an exciting 
show.
Two ofthe six are senior vocal 
performance majors Camille 
Kowash and Louisa Tedoff. Al­
though they are the youngest of 
the cast, Kowash explains, “The 
best part is ... we get to work 
with a lot of people who are just 
starting to make their break.” 
Learning by example is a con­
firmed and effective way ofleam- 
ing, especially when the ex­
amples are so good.
For instance, Fontaine 
Follansbee, in the role of Abigail, 
has performed with opera com­
panies across the country, and 
even in France’s UOpera deLille. 
Thomas Potter as John Proctor, 
has sung in New York’s Carn­
egie Hall, played the lead bari­
tone in the world premiere of 
Hydrogen Jukebox, Philip Glass’ 
new opera, and sang with 
Luciano Pavarotti in the Lyric 
Opera of Philadelphia’s 1986 
production of Un Ballo in 
Maschera. Such established role 
models are important sources of 
both inspiration and education
for aspiring, younger talent. 
Opportunities afforded through 
regional theaters, like the Op­
era Theater, are great additions 
to the artistic community.
Except for Nancy Maria 
Balach, who plays the part of 
Betty Paris, the CMU perform­
ers do not appear until the third 
act. Because of that fact, their 
time commitment was not dis­
tressing. Although the show, 
which premieres this Sunday 
night, will have been produced 
in a total three weeks, most of 
the CMU students were only in 
rehearsal two or three evenings
a week, while the rest of the cast 
rehearsed all day, every day.
With smaller roles, the anxi­
ety of being labeled “chorus,” 
and brushed out of the way is 
common. However, in Race’s 
production, there was not much 
likelihood of that occurring. 
Tedoff emphasizes, “Race doesn’t 
like to do things conventionally. 
He’s interested in knowing that 
everyone up there [on stage] 
knows exactly who their charac­
ter is.”
Kowash adds, “We’re not ‘cho­
rus’ up there, we’re people.”
And it’s just that kind of care-
ful attention to detail that makes 
opera, and any theater, success­
ful. “It’s reassuringto see there’s 
opera like this out there,” Tedoff 
says. It is also an excellent op­
portunity to work in an open 
and meaningful environment, 
where “everyone’s not just doing 
their own thing.”
So, if you want to see opera in 
the direction it’s heading today, 
with opera stars and opera stu­
dents, with a passionate score 
by Robert Ward, take a walk up 
Forbes Avenue to the Carnegie 
Music Hall next Sunday night to 
enjoy The Crucible.

Joe Bob doesn’t want to find his 'Wild Man’
You know who I’m already 
sick of?
Robert “Tom-Tom” Bly.
What did that take, about two 
minutes?
Sorry to keep ragging on this 
guy — actually, that’s a lie, I’m 
happy to rag on this guy — but 
if I see another pathetic weenie 
sitting in a waiting room read­
ing Iron John and figuring out 
how he can become more manly, 
I’m gonna puke all over this 
guy’s wispy white hair.
You think the feminist move­
ment was obnoxious? You don’t 
know what you’re talking about 
till you take some frustrated 
CPA’s with “Mr. Peepers” 
glasses out in the woods and 
give ’em battle-axes and lances 
to play with. (For some idea, 
though, you might compare 
former Vice President George 
“The Wimp” Bush, skulking 
around the White House like 
Eddie Haskell trying to score a 
free cookie, to the present “Iron 
George,” who started the first 
Wild Man Weekend in Iraq.)
Lemme give you some advice, 
Bobby Bly. In Texas, every week­
end is Wild Man Weekend, es­
pecially in the bars on Harry 
Hines Boulevard. We have 
wives that carpool to the jail on 
Monday morning. So here’s 
some ways that you could save a 
whole heck of a lot of time.
1) Bobby says he wants to 
“bring the interior warrior back 
to life.”
We already do this in Texas. 
The ritual begins with the fol­
lowing words: “Get your hands
JOE BOB GOES TO 
THE DRIVE-IN
,n Vim Di, D18EEe
off my girlfriend.”
Do you understand the power 
of this one concept, this single 
ritual chant? The effects of it 
can sometimes last 35 years in 
Huntsville State Prison. That’s 
how powerful it is.
2) Bobby says we must learn 
to “ride the Red, the White, and 
the Black Horses.”
We already do this, too. When 
we’re young, we learn to drive a 
Ford pickup. When we’re older, 
we save our money till we can 
get a Chevy pickup with air 
conditioning and stereo. And 
finally, after we get married for 
the third time, all we can afford 
is a Toyota pickup.
3) Bobby recommends going 
out in the woods for three days 
to “find your Wild Man.”
We do this in three hours. It’s 
called “beer.”
4) Bobby says, “You cannot 
become a man until your own 
father dies.”
We don’t like to wait that long 
in Texas. The way it works is, 
your old man whales the tar out 
of you for the first 15,16 years of 
your life, until you get that first 
big growth spurt. Then one day
you wake up and find out you 
can beat the crap out of him. You 
only have to do it one time, and 
they give you a drivers’ license.
5) Bobby says a man’s goal 
should be “kingliness.”
We do this, too. There’s one 
right that no man, in his own 
home, will evergiveup: the right 
to possession of the TV remote 
control at all times. We’ll di­
vorce any woman who challenges 
us on this.
6) And, finally, there’s this 
drum thing. “The tom-tom hon­
ors the body as opposed to the 
mind,” says Bobby.
We have a better way to honor 
the body. They’re called topless 
bars.
Hey, Bobby, I got your men’s 
movement right here.
And speaking of testosterone, 
the film debut we’ve all been 
waiting for is finally here. 
Morton Downey Jr. is a sleazoid 
coke-dealing hot-tubbing Texas 
savings-and-loan executive in 
the movie that makes you long 
for the return of his talk show— 
Legal Tender. In Morton’s big 
scene, he bugs out his eyes and 
rams an 18-inch meat cleaver 
through his henchman’s heart 
three times — once “because I 
love it.”
The plot is something about 
how Tanya Roberts owns a little 
bar in Venice, Calif., with a poker 
room in back, but she’s behind 
on her payments, so she has to 
go to the hokiest S&L in town 
and put up her sleek bod as 
collateral. (Actually, whenitgets

Me and My Girl will capture your heart
By MARY YEE
Tartan Staffwriter
There are some things that 
will never be outdated. One of 
them is romance. Me And My 
Girl shows that even though 
strolls in the park have been 
transformed to snuggling in 
front of the VCR, love is an emo­
tion that never goes out of style.
Originally created in London 
(1938), Me And My Girl is a 
musical comedy set in the 1930s. 
However, Stephen Fry’s revised 
version being shown at the Pitts­
burgh Playhouse adds freshness 
which is displayed throughout 
the performance. Bright cos­
tumes, upbeat music, and tal­
ented actors and actresses make 
this piece accessible to all audi­
ences.
Me And My Girl tells the tale 
of the young Bill Snibson. Bill, 
who lives on the poor side of an 
English town, is unaware that 
he is the legitimate heir of the 
late Viscount Hareford. 
Parchester, the Harefords’ so­
licitor, tracks Bill down and in­
forms him of his new-found 
wealth. But there is one stipula­
tion ... Bill must refine himself 
to become an “English gentle­
man.”
At first, Bill thinks that the 
Harefords are playing a joke on 
him, but eventually he believes 
the whole situation. Bill insists 
on keeping his girlfriend Sally 
Smith with him through his “re­
finement period.” Sally is a 
hardworking woman with lots 
of confidence and strength. Sally 
also shares some of her 
“unrefined” manners before the 
others of Hareford Hall. Un­
doubtedly, her curtsey evoked 
echoes of laughter from the au­
dience.
Bill resists the ways of the 
aristocratic Harefords and re­
mains sincere and romantic in 
his love for Sally. He proves him­
self to have more charm, hon­
esty, and faithfulness than the 
Harefords. Bill assures Sally 
that he can’t live without her. 
Simplicity in expressing his 
emotions with Sally makes Bill’s 
love for her more believable and 
sincere. But Sally is unsure 
where she “fits in” to Bill’s life. 
She does not want to stand in 
Snibson’s way of becoming more 
; of an aristocrat. However, at the 
; same time, Sally is tom by her 
love for Bill.
Throughout the entire musi­
cal, there are moments of Bill’s

playfulness. For instance, his 
pickpocketing trick with char­
acter Sir John’s watch is repeat­
edly done but with a different 
style each time. In the library 
scene in Act II, Bill is dressed in 
the king’s royal robes. His awk­
ward movements clearly show 
the lack of grace he has as he 
stumbles over his own costume 
and trips over himself. Yet, he 
mocks the essentials of the 
stately air of a king rather well.
Maria, the Duchess of Dene, is 
determined to change Bill into 
an aristocratic gentleman. Bill’s 
imitation of her hand move­
ments and strict ways reminds 
the audience of the playfulness, 
wit, and fun a young boy has in 
seeking out mischief. Bill gets 
all the attention he deserves with 
his funny faces and his sponta­
neous outbursts of boredom with 
Maria.
Jonathan Beck Reed, who 
plays Bill Snibson, steals the 
show. Known for his versatile 
repertoire, Reed has performed 
in over 200 regional, touring, 
off-Broadway productions in 
many diverse roles. He has been 
featured twice on Good Morning 
America, appeared in the pilot
episode of Law and Order, and 
was most recently selected as an 
outstanding actor in Who’s Who 
for 1991 in American theater.
Linda Gabier, as Sally Smith, 
arouses the audience with her 
wonderful, clear, and resonat­
ing voice. Known for her many 
roles in the past at the Play­
house such as the title role in 
Peter Pan and as Audrey in Little 
Shop of Horrors, Gabler’s pres­
ence draws enthusiasm and ex­
citement from the audience. 
Gabler’s solo in “Once You Lose 
Your Heart,” will melt the 
audience’s heart even after the 
piece is over. Gabier poignantly 
portrays Sally’s virtues, vulner­
abilities, goodness, and unself­
ishness.
Among the many talented cast 
members is CMU’s own 
Lawrence E. Street, a senior 
voice major who played Figaro 
in the music department’s pro­
duction of Marriage of Figaro 
last year. He is featured in the 
role of the Constable.
The fine acting is not the only 
highlight of the show. The danc­
ing is exciting as well. The 
“Lambeth Walk” was choreo­
graphed with genius. It unites 
the talents of the actors and ac­
tresses, thereby astounding the 
audience. The “Lambeth Walk”

Sullivan’s Travels
In this classic film which pokes fun of Hollywood 
in every way possible, Sullivan’s Travels tells the 
story of a movie director who is sick and tired of 
making fluff movies. So, he decides to do a “seri­
ous” film and sets out with 10 cents in his pocket to 
experience life in “the real world.”
Even though this film is fifty years old, it still 
packs a punch in the funny bone department. 
Spend a buck.

101 Dalmatians
As the semester slowly grinds its way to an end, 
and finals sneak craftily upon us, what could be a 
more opportune study break, a more appropriately 
timed stress-reliever than an evening in DH 2210 
watching the Disney classic 101 Dalmatians?
The charming story of 101 puppies kidnapped 
for their beautiful, black-and-white coats, and 
their daring rescue by the other dogs in town has 
delighted children for decades. See the rolly-polly 
puppies do it again, with the same energy and 
enthusiasm that won your heart when you saw 
them the first time.
Ahh, animation. Regress to a time when you 
were an unjaded little kid, when giggles weren’t 
muffled beneath a biology textbook or in an An­
drew cluster. Go see 101 Dalmatians, and be happy.
_ At least until Monday.

Terminator 2
Well, he said he’d be back, and, as advertised, 
our favorite hulking cybernetic engine of death has 
returned to maim, destroy, and spout witty com­
mentary. The plot is a mobius loop of time-travel 
paradoxes, but it fortunately doesn’t detract too 
much from the bloodshed and knee-slapping one- 
liners. The sapient silicon grouch from the ma­
chine-dominated 21st century realizes that its 
first robotic export failed to kill Sarah Connor, an 
oh-so-key figure in the eventual human revolu­
tion. So, it deploys an even nastier Version 2.0 
after Sarah’s rebellious son John. Meanwhile, the 
good guys shanghai a terminator of the same make 
and model as the original and send it back to to 
protect the Connors, and perhaps blow a few things 
up along the way.
The action is frequent, if sporadic. The dialogue 
is a bit self-indulgent sometimes, but do you care? 
Of course not. The film is great fun, and the special 
effects will make your eyes spring from their sock­
ets and roll onto your lap. Why, the scene where an 
entire city undergoes nuclear annihilation is al­
most unsettling. And nobody less than the great 
Arnold Schwarzenegger could portray an unfeel­
ing android with such conviction. Terminator 2 is 
worth your buck.

Do The Right Thing
Deciding whether or not to see Do The Right 
Thing is a struggle between appreciation for good 
direction and distaste for lack of insight. On one 
hand, the infamous Mr. Lee has a talent for con­
vincingly and vividly depicting the bark-and-growl 
of New York City racial tensions. On the other 
hand, having so expertly gathered this material, 
he doesn’t seem to know what to do with it.
The story loosely revolves around an Italian 
pizza parlor that becomes the center of a racial 
crusade, culminating in a scene of choking mob 
violence. Blacks, Whites, Italians, Koreans, and 
just about everything else with 32 chromosome 
pairs gets swept into the crescendo of protest and 
unfocused anger. But the film is inconclusive, and 
offers no reflections or ideological suggestions about 
the very real problem that it depicts. Mr. Lee is a 
filmmaker, not a philosopher, and when you’re 
handling a hot potato like racial conflict, you need 
to be at least a little of both.

EMF performs in Skibo Ballroom tonight
By MARNIBOREK
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Ecstasy motherfuckers — 
EMF. An eye-catching name for 
a group of four barely post ado­
lescent men burning their way 
to the top of the American and 
British charts. Their smash hit 
“Unbelievable” has become a 
national youth “sing in the 
shower” song, and their latest 
single “Lies” has gotten almost 
as much playtime on Pitts- 
burgh’sMixJamz as Jesus Jones’ 
repetitive “Real, Real, Real” and 
Mariah Carey’s squeaky “Emo­
tions.” The group has already 
toured the U.S. this past sum­
mer, but due to the laws of sup­
ply and demand are forced to 
perform again — this time on 
college campuses. Tonight, Car­
negie Mellon will play host to 
the techno-house/rock band.
Record stores, clubs, restau­
rants, andstreetpoleshavebeen 
plastered with posters advertis­
ing EMF’s concert performance. 
If the Skibo ballroom is still 
standing after the heavy vibra­
tions of the stereo system and 
the packed crowds tonight, it 
will be a miracle.
EMF has arrived on the scene 
at the right time. The new music 
emerging on the club scene is a

EMF. Tonight at 8 pm in the Skibo 
Ballroom. Tickets are $15.75 with 
CMU ID and $17.75 for non-CMU 
students. Tickets can be pur­
chased at the Skibo Information 
Desk.
mixture of good ol‘ guitar and 
electronic components like key­
board and synthesizer. This 
unique new sound is refreshing 
and has been successful in flush­
ing stale alternative groups such 
as Information Society out of 
club DJs’ music agendas.
EMFs debutrelease, Schubert 
Dip, is carefully constructed to 
get people out on the dance floor. 
It is also an interesting collect­
ible for those interested in mod­
em rock.
There are several highlights 
on the five-member group’s al­
bum besides “Unbelievable” and 
“Lies.” The first track, “Chil-. 
dren,” starts out with a sample 
of an ambulance siren and then 
breaks into driving synthesizer 
and keyboard patterns with gui­
tar riffs dispersed throughout 
the song. The lyrics send out the 
basic “growing up is hard to do” 
message — dreams must be 
given up and reality must be

recognized.
“Long Summer Days” is de­
ceptive at the beginning. It al­
most sounds industrial, using 
the same style as group Front 
242. It then transforms itself 
into a guitar- dominated melody 
and from there goes back into 
the conventional soft pop/syn­
thesizer mode. It’s definitely a 
tune with an enjoyable identity 
crisis.
“I Believe” is a track that 
sounds as if it belongs on Jesus 
Jones’ album Doubt. It has the 
same type of electric guitar 
sounds and lead singer James 
Atkins voice is as soft and raspy 
as Jesus Jones’ lead singer. The 
track is still admirable because 
despite its similarities, it’s ear 
pleasing. The lyrics are a bit 
confusing at first, but if one were 
to cut all the “I believe” lines out 
of the song, they are understand­
able.
The live performance of songs 
off Schubert Dip should be spec­
tacular. The band has had no 
problem satisfying audiences in 
the past. Overall, the concert 
reviews have been positive! Zac 
Foley, bass player, and Mark 
Decloedt, drummer stay with the 
rock ‘n roll rhythms while sam­
pler Derry Brownson throws his 
sampling machine about like he 
did in the video for “Unbeliev­
able.” Atkins focuses on the 
crowd, singing or somewhat rap­
ping with his raspy sweet En­
glish accent.
EMF has shown the media and 
the public their charisma and 
musical ability. With these quali­
ties and their youthful innova­
tion there is no doubt that their 
Carnegie Mellon concert won’t 
fall short of anything but unbe­
lievable.
