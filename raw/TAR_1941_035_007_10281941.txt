Math Chib Hears 
Talk By Dr. Olds
Carnegie Tech’s Undergraduate 
Mathematics Club will hold its first 
meeting of the current year at 3:30 
p. m. this Friday in Room 210, In­
dustries Hall. Dr. E. G. Olds, As­
sociate Professor of Mathematics, 
will speak on “Control Charts,” a 
subject of interest to both the 
mathematician and the engineer. 
This paper is concerned with an ex­
amination of the basic principles of 
control chart construction and an 
investigation of the efficiency of 
the general method in detecting 
trouble in production. Mathe­
matical models for controlled and 
uncontrolled processes will be con­
structed and analyzed. The lec­
ture will be illustrated with slides. 
All students and faculty members 
who are interested are cordially in­
vited to attend this meeting.
The officers of the Club, for 
1941-42 are: Ralph E. Beatty, Jr., 
’42, President; Norman H. Painter,

On the evening of November 7, 
just one week from Friday, Tech­
ites will be wending their way to 
the Men’s Gym to attend the an­
nual Military Ball. The tradition»- 
al popularity of the dance can be 
attributed to the fact that it is 
the first formal dance of the year 
and always features an outstand­
ing, nationally prominent orches­
tra. This year it will be Lang 
Thompson with his “Tunes in the 
Thompson Tempo” who will fur­
nish the music. The dance will last 
from 9:00 P. M. till 1:00 A. M. and, 
as has been the custom, favors will 
be awarded to all attending cou­
ples. The cost of the entire even­
ing’s entertainment is $3.30 per 
couple—tax included. Tickets may 
be obtained from thé Scabbard and 
Blade organization, or at the Mil­
itary Office.
Every fall the Scabbard and 
Blade society, the R. O. T. C. hon­
orary fraternity, sponsors the Mili­
tary Ball. Custom dictates that the 
affair be held on the weekend clos­
est to Armistice Day. Because of the 
military theme, all R. O. T. C. stu-
dents are encouraged to wear their 
uniforms. The dance will be formal.
One of the outstanding attractions 
of the: ball is the appointment of 
fifteen of our most comely lassies 
to the position of Honorary Cadet 
Officers. Each year prior to the 
dance, the R. O. T. C. contingent 
chooses by ballot the fifteen senior 
girls deemed outstanding in charm, 
appearance, and activities. Then 
amid much pomp and ceremony at 
the dance, the girls receive their re­
spective yanking as honorary cadet 
officers. The appointments to the 
various ranks will, however, not be 
made until the night of the dance.
The choice of Lang Thompson for 
Tech’s Military Ball is quite an 
appropriate one since Lang origin­
ally intended to become a chemical 
engineer. He enrolled in this 
course at La Salle Jr. college, but 
was forced to quit school and work 
in an engineering lab. At this time 
he organized a group of college-age 
boys into a band which later en­
rolled at the University of Illinois 
and played for numerous dances 
there. While at Illinois he decided 
to take up music as a career, and 
since then has won national acclaim 
for his fine orchestra.

Last Wednesday the preliminary 
survey group from the Training 
Field Production Laboratory at Fort 
Monmouth, New Jersey, arrived at 
Tech to make a short study of the 
equipment that our Physics depart­
ment offers for the defense picture, 
“Elements of Electricity,” that will 
be filmed here.
The survey group consisted of 
four men: Lieutenant Boyd, the
technical adviser; M. B. Rubin, for­
merly of Laucks and Norling, a 
well-known commercial and indus­
trial motion picture company, who 
will direct the film; Corporal Shor, 
the scenario writer who was for­
merly with Republic Pictures; and 
Lieutenant Smith, a graduate of 
the Tech Physics department, who 
will be in charge of animation.
On its arrival in Pittsburgh this 
survey group visited Mr. Draper of 
the Buhl Planetarium to discuss the 
possibilities of making some scenes 
of the Planetarium done in action , 
which would be inserted in the film. 
The group also made a study of the 
equipment at the Westinghouse Re­
search Laboratory and the Du- 
quesne Light Company with the 
view of making some scenes based 
on the industrnal equipment that 
these two companies offer. After 
studying the equipment at Tech, the 
survey group returned to Fort Mon­
mouth, where the scenario will be 
written on the basis of the labora­
tory and industrial equipment seen 
here.
The scenario will be sent to the 
War Department in Washington for 
approval, and when the approved 
scenario has been returned, Mr. 
Rubin, Corporal Shor, Lieutenant 
Boyd, and a crew of camera men 
with all their paraphernalia will ar­
rive at Tech and actually start work 
on the production. The completed 
film will be a combination of scenes 
made in the Tech Physics depart­
ment and inserts from the industrial 
laboratories.
It is interesting to note that the 
Training Field Production Labora­
tory at Fort Monmouth makes pic­
tures for the active army except the 
Air Corps. The Laboratory con­
sists of several hundred men, both 
military and civilian, and puts out 
more film footage a year than any 
major Hollywood production com­
pany. Lieutenant-Colonel M. E. 
Gillette, the Commanding officer of 
the Training Corporation, is a 
prominent figure in the motion pic­
ture world, particularly in pioneer­
ing the modern visual educational 
type film.

Tickets Available
Through the efforts of Mrs. Mal­
colm MacLeod, wife of the Head 
of the English Department , ar­
rangements have been made where­
by holders of concert, lecture, and 
theatre tickets who cannot use their 
tickets for a particular evening 
may send them to the Tech cam­
pus for use by students. Pending 
the working out of permanent ar­
rangements, interested students are 
asked tc inquire at the Office of the 
Registrar whether any tickets are 
available for a particular perform­
ance. This plan is intended for 
those students who otherwise would 
not find it possible to attend.
ROTC to See Film
Motion pictures will be used to 
instruct students of the ROTC in 
November, and since the classes will 
not be entirely filled the Military 
Department has invited students 
not enrolled in the ROTC to attend 
this presentation. The movies are 
of particular interest to Americans 
in view of the vast rearmament and 
military program that our govern­
ment has undertaken.
For the week of November 3, a 
film entitled, Defense Against 
Chemical Warfare, a group of films 
dealing with anti-mechanized de­
fense, and another group dealing 
with infantry drill are scheduled.
Tartan Notice
The TARTAN is hi need of soph­
omore reporters to serve as a nuc­
leus for the coming staff of this 
class. All those interested please 
report at the office this Friday aft­
ernoon.
Students are urged to come out 
for the business staff also since 
many positions will be open next 
year.
There will be an important meet­
ing of the Tartan staff Friday at 
4:30.
Student Paintings 
Shown in Exhibit
The new art exhibit, “Directions 
in American Painting,” opened last 
Thursday at the Carnegie Institute 
art galleries. This show takes the 
place of the famous Carnegie Inter­
national which has been suspend­
ed for the duration of the war be­
cause of the difficulty in securing 
canvases from foreign artists. Only 
American painters are represented 
in the exhibit, and the best artistry 
to be found in. our country is on 
display. Much of the fine work 
done by American painters was 
submerged in the International, 
but now they have been given a 
chance to show what they can do.
Winning canvases were selected 
Thursday night, first prize of $1,000 
going to Tom Leftin Johnson oL’ 
Bedford Village, N. Y. His paint­
ing, “American Preta,” shows a 
lynched negro being placed in a 
wheel barrow, grouped about which 
are the mourning members of his 
family. Second and third prizes 
of $700 and $500 were won by Har­
ry Dix and Dean Fansett, both of 
New York.
Carnegie students who have 
paintings in the exhibit are: Rich­
ard Crist, Alan Thompson, Everett 
Glasgow, Frank A. Trapp, Robert 
Gwathney, Frances Wright, Rob­
ert Lepper.
Contrary to the policy followed in 
the Carnegie International, this 
exhibit is .open to the public at all 
time. Tech students are urged to 
avail ’themselves of the opportunity 
and visit the exhibit which ends 
December 14.
1 Want a Team
As a reult of the “I Want A 
Team” campaign, a meeting of an 
alumni committee to back the con- 
. valescing Steffen Fund was held last 
night. Miss Marguerite Spilman, 
secretary of the Alumni Association, 
called this meeting of interested 
graduates to form a nucleus of the 
revived movement.
Charles Richardson, Student Coun­
cil president, called the campaign a 
“definite success” and stated that the 
goal will probably be reached. Last 
week-end $575 had^ been collected 
and yesterday the night school 
rallied to the cause with their gwn 
drive. Mr. Richardson’s mails have 
been heavy this week with a flood 
of letters bearing encouragement 
and what’s more important—contri­
butions.

Lottie Lehman and Fritz Reiner 
were posing for the press photo­
graphers as I entered the Reiner’s 
apartment. Patiently they rear­
ranged themselves as the bulb kept 
popping. First the two of them 
chatting; Mrs. Lehman petting the 
Reiners’ huge Irish setter and fin­
ally the two of them at the piano to­
gether with Margit Bokor and Su­
zanne Sten who appear on the pro­
gram with Lottie Lehman.
Early in the morning Mrs. Leh­
man had gotten up to see the Amer­
ican Art Exhibit at Carnegie Mu­
seum. Despite her exalted ppsi- 
tion in the artistic world she was 
kept waiting until ten o’clock when 
the exhibit was opened to the gen­
eral public. Painting is the major 
hobby among her diversions and she 
oberved the pictures with critical 
eye. Lottie was impressed with the 
unique exhibit and feels that shows 
such as these help the struggling 
American artist. Portraits and land­
scapes are what Lottie likes to de­
pict on canvas.
In her new California home, 
Mme. Lehman lives with a friend 
who formerly taught psychology at 
N. Y. U. They owned a home in 
the rugged California mountains but 
it burned to the ground in a forest 
fire that swept the district. The 
new home is in a suburban center 
and Mme. Lehman is trying to turn 
it into a farm. Two goats are
Shore
roaming the property, and next 
year, perhaps, a cow will join them. 
Mms. Lehman can’t milk as yet, and 
is quite sure the simple task will 
be too difficult for her, but she’s 
game.
Mme. Lehman thinks that we 
have a good music school at Tech. 
She is a friend of Dr. Dorian, As­
sistant Professor of music at Tech. 
They met while still in Vienna and 
renew their friendship whenever 
Lottie is in town. Her brother-in- 
law has a studio in New York where 
he teaches music. She will hold a 
master class with him in San Fran­
cisco when her tour is over.
Lottie has no specific preferences 
among the composers saying that 
“pearls of music” can spring from 
any of them. Pier concerts usually 
feature Schubert, Brahms, and 
Wagnerian music.
Margit Bokor and Suzanne Sten 
shared the honors with Mme, Leh­
man this past weekend. The former 
’is a native of Budapest and Miss 
Sten is from Berlin. Both studied 
and trained in Europe before the 
war; charming accents hint their 
nationalities.
Suzanne Sten likes to teach voice, 
but has very little time left from 
her tours. She studied at the Stern 
Conservatory of Music in Berlin. 
“American audiences are unspoiled 
and much younger than European 
audiences,” says Miss Sten. “They

Addressing themselves to student 
groups at assemblies, to" smaller stu­

convince young people wherever.' 
they meet them that understanding 
and active cooperation among Amer­
icans of all faiths is an urgent re­
quisite in tocay’s struggle to main­
tain democracy. They drive home 
their point by showing how relig­
ious differences have been used to 
create suspicion and haired and 
engender inner weakness in many 
of the now-fallen democracies of 
the world.
Army Hears Talks
The University Religious Confer-, 
ence trio preceded its present tour 
by speaking before large groups of 
selectees in the army camps. On 
July 6, they appeared before 2,000 
marines at the Marine Base in San 
Diego and a few days later address­
ed a “full house” at Fort McAr­
thur, Texas. The program, here at 
Tech, is being sponsored by Inter­
sorority Council.
The trio comes here with the full 
endorsement of West Coast religious 
and educational leaders.
The Most Rev. John J. Cantwell, 
Archbishop of Los Angeles, for­
warded this endorsement to Vol.V 
leaders: "This trialogue has been
tested and proved successful exten­
sively in California. It played a 
large part in dispelling false con­
ceptions and bigotries concerning 
the Catholic Church.”
Rabbi Edgar F. 'Magnin, of Los 
Angeles, wrote: "I favor the use
of the trialogue whenever possible. 
It is a definite means in helping to 
bring understanding and coopera­
tion between the religious bodies of 
our community.”
Dr. Robert G. Sproul, president of 
the University of California, de­
clared: “The trialogue makes a
thoughtful plea for racial and re­
ligious cooperation at a time when 
men elsewhere in the world are be­
ing urged to regard each other with 
suspicion and hate.”

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1941
Whal BN» Students Think 
About Current Happenings?
Today, the ordinary, everyday schedule oi' events has been blast­
ed out oi its complacency.
Instead ol! proceeding with caution and reserve, we accelerate 
with reckless abandon. Now everything is characterized by iirae- 
.tioiis of a second,, millions ol! foot-pounds, and billions of dollars— 
especially billions of dollars. Our entire perspective has been radic­
ally changed with the continued plundering of Hitler in his attempt 
to conquer the world—the United States included.
Certainly it is strange to observe, that in the midst of this 
gigantic upheaval of the modern world, students at Carnegie Tech 
seem oblivious to the changes taking place. Is it apparent that rising 
food prices have their origin in national defense, that Hitler is re­
sponsible for the shortage of silk stockings, that the increased oppor­
tunities for job-getting is temporary, dependent upon the length of 
the war? Do we realize that from the $1.38 now being paid for a 
$1.25 dance, thirteen cents is going to the production of “Bombs for 
Hitler?”
War is another word that appears in the headlines of the paper. 
No Attempt is.made to. analyze what it means to us now and in the 
future. “Strikes” is one of thosb'terihs that you study in Economics. . 
Neutrality, is something that you read about in. your history-courses. 
National defense is what we are doing here at Tech—no, not We, but 
those Conscientious people who realize the meaning and importance 
of freedom.
Aware of the lack of interest and the indifference to affairs out­
side of school on the part of the students, we are going to attempt 
to bring home the situations of the world to you by the inclusion of 
material dealing with national and international affairs. The ar­
ticles will be edited entirely by members of the Senior staff and will 
represent the'.views oi: the writer.
We sincerely hope that we can shake the students from their 
contented states of apathy. We welcome comments on this phase of 
our work.

An Inquiry
We received an interesting communication the other day, from a 
group called the Ethnic Minorities Commission. Sponsored by the 
National Intercollegiate Christian Council, this group has for its 
purpose the lessening of prejudice and discrimination on college 
campuses against “ethnic groups;” that is, groups like the Negroes. 
Indeed this is a worthy motive, but one difficult of execution.
Probably the main activity of the Pittsburgh group, which is 
composed of representatives from Pitt, Tech, and Pennsylvania Col­
lege for Women has been to make a survey of the attitudes and 
feelings about minority groups on various college caiApuses. Not 
only did they survey Pennsylvania, which legally is ordered to permit 
ecjuaI rights, but they surveyed West Virginia and Maryland, as well. 
The most amazing results, it seems, were not in the revelation of pre­
judice that each answering group gave, but rather in the fact that 
almost.every group said that there was no such thing as prejudice 011 
its campus, because no minority groups were admitted to the school. 
.Thus, because the students at this school were “saved” from con­
tacts with groups other than the one from which they sprang, no 
problem of exclusion and rejection existed.
In an answer sent by a Negro student at a Pennsylvania college, 
the whole problem was adequately summed up minus emotional ap­
peal or militant attitude. This boy, a student at an institution of 
higher learning, wrote to the Commission an appeal for equal rights 
and acceptance which the law sees /it to give most every group but 
which the enlightened college students apparently do not. His atti­
tude was not a hostile one, but rather was one Of interest in the fact 
that we could brag about the strength of our democracy and at the 
same time deny its existence by every discrimination and avoidance ol' one group or two.
The work of the Commission, perhaps, is not producing any 
results which its members could point to and say “See.” But at 
Jon si; il is trying to understand n.ucl uncover the various feelings and 
attitudes that the chosen 20 per cent of American youth, the college 
students, hol<I and cling to, without examining them to see their 
basis and origin. Have you examined yours1 lately? BJK.
Traditions Exam
Last -Tuesday morning at 11:30 
Tech’s entire fre&hman class took 
the Freshman Orientation Com mi t- 
'tee's Traditions Examination. The 
class' of ’45 proved its mettle when 
only twenty-live of its members 
if ailed. Ol! this total fourteen were 
members' of the Arts School and 
the remaining forty-live were En­
gineers.
The official figures released by 
chairman Paul Wines showed that 
only seventy-nine freshmen failed 
to take the exam. The large turn­
out was not actually expected by 
the committee and sufficient ac­
comodations were not at first pro­
vided. Nevertheless, Chairman 
Wines rerouted the overflow of stu­
dents to another room of the Chem­
istry Department where the test 
was held.
The reexamination is scheduled 
for this morning at 11:30 in room 
218 of Engineering Hall. The same 
Conditions prevail in that fresh­
men will not''be allowed to partici­
pate in . any extra activities until 
the examination is passed.

formal a revolutionary twist in their 
method of issuing invitations. When 
they and their friends gather at

delightful dancing music. With 
the aid of his committee, consisting 
of Jimmy Rice and Stewart Lee, 
Jack van Arsdell, the chairman, has 
tried to provide us with the best 
entertainment available. As Jack 
van Arsdell put it, “The dance is

campus and will serve to break 
down some of the barriers which 
have stood so long between many 
clubs.”
Efficiency, friendliness, coopera­
tion, and sincerity are qualities that 
have made Bob Beck one of the 
most active and popular personali­
ties on the Carnegie campus
At the head of Bob’s long list of 
activities comes editorship of the 
Carnegie Technical. In that posi­
tion, and as managing editor last 
year, he has been responsible for 
the tremendous strides forward that 
the Technical has made in recent 
years. Further honor came his way 
a few weeks ago, when he was ap­
pointed Cadet Colonel of the R. 
O. T. C.
The Carnegie chapter of Tau Beta 
Pi, engineering honorary, claims 
Bob as its vice-president. Bob’s so­
cial fiaternity is Delta Upsilon, in 
which he served as treasurer. Hon­
orary organizations to which Bob 
belongs include the Dragon- Society, 
Sabbard and Blade, Pi Tau Sigma, 
and Pi Delta Epsilon. He studies 
Mechanical Engineering in his spare 
time.

Bob’s dietary tastes run to two 
old standbys of the Pennsylvania 
Dutch, sauer kraut- and shoo-fly 
pie. Bob describes this latter food 
as a pie with black molasses and 
powdered sugar used as filling in­
stead of fruit. Incidentally, he 
claims that ice cream cones in the 
Grill are much better in the evening 
than any other time of the day.
In addition to editing the Tech­
nical and eating shoo-fly pies, Bob 
takes time out now and then to at­
tend dances, preferably in the com­
pany of a good dancer. The color of 
a girl’s hair, furthermore, makes no 
difference whatever to him.
Bob admires the “guts” of the 
Tech football team, and also appre­
ciates highly people who are ef­

things he dislikes more than the 
Pittsburgh smog is the narrow 
minded prejudice shown by both 
fraternity and non-fraternity men 
against one another.

Meet Case Team

Tartans Drop Close One
Last Saturday afternoon, the Tech team took another defeat on 
the chin when Geneva, a supposedly inferior team, surprised every­
one by scoring two touchdowns in the last five minutes of play to 
“upset” the Tartans. None of the loyal contingent of Tartan sup­
porters can name the real cause for the defeat, but all will agree 
that the team looked worse against the Covies than in any other 
game during the past several seasons.
Sevoral theories have been advanced as the cause of the defeat, 
the most logical reason beiiig that the team let down after the fine 
showing' they made against Notre Dame. Geneva outgained the 
local boys in first downs 12-7, gaining almost double the yardage in 
rushing and passing. Even so, after witnessing the game, I believe 
that Tech could easily have won the game, hands down, if they had 
played ball as they are capable of doing on occasions.
The line in particular seemed to have ail off day, especially on 
the'bffenset “Moist of the rimning-pla^K thtou»h.-:the .line.wei!e .stC(Br 
ped when the ball carrier piled up on his interference and there 
“were no holes to slide through. The opinion of a veteran football fan 
who witnessed the game was that both lines were the most sluggish 
that he had seen in years, and 1 believe that everyone who saw the 
.game will agree with this observation.
Coming home on the bus after the game, the team was a down­
cast and disgusted group of players. Everyone felt that the team 
played a bad game and should have easily taken the Geneva squad if they had been playing ball.
Injury List Increases
The game last Saturday was similar to the Muhlenberg contest 
in that quite a few of the boys came home beaten up and slightly 
the, worse for «sear. Hank Holets in particular, took a hard physical 
heating and was out of the game several times to recuperate. Ac­
cording to some of his fellow teammates, the Covenanters were laying 
±01- him because of his reputation as being one of the outstanding 
Tech players, and roughed him up at every opportunity. Joe Pash 
and George Matonis also went out of the game several times because 
of injuries, but none were seriously hurt. Bill Philipchuk had his 
knee badly twisted near the end of the game and had to retire to the 
bench for the duration of the contest.

and Powers, Kiski fullback suc­
cessfully booted two of three place­
ments. Kiski-scored twice on run­
ning plays and once on an inter­
cepted pass. The offense used by 
Kiski was , characterized by tricky 
reverses, , in which the ball was 
handled as many as four times,

excellent blocking. In the second 
quarter the game settled down after 
the Kiski second team entered the 
line up. Richards of Kiski scored in 
the second quarter and Barclay 
kicked the point after the touch­
down. The half ended with the 
score at twenty-seven to nothing.
Early in the second half Tech 
gained possession of the ball and 
began a drive down the field. Hal 
Fredric bucked the line for several 
first downs, but the drive was halt­
ed when the Tech boys attempted to 
make ground around the ends. Tech 
had a very weak passing attack, 
while Kiski completed over half of 
the passes attempted. Woodruff of 
Kiski made the final score of the 
game and Woodruff made the con­
version. The downfield blocking of 
Kiski was outstanding and was re­
sponsible for their long runs and 
successful punt returns.
The last quarter was the most 
evenly matched part of the game, 
for Kiski failed to score.
Although the score does seem to 
appear a little one sided, the Tech 
boys were trying hard to win. The 
Kiski boys were more experienced 
ball handlers and blockers. The 
boys of Tech played better ball this 
game, however, than they played 
against the Washington and Jeffer­
son team. The Kiski coach had 
two teams on which he could de­
pend to come through, while on the 
other hand the substitutions for 
Tech are very limited.
The Tech backs were slow get­
ting started and when they did start 
there were no holes opened for 
them. Hal Fredric, Tech half-back 
played a game worthy of mention 
for Tech. It is not known whether 
the plebes will play any more games 
this season with local teams. The 
freshmen may always look forward 
to their game with the sophomore 
team after the season is over.

Tech Defeated 
By Geneva In 
Final Quarter
In a night game next Friday night 
our Tartans meet the Case Rough 
Riders, who after losing to Lehigh, 
have wone all their home games. 
After their loss to the Lehigh team, 
Coach Ride put his Casors through 
a series of very rigorous practice 
sessions, stressing pass defense, the 
only apparent hole in the Cleve­
land team’s armor. This extra ef­
fort put forth by the Riders stood 
them in good stead in that they 
scored a victory over the Kent team.
Case Lineup
The following men will probably 
play against the Skibo squad on 
Friday night, Mike Yurcheshen, 
sertior ancl weighing'!192 pounds will 
probably start in the left terminal 
position for the Riders. He is a fair 
blocker, but his outstanding talent 
is on pass receiving and defense. 
Last year the Tech team picked 
Yurcheshen as Case’s best player. 
Clint Greenleaf will fill the other 
terminal position. He is a senior 
weighing 190 pounds. Greenleaf 
is good on offensive work. Ozzie 
Forbes and Chuck Stoll will play 
the tackle positions. Forbes is strong 
on defense as is Stoll. In the guard 
positions will be Jack Neiderhauser 
and Don Taylor. Both these boys 
are lettermen and are fine on de­
fensive play. Neiderhauser is a 
junior, and played regular guard 
on the 1940 squad. He is a good 
open blocker. Ed Svete, t sopho­
more, will fill the center posi­
tion with the help of Jim Beeney, a 
junior. Svete is considered the 
leading prospect among the incom­
ing sophomores, and has had a 
starting position in all the games 
to date. Beeney is a fair line­
man, whose best quality is his cool­
ness under fire.
In the Case backfield, Chuck 
Mlakar will play the left half posi­
tion, with Bill Bennett as right half. 
Both are good ball carriers. Bob 
Melreit, a senior, is this year’s full­
back. He is considered the Casors’ 
sparkplug. Glenn Konker, senior 
quarterback is undoubtedly the best 
man in the backfield, possessing 
talent in both passing and on de­
fense work.
Geneva Rehash
The Tartan football team lost to 
Geneva last Saturday before a 
crowd of 5,000 in Beaver Falls by a 
score of 13-6. The Plaids made a
Bntramunil Notes
very poor showing after the fine job 
they did against the mighty Notre 
Dame. The Covenanters rallied in 
the last quarter to score their thir­
teen points. They had been trail­
ing six points since the middle of 
the second period, when Tech’s full­
back, Phillipohuk, went through 
center from the Geneva one yard 
line. This was the climax of a drive 
that started from the Genova 25 
yard marker. These were the only 
scores in the game.
Geneva scored its first touchdown 
after a march of 63 yards, most of 
the ground gained by aerial plays, 
since only 15 of the 63 yards gain­
ed on this march were made by
• running the ball. On the Skibos’ 
seven yard line Covenanter Perz 
dropped back to throw a pass, but, 
unable to find an unguardaded re­
ceiver, decided to run the ball. He
• went- over standing, up. The Geneva 
captain, Bill Joyce, was responsible 
for the winning touchdown by vir­
tue of his interception of a pass on 
Tech's 30 yard line thrown by John 
Fritz. He was stopped on the Ski­
bo 20. Perz threw two incomplete 
passes, but on the third one Bruno 
came through for 16 yards and a 
first down on the Plaid 4 yard line. 
Geneva lost a yard, but then scored 
and Joyce made the placement to 
complete the score of 13.
Tech Drives To Score
Early in the second , quarter, Tech 
made a sustained drive from their 
own 45 down to the Geneva 10, a 
thirty yard pass being mainly re­
sponsible for the gain. The pass 
was from Fritz to Matonis. On a re­
verse to right end, Fritz fumbled 
and Matter of the Covenanters re­
covered. The Genevans then kick­
ed to Fritz who returned to the 25 
after running seven yards. The 
Techites then tried a pass play, but 
Fritz was rushed, and made a wild 
throw with Geneva intercepting. 
Luckily, interference was declared 
on the play so that Tech had the 
ball on the Covenanter 15 with a 
first down. Fritz passed tp John­
son on the next play, Johnson being 
stopped on the three. A pass play 
was broken up, but Philllpch.uk on 
two line plunges at center went 
over for the Tartans’ only score.
Henry Holets was rather badly 
beaten up in the game Saturday, 
but he will be in the Case game 
next Friday night. With Tech’s ap­
parent tendency to play better 
against overwhelming odds, we may 
well hope for a much better show­
ing against the Rough Riders next 
Friday.

As the Intramural football season 
started so it must end, but need­
less to say in a more sparkling fash­
ion. Even though several games 
remain to be played, the champion­
ship “round robin” will take place 
this week. These games that re­
main have no bearing on the out­
come of the leagues.
The Delts took on the lads of Mc­
Gill yesterday. Again the Delts 
tangle with the DU’s on .Wednes­
day. On. Monday of next week DU 
oppose§ McGill. As you can see 
each winner get a crack at the 
other or each team plays two games. 
If any one team succeeds in win­
ning both games it will be declar­
ed the winner and champ of the 
school. But in the case that each 
team wins one game, these teams 
hope that the championship will be 
split up. That is, for winning any 
league the winning team will be 
awarded 100 points toward the In­
tramural cup. And for winning 
the school championship that team 
will be awarded 200 points.
The desire of these teams is that 
while they each receive 100 points 
for winning their league, they want 
to split up the 200 points three 
ways in case of a three way tie. This 
set up has not yet received the 
green light of the Intramural board 
so it remains in the hopeful state. 
Just exactly what the proceedure 
will be wili be determined by the 
board at its next meeting.
As mentioned before the teams 
which will compete for the honors 
will be the Delts, Du’s and McGill 
Hall. The Delts have come through 
their schedule without a loss. At

times their blocking has not been 
as good as their opponents but 
their passing has more than made 
up the difference. The heighth of 
their boys has opened'the way for 
high passes that the other boys 
can’t touch.
Then a great many of their passes 
go to their center who seems to 
take the ball under the defenders 
hands, because he is built so close 
to the ground. This center in the 
person of Tom Durbin has more 
than held the Delt team together.
The DU’s are a well rounded 
team, although their passer, Dieker, 
flings a mean pill and connects bet­

year. Their plays are a little trick­
ier than the other championship 
team and keep the defense on its 
toes. The speed of this team will 
be a match for the heighth of the 
Delts.
McGill Hall has come from the 
obscure of last year to the finalists 
of today. Dick Bundy, one of the 
best receivers in the league, will 
be in there snagging ’em and pull­
ing his team along with a great deal 
of fight, if any of the past games 
are a criterion. This team is the 
definite surprise team of the sea­
son. They stand as good a chance 
as either of the other teams to come 
from the playoffs with the honors.

Season Opener 
Proves Successful 
For Soccer Players
On Wednesday, the twenty-sec­
ond of October the Freshman Soc­
cer Team held the Western Penn­
sylvania Institute for the Deaf to a 
1-1 tie. The Freshman played a 
good game all the way through the 
contest and for two overtime pe­
riods. They were come what handi­
capped, as usual, by an extremely 
muddy field and also, due to the 
fact that they had never played 
together in a game before last Wed­
nesday’s encounter. The Plebes 
played a much better game during 
the second half, after they became 
accustomed to playing together.
Somewhat significant is the fact 
that this. .3'Wthe • first time in • the last 
few years that the plebes have even 
tied the W. P. I. D. squad. If the 
present Freshman team continues 
playing as well as they did last 
Wednesday, Tech should be favored 
with an outstanding team in the 
next few years.
No score was made at all during 
the first half; however, W. P. I. D. 
kept the ball close to the Techites 
goal most of the time. It v as prob­
ably due to many “saves’’ by goalie 
Shewood that kept the opposing 
team from /scoring. In the - third 
quarter, however, W. P. I. D. broke 
through to score their only point. 
Then in the fourth quarter the 
Techites retaliated when Rendle- 
man scored a point. When the final' 
whistle blew the score was tied so 
a five minute overtime was played. 
Since no score was made in this 
overtime, another was called and 
since neither team was able to 
break through this time, the game 
was called a tie.
Those playing on Wednesday 
were: *
Shewood .................................... Goal
Danlals..........................Right fullback
Algor ........................... Left fullback

game was rescheulecl to this Tues­
day due to rain. On Friday the 
team travels to Oberlin.

4THE CABNEGIE TAETANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1941
nOetfuOa(¿'Fhh¿ah
of the causes and effects aspect' of 
the party held October 11, a few 
words can be written.' apropos this 
function and though they may 
have a tendency to cause offense, 
none is meant, however, and the 
statements, if judged in the light 
of fairness, are offered by way of 
suggestions with the hope of cor­
recting a disquieting situation.
Reference is made to some of the 
impromptu addresses and remarks 
made at the election. It would 
seem that those who attended this 
affair were given a verbal lacing 
for their supposed lack of inter­
est whereas the reverse should be 
the case. Those who were present 
certainly did not need, the quasi 
"pep talk” which they heard—rather 
(hey should have been commended 
and encouraged for coming out 
in the face of discouraging ele­
ments. Those who1 Avere there did 
riot need to be told that “if and so 
and so" it will be "so and so”—• 
blah—blah—'blah—blah. This at­
tack should be aimed at and told 
Id those who were not there.
Those students who came out did 
not come out to hear a verbal bar­
rage of meaningless words or to be 
harangued \Vith this, that, and the 
other thing, and in the end almost 
insulted. A large number of stu­
dents evidently disagreed with the 
talks since they left before ex­
ercising their prerogative—that of 
voting.
Number of Candidates
If candidates did not want to run 
for office, that was their concern 
and it was not necessary for others 
to perform the almost ludicrous and 
larcial play which was enacted. 
Surely, the persons involved, upon 
sober reflection, can see the folly of 
it. If there were a shortage of can­
didates desiring to run for office, 
that was not cause to hurl accusa­
tions at the assemblage.
When one reflects that it took 
more than one hour to secure 
nominations for the first group of 
officers, and a much longer time 
to complete the slates, by the time 
the voting was done there were 
only a few left in each group; most 
of those present had left with a 
sour discordant note struck. It is 
hoped that ‘the happenings of the 
election party will not be repeated 
next year.
In order that a more complete 
picture of the situation may be 
presented, and a full discussion had, 
more details will be submitted in 
future issues of the college paper, 
but suffice it to say now, that it is 
the earnest desire and hope of the 
writer that renewed interest may 
be instilled in the evening student 
body.
plans for decorating the Gym in the 
Hallowe’en theme, and would like 
to see a number of new workers 
out to help them put these plans 
into effect. The decorating period 
is on Saturday afternoon only, so 
the more workers out, the lighter 
the work will: be for all concerned. 
If you are unable to attend Satur­
day afternoon, the Sunday after­
noon clean-up period affords an­
other opportunity to earn points 
which will: ‘be credited toward an 
Insignia Award.
Then too, the people you meet 
arc really swell, and many life­
long friendships have been formed 
through these meetings.

Vocationals To Hold 
Social Function in 
Gym on Nov. 1st
As promised in last week’s edi­
tion, final arrangements have been 
made for the first dance to be held 
by the Evening College of Indus­
tries next Saturday, November 1, in 
the large Gymnasium, and the com­
mittee promises all who attended a 
good time.
Stan" Vinton’s orchestra,, one of 
the up and coming outfits in the 
Pittsburgh area, has been engaged 
to play for this affair, and all of 
you who’liked Jerry Grey are sure 
to enjoy th:e music of this presenta­
ble yoUng! man who was recom­
mended by the same person who 
brought Jerry Grey to the atten­
tion of Industries last year. Mr. 
Vinton has a large following 
among the college students of West­
ern Pennsylvania, having" been well 
received by the students of Wash­
ington & Jefferson and Waynes- 
burg i*ecently.
The firpt two hundred ladies to
arrive wili be rewarded with a
corsage "of fall flowers, and you
can be assured' they are worth re­
ceiving;
The Black Cat will be open that 
evening for those who wish refresh­
ments .or soft drinks between
dances.
Admission, as usual, is by regis­
tration card for members of College 
of Industries, and only one dollar 
per couple for others.

To Students
Discord Arises 
At Election Party
It seems that the recent election 
party held for the purpose of select­
ing officer» for the three component 
colleges of the Evening classes has 
been the cause of considerable dis­
cussion among groups on the cam­
pus. Some are of the opinion that 
it was a funny election, others felt 
that more interest could have been 
shown, and still others take an 
apathetic attitude with the cus­
tomary shrug of the shoulder and 
pass it on.
Much can be said no matter 
which viewpoint one has a mind to 
select, but in the final analysis it 
will have to be admitted that some 
good can come as a result of this 
party, for interest has been arous­
ed in campus activities and if well 
directed, when the end of the term 
rolls by, a decided improvement is 
bound to be noticed.
It is not very easy to place a 
finger on any specific cause for the 
lackadaisical spirit which was man­
ifested since there is no set math­
ematical rule of thumb method to be 
employed whereby results may be 
observed and judged. The activi­
ties are faced with that all evasive 
Human Equation element and those 
in charge of any function are con­
fronted with the problem—have we 
done the best we couldi under the 
circumstances—and herein lies the 
crux of the problem.
Pep Talk
Before taking up a short analysis
October 24, 1941.
Dear Old Timer:
As members of last year’s Council we greatly appreciate your con­
structive criticisms aired in the Plaid last week, and regret that we do not 
know your name so that we could hear more of these gems of wisdom.
You thoroughly lambasted last year’s Council, and we probably de­
serve it, but you are not giving us much consideration. In the first place 
it was an entirely new council last year. No old members with previous 
experience were on Council to help us along the way, and we followed 
pretty much the .traditions set up in the past (or so we thought until we 
read your enlightening document). The social calendar made up by the 
previous Council) was adhered to. According to the best traditions we 
advertised in the paper, we put notices on all the available bill board 
space, giving the students ample time, but advertising two or more dances 
at the same time—incidentally Old Timer, the dances were spaced approx­
imately two weeks apart—and mentioned it to all our friends and class­
mates.
If Old Timer will check his facts, he Will find that Election' Party 
and the “Get-Acquainted” Dance which he dubs as a “hopeless example” 
were two of the best.advertised.affairs held by Council. . Individual cards 
were given to the registrants two nights pf the registration period, and 
notices were handed out in Industries Hall two nights by members of last 
year’s inefficient, resting Council. Oh yes, the Plaid Editor had a really 
swell write-up boosting the affaiv too.
After thoroughy demoralizing Council you complain. of the lack of 
student cooperation; the inability to get students to run for office. The 
treatment received by the individual interested enough to run for office at 
the Election Party certainly would not induce any faint-hearted, timid 
aspirant to try for office. These people were accused of being petty poli­
ticians, and almost openly accused of macing any possible opposition.
Yes, Old Timer, we greatly appreciate your constructive criticisms, 
and your good1 intentions, but we would like to know how many points did 
you earn last year? How many of our affairs did you attend and make a
• success? What did you do to help Council last year? You know, the 
brightest moments are dulled by repetition. Maybe you are Satiated?
Sincerely yours

Emergency
Defense priorities, the draft, and 
wedding bells have hit Carnegie 
Tech. The enrollment figures show 
a decrease in three colleges—Voca­
tional, Arts, and Maggie Murph; An 
increased enrollment of new stu­
dents in the College of Engineering 
has offset the large group that is 
now taking the course in Applied 
Military Science in dear old U. S. 
army.
Many College of Vocational stu­
dents are working through the night 
and enrollment has dropped from
1,329 last year to 1,099 this year. 
The College of Fine Arts has 439 
students as against last year’s 465. 
Registration in Margaret Morrison 
totals 76 as compared with 86 last 
year. This year’s College of En­
gineering enrollment is 1,205, an 
increase over last’s 1,167.
