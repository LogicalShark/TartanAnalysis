‘THE GONDOLIERS’ 
AT MUSIC HALL
Operetta Presents Rare Op­
portunity to Pitts­
burghers
AID TO STUDENTS
Art School Departments Pre­
sent Play Wednesday 
and Thursday
"The Gondoliers,” ;t Gilbert and 
Sullivan operetta, will be presented 
in Carnegie Music. Hall on Wednes­
day and Thursday evenings, April 
6 and 7, respectively, for the estab­
lishment of a Student Aid Fund in 
the departments of Music and 
Drama, Proceeds of the two benefit 
performances will be used to enable 
deserving students of talent to con­
tinue their education.
The, operetta, also known as “The 
King of Barataria,” was first pro­
duced in London, in 1889, and ran 
554 consecuVivc performances. It is 
considered England’s most popular 
work, and according to critics1 is 
without parallel among the series of 
Gilbert and Sullivan operettas for 
sheer atmosphere. Sullivan used Italian 
and Spanish motifs in the serenades, 
dances and ballads; his songs were 
skillfully worded by the sparkling 
Gilbert.
“The Gondoliers,” the eleventh 
operetta Written in collaboration by 
Gilbert and Sullivan, concluded the 
twenty-one. years of partnership of 
England’s most prolific light opera 
composers. The story concerns twin 
gondoliers, who on their wedding day 
arc called to rule jointly as king of 
the mythical island of Barataria until 
it can be determined who is the right­
ful heir. There is a complication :n 
that Casiida, daughter of* the Duke 
of Pla/.a-Toro, had been betrothed 
tol the infant king when only six 
months old. A hopeless tangle ensues, 
ty't'.til'P story ends happily, in the 
Mst Gilbert and Sullivan manner.'
/Miss Jean Seaman arid Matthew 
Fjrcy arc directing the production; j. 
Vic O’Brien is directing the orchestra.

Seriously 
Speaking
A COLUMN OF CURIOUS COMMENT 
BY NATHAN MILLER
Ye Troubadors
A new race of popular herpes 
has arisen. Perhaps they are even 
akin to the minor gods. We allude 
of course, to the maestros of the 
baton, the crooners, and assorted 
dictators of jazz.
¦ Each of these worthy young 
gentlemen has attached to himself 
throughout the length and. breadth 
of the land an enormous and de­
voted following who hang and pant 
tqion every shrill caophony he may 
emit. The "fans” swoon in delight 
as Bing Crosby, Guy Lumbardo, 
the inimitable Rudy or Paul White­
man croaks hoarsely or whinnies 
fetchingly while the brasses blare 
and the strings moan. What magic 
sounds and what feats of the musi­
cal imagination cannot these mas­
ters wring out of tin-pan alley 1 
¦, Apparently these estimable' fig­
ures command a huge respect be­
cause we read of the amazingly 
grand homage paid to them in the 
high prices paid for their services. 
, Checks running into the four fig- 
, urcs (drawn upon the few remain­
ing solvent banks, at that) repre­
sent the sacrificial offerings that 
arc paid *to them and their orclies- 
\tras divine. Glancing at college 
papers, it strikes one that the chief 
activity among college organiza­
tions is vicing for the favors of 
one of these troubadors by bidding 
up the ante until the fraternities 
have mortgaged all they own. The

Thistle Hall At 
Dance
The Interfraternity Sing Contest, 
in which all fraternities and dormi­
tories are eligible to enter teams, 
will be held Friday, April 1 in the 
gymnasium at 7:30 p. m. Entrants 
must submit a list of the members 
of their respective teams to J. C. 
Horning not later than tomorrow.
The gymnasium, which was selected 
in order that the crowd might be con­
veniently accommodated, will be laid 
out in a U-shaped seating arrange­
ment with the bleachers forming the 
U and chairs filling the inner section. 
A new, two-tiered stage with a 
canopy to improve the acoustics will 
be situated at the head of the U 
on the Park Mansions side of the 
gymnasium. The stage, which was 
purchased for use in Thistle Hall, 
has its two levels adjusted in such 
a manner as to provide the teams 
with adequate facilities for voice ar­
rangement. A piano will be on the 
platform for the use of those teams 
who wish accompaniment.
The leaders of the teams will ap­
pear at the “Y” office at a time to be 
designated later to draw for places 
for their order of appearance. A 
program will be distributed at the 
9ontest with the names of the various 
teams and their orders of a^pearan)be. 
The teams, which are required to be 
in formal attire, will form off-stage 
wliefi they are called by the an­
nouncer and will march in a body 
to the platform. Here they will be 
given only six minutes' in which to 
complete their programs and will be 
expected to leave the stage, promptly 
at the end of this, period.,
Formal attire for the spectators, 
although not compulsory, is encourg- 
cd. There will be no admission charge 
to the gymnasium, fraternities being 
charged a registration fee of probably 
one dollar to cover the cost of 
programs and decorations.

ruling of the Intcrfraternity Council

Spring Carnival Committee 
To Hold Meeting Today
> The first meeting of the Spring Carnival Committee will be held today at 12:30 in the Faculty Dining Room in the Inn.

Dr. Schoen 
Writes Book
‘Art and Beauty” ' Deals 
With Artist and 
His Work
"But I have not written for critics.
I have written for iriyself and for 
those who seek to understand rather 
than to judge.”
With these heartening words Dr. 
Max Schoen opens the clearest and 
most interesting discussion of that 
nebulous land of esthetics,' "Art arid 
Beauty.” The little blue and silver 
volume which has just been issued by 
Macmillan will prove a decided boon 
to the heretofore puzzled layman— 
which means Maggie Murphcnic and 
engineers—and clear up many a ques­
tion as to the why and wherefore 
and how of the artist -and his work. 
It fills a long-felt need for a textbook 
on esthetics that is comprehensible to 
the ordinary student.
Dr. Schoen is poncerncd with three 
aspects of his subject: The nature 
and objective of .esthetics; the rela­
tion of the artist to his art work'and 
the nature of that work; and an 
illuminating discussion of art and the 
layman. Instead of treating the mat 
ter in the erudite njanner of the old 
philosophers and learned men of the 
ages, lie makes of the experience of 
beauty in art a very personal thing, 
important and. vital to all of us. In 
terms of the ordinary man’s cxpcri 
cncc he talks of the nature of these 
things which have heretofore been 
granted exclusively to the “elite” and 
the “critics.”
For over 14 years Dr. Schocn has 
been gathering the material for this 
book, and the result is a group of 
cssa3rs that every college student and 
lover of art will find exciting in 
presentation and discovery.

Council Approves 
Dorm. Petition
The petition of( the Dormitory 
Council that the date of. the Men’s 
Boat Ride be changed to May 6 
was approved at the last meeting 
of the Student Council. The date 
formerly set conflicted with the 
dates appointed for the annual 
Spring Carnival.
The petition of the Short-Course 
students that they may be allowed 
a non-voting representative on 'Stu­
dent Council was refused. It was 
decided that, since the Short-Course 
students were allowed to have rep­
resentation in the Industries Sen­
ate, they were automatically repre­
sented on the Student Council. The 
motion was carried that Student 
Council should supervise the elec­
tion of the Short-Course student.
Petitioners for the office of 
treasurer of the Engineering’ Sen­
ate who were approved by the 
election committee of the Student 
Council are: William H. Council!, 
Lawrence F. Dickson, Roy L. 
Grant, Melvin L. Jones and Robert 
E. Robinson. The election for 
treasurer of the Engineering Sen­
ate, a junior position, -will be held 
in the hall of the .College of En­
gineering Tuesday, March 22, from 
11:30 to 1:30. All students in the 
College of Engineering, with the 
exception of freshman, may vote in 
this election.
The candidate elected to office 
will, because of a recent vacancy, 
serve as an assistant treasurer of 
the Student Council in addition to 
being treasurer of Engineering Sen-?

with -the treasurer of Arts’ Sen?

Tartan Staff Meeting
There will be a special meeting of 
all senior and junior staff members 
at the Tartan make-up office at 
1:00 p. m. tomorrow.
“Not So Romantic,” Says Captain
Hamilton of French Foreign Legion
"Gangway! Here come the Le- 
gionaires!”
Independent, desperate men are 
those of the French Foreign Le­
gion. They are men who have 
led unhappy or reckless civilian 
lives and have come up against a 
blank wall. In angry dissatisfac­
tion they then join the Legion. As 
Captain Edgar Hamilton, former 
Carnegie student and only Ameri­
can officer in the Legion, express­
ed, ' "they are men who,' in this 
country, jump off five-story build­
ings. In France they joint the 
Legion.
Life Is Not Romantic
"Life in the Legion is hard,” 
Hamilton explained, “and many 
men regret they join it. It is easy 
to enlist—no questions are asked 
and no oath is taken, except to 
agree to serve five years. Once 
you sign your papers you are in, 
and God Almighty can’t get you 
out.”
Captain Hamilton, who considers 
himself as “an old Tech student 
gone wrong,” apologized for stray­
ing to the faculty and students 
who were present at the Military 
Smoker last Tuesday. Even though 
his job is so totally different from’ 
those which, most Carnegie stu­
dents follow, he has. vowed to re­
turn to the Legion as 'soon as his 
leave is ended.

Improvements to Be Made 
in Thistle Hall For 
Senior Dance
Men “Slightly Crazy”
‘‘But an officer although he has 
hardships, monotony and occasional 
fighting, does not lead as empty 
a life as the men. There is affec­
tion of your s|oldiers, prestige, offi­
cers are fairly ‘well paid, there Is 
wine, good food, freedom—and no 
one interferes with your life w'hen 
you are off duty.
“I suppose we’re all a trifle 
cracked; the life is so different
from any other that you would 
expect the men and officers to be 
somewhat odd. It is an interesting 
problem in psychology to handle a 
company of men who are all
slightly crazy.”
Commit Suicide? Sure! 
Captain Hamilton employed unique 
methods of destroying fallacies
concerning the Legion. Consider 
how he handled suicide cases in 
the Legion:
“Once a month or so a man
comes in and threatens to com­
mit suicide. There isn’t anything 
an officer can do about that—if a 
man wants to commit suicide, he 
wilk What of it? There is no 
place in the Legion for a weakling. 
If you’re yellow, keep out. No­
body asks you to join.
“But to some the life is unbear­
able, and since jrou cannot resign 
or buy your way out, the only 
(Continued on Page 3)
Several new courses will be intro­
duced into the curriculum of the 
Printing Department next year. Two 
years of German will be placed 
among the required subjects for the 
sophomore and junior years, ele­
mentary German and • intermediate 
scientific German, C-221, Cr222 .and 
C-235-236, being the required sub­
jects. The students who have had 
the elementary course in German will 
be able to begin with the advanced 
coursc. It is felt that the addition 
of this language will not only prove 
beneficial in a cultural way but will 
also provide the printers with a 
sufficient knowledge of the language 
to enable them to gain access to 
scientific writings on chemistry deal­
ing with printing.
With these additions to the sched­
ule, several other courses have been 
dropped from the required list. 
Economic districts- of the United 
States and applied psychology have 
been omitted from the sophomore 
year. Advanced machine composition 
has been omitted, and machine com­
position has been postponed to the 
junior year.
The second semester of survey of 
the printing industry has been re­
moved to rnake way for the addition 
of the history of printing in the sec­
ond semester of the junior year.
Other changes in the printing cur­
riculum will include public speaking, 
a nine-unit coursc, which jj.vill be 
added to the requirements of the 
senior year; advanced English for

W. A. A. To Hold 
Swimming Party
The . Women’s Athletic Association 
will sponsor a mixed swimming party 
in the gymnasium pool on Saturday, 
April 2/from 8 to 10 o’clock. The 
tickets, which are'limited in number, 
will be 35- cents a person and 50 
cents a couple.
Aquatic performances will be fea­
tured in the evening’s program. Der- 
land Johnson, champion high-board 
and low-board diver of the Allegheny 
Mountain Association, and Genevieve 
Vogel, also well-known divers, will 
present a diving exhibition. . Mem­
bers of the swimming teams will 
also perform.
Bridge tables will be arranged at 
one side of the pool for; those who 
prefer playing bridge to swimming. 
The Women’s Athletic Association 
will use the proceeds of the affair 
towards purchasing an outing cabin.
Unique Puppet Issue 
On Sale Wed., April 6
On Wednesday, April 6, a very 
unusual and unique number of the 
Puppet will be placed on sale, ac­
cording to Editor-in-Chief Har­
vey A. Collins.
For some time the Puppet staff 
has been laying plans for the April 
issue, and staff members state that 
this issue, will be unusual in more 
way than one. All of Puppet’s old 
and established traditions have 
been disregarded in planning for 
the April issue. An element of 
mystery surrounds all of the plans. 
Staff members have been admon­
ished not- to divulge any informa' 
tion about the contents.
The circulation manager acclaims 
that one of Puppet's long'estab­
lished precedents has been entirely 
disregarded so that it will be pos­
sible for every student to obtain a 
Puppet. “It’ll be something new 
and different,” are. his exact words.
The Senior Ball, presented by 
the class of 1932, will be held, in 
Thistle Hall' on the evening of 
Friday, April 15, from 9 until 2. 
The orchestra engaged for that 
evening is Jean Goldkette’s Casa 
Loma Orchestra under the direc­
tion of Hank Biagani. This first 
class dance band has played at 
Washington and Lee College func­
tions, at the Pitt Ball for the West 
Point Cadets last fall, and at the 
Detroit Jay Hop. The band is 
regularly presented over the Co­
lumbia Broadcasting System; it has 
had runs at the Showboat in Pitts­
burgh, and at hotels in Houston, 
Texas; it was presented to the 
Prince of Wales as the perfect
American dance orchestra.
The Senior Ball Committee con­
sists of members of the senior
class representing the four col­
leges. The presidents of the classes 
in the respective colleges are: Jane 
Elizabeth Croylc, Margaret Mor­
rison Carnegie College, who has 
charge of inviting the patrons and 
patronesses; Harvey A. Collins,
College of Industries, who is chair­
man and who is handling the pro­
grams; Willard C. Holloway, Col­
lege of Engineering, who has charge 
of the tirkets; Samuel K.' Wilson,- 
College of Fine Arts, who is pub­
licity agent.
Tickets will be on sale at the 
"Y” office in the College of In­
dustries, or they may be obtained 
from any member of the committee 
or from any Dragon. The tax is 
$4, which represents a $1 cut on 
the price of last year's tickets.
In an attempt to make Thistle 
Hall more attractive, a new band­
stand will be erected, it is hoped, 
in time for the Ball. Drapes will

Urge Seniors To Act Now
Employment Bureau Has 
List of Prospective 
Companies
The Bureau of Recommendations 
urges all those of the senior classes 
who- are interested in securing em­
ployment upon graduation to make 
the best use possible of the coming 
Easter vacation as a time to inter­
view prospective employers, and to 
secure information regarding possible 
employment in their chosen field or 
in any temporary line that they could 
follow.
The -bureau has a large number of 
names of companies in all fields 
which are available for the use of 
the student body.
Because of general business condi­
tions the securing of positions this 
year is going to be a very difficult 
matter, and consequently “no stone 
should be left unturned” in attempt­
ing to secure work. The few jobs 
that will be filled this year are going 
to those who act early.
Sculptural Pesigns 
Receive Awards
The Beaux Arts Institute of Design 
at New York City, in its recent judg­
ment, awarded Mentions to five Car­
negie Tech students for their sculp- 
tural designs submitted in the com 
petition of March 7. The members 
of the Department of Sculpture who 
received recognition -were Gladys 
Bcamer ’32, Edith Barnes Sp., Kath­
erine McSwigan Sp,, Raymond Bar­
ger ’32, and John Lisotto ’32.
The problem to be executed by the 
students was an equestrian group of 
a ljjonumental type, to. be placed at 
the entrance of a large public park. 
The subject for the group which the 
competitor was to design was "Peace” 
and contained a horse and rider as 
well as several figures with suitable 
accessories for the title.
These regular competitions are held 
monthly by the Eeaux Arts Institute 
and only those students registered in 
the Institute may take part in ^them. 
All the leading art schools in the 
country have students enrolled as 
competitors.
SENIORS LEAD HONORS
Perfect Semester Records Are 
Made By Five 
Students
One hundred and seventy students, 
representing seven per cent of an 
enrollment of 2,397, have been cited 
for honors on the basis of grades for 
the first semester 1931-1932 accord­
ing to an announcement» from the 
office of the Registrar.
This total represents an increase 
of 36 over that of the first semester 
of last year when 134 were named

East erRTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, MARCH 22, 1932,
Varsity and Froshmon Track 
Candidato* Report to 
tho Field House This Aftornoon.TARTAN SPORTS PAGE
Intramural Basketball Play-Off 
Tonight; Intramural 
Swimming Meet, April !.
WHETHER THE TRACK SEASON AT CARNEGIE 
will cxpcricncc, crcditablc results or not will depend largely 
upon the progress which is made within the next few weeks. 
The practices to date have been poorly attended, and Coach 
Guy Iialferty wishes to impress both varsity and freshmen can­
didates with the fact that they must report at once in order to 
be considered for the coming competition.
Only two weeks remain to train for the initial P. A. A. meet 
on April 16. Performances in these events will determine the 
make-up of the team that takes the trips to Cincinnati and then 
to Western Reserve on succeeding Saturdays.* * * *
AT THE PRESENT RATE OF ELECTING CAPTAINS 
the Plaid teams of next year will be literally overrun with leader­
ship. Bob Smith and Jim Fergus have joined the ranks of the co­
basketball captains, and will lead Carnegie’s basketball aspirations 
next season in the dual role. The co-leaders of the court weije 
the result of a deadlock in the voting of the letter men.
There’s no doubt that either of these players could lead a 
team with equal success, and their co-election is a tribute to 
their play of the last two years. From their method of play, 
it is obvious that both baskets will be well attended in the 
future games, for Smith leads the attack while Fergus is the 
mainstay of the defense.
* * * *
THE FIRST INTERCOLLEGIATE BOXING CONFER­
ENCE held last weekend went off in fine style as far as the 
boxers were concerned, but the surprisingly small number of
spectators was no tribute to the efforts that were extended to
put this competition across. West Virginia will handle next 
year’s tournament in Morgantown, with the same schools com­
peting.
Although Temple toted home the handsome trophy, they 
scored but one win in the finals, while Bucknell garnered two 
titles. The Owls gained their winning points in the semi-final 
round where three runners-up added nine points as compared 
with three points for the Bisons in the second-place count. Du- 
quesne’s boxers accomplished more than was expected, being 
rewarded with a close third place in the tournament.
If there is any thought of awarding a medal for the best 
form and class, our friend “Hill-Billy” Hawkins, the moonlight 
of the Mountaineers, should cop the honors with a wide margin. 
After he has correctly planted that “chew” in his jaw, he as­
sumes the attitude of an experienced fighter who actually doe's 
take’m as well as leave’m.
As for Carnegie’s participation in the tournament, the least 
that can be said is that the three entries did very well consider­
ing the two-year existence of Skibo boxing.* * # *
FROM THE WHOOPS AND BOOI-IOOES of experi­
enced “kibitzers” that have been directed at close decisions in 
the recent boxing bouts, an innocent bystander would get the 
impression that the referee and judges were dealing out some 
jyreat wrong, whereas the officials arc merely performing their 
duty as outlined by the amature boxing rules. It so happens 
that Mr. Simon Carlson of IJniontown has patiently borne the, 
brunt of these attacks while refereeing in the Carnegie Gym 
these last few weeks.
THE I'LAID SCREEN takes this opportunity to present 
Mr. Carlson’s views on this subject with the hope that those 
who doubt future decisions will think twice before doing so. 
Mr. Carlson has followed the ring game for more than thirty- 
live years, taking the part of boxer or referee. During his serv­
ile in the Army, which includes the Spanish-Amcrican War and 
the World War, he has served as instructor and refereed more 
than 50,000 fights.
Mr, Carlson lists the items for scoring points as clean hil­
ling, aggressiveness, cleverness, knockdowns, and fouls. Of the 
fourteen possible fouls, these arc the ones which spectators often 
overlook, holding an opponent or deliberately maintaining a 
clinch, hitting with the inside of the hand, flicking with the 
open glove, hitting with one hand and holding with the other, 
striking an opponent on the back of the neck, and failure to 
obey the referee.
It is therefore evident that a boxer might hit his opponent 
a greater number of times and still loose the decision, for the 
same man could foul his opponent enough times to counter­
balance his margin gained by a fair offense.
A college boxing audience should be so educated in the 
above points that they can enjoy three rounds of fast technical 
boxing instead of a sl’ug-fest.* * * *
POTENT POINTS IN THE INTRAMURAL BASKET­
BALL struggle will be definitely settled tonight by the Kappa 
Sig’s and Englebrecht Hall. The fact that both teams have yet 
to meet defeat is reason enough for a hard fought game.
Intramural Competition To Begin
In Swimming, Soft Ball, Wrestling
With a lull in varsity activities, 
Intramural sports will monopolize 
the stage for the nex.t few weeks. 
Definite plans are in the air to bring 
swimming, wrestling, and soft ball 
within the reach of a hundred or 
more students.
Swimming 
With a br;md new cup for the 
winners, the swimming meet will pro­
vide an afternoon of keen competi­
tion on April 1. All entries for the 
meet must be in Mr. Riscdorph's 
hands by Wednesday, • March 23. 
Swimmers must be clad in swimming 
suits as has been the custom for the 
past two years. The cup must be won 
three times by the same organization 
before it may bccomc their perman­
ent possession.
Wrestling 
Wrestling is next on the card. It 
has been decided that a team of but 
four men will represent each com­
peting group. The teams will be 
classified as representing fraternity, 
dormitory, or individual groups. A 
meeting of representatives of all the 
organizations who wish to enter will 
be held Tuesday, March 29, in the
First Church of Christ

of vital importance that every com­

meeting as it is here that the de­
tails of the tournament will be work­
ed out. Entries close Friday, April 1, 
at 4:30. As this is the first time that 
Intramural wrestling has been at­
tempted at Carnegie, it is hoped that 
much interest will be shown in the 
new sport.
Soft Ball 
It won't be long until the urge 
to play ball seizes the Carnegie ball 
and bat enthusiasts. Plans arc already 
growing for the coming Intramural 
soft ball campaign. The tentative date 
for a meeting of the representatives 
of the organizations sponsoring soft 
ball teams has been set as April 5. 
Rules and plans for soft ball com­
petition will be discussed in detail at 
that time.

TEMPLE WINNER 
IN FIRST BOXING 
TOURNAMENT
Enthusiastic Crowds Watch 
Clever Mittmen From 
Seven Schools
Enthusiasm ran high in the Car­
negie Tech Gymnasium last weekend 
when the Tartan school played host 
to the mittslingcrs of seven leading 
eastern universities and colleges. The 
crowd was not exceptionally large, 
but it made up for its lack of size 
by its powerful lung capacity. This 
was the first meeting of the recently 
organized Eastern Intercollegiate Box­
ing Conference.
High honors for the meet w;re 
annexed by a classy Temple squad 
from Philadelphia with a total of 
sixteen points; Bucknell finished sec­
ond with twelve points; and an under­
rated Duqucsnc team annexed third 
place with eleven. The Owl team 
placed men in the finals in every 
division they entered, taking two 
firsts and two seconds. Wash-JelT, 
West Virginia, Pitt,, and Carnegie 
Tech brought up the rear, the four 
of them having their scores Closely 
bunched a long way behind the 
leaders.
Skibos Lose
The Tartans hopes were bidlv 
shattered the first night, when Wald­
ron ran into one of Hawkin’s highly 
touted right crosses and Wertz lost 
a close decision to Vitula of Du- 
qucsne. Referee Carlson voted in 
favor of Wertz, but the judges saw 
it otherwise. The remaining Carnegie 
candidate, Captain Henry .Carr, lost 
in the finals to Freddie Moore, the 
Duke captain.
Probably the two most finished 
boxers in the tournament were 
D’Alessandro, Temple 115 pounder, 
and Hawkins, West Virginia's heavy­
weight sensation. Both, these boys 
gave smooth exhibitions of snappy 
footwork and seemed to hit hard 
with both hands. Vitulla, Duquesne 
midget, gave the Temple boxer a 
great contest, but lie lacked the ex­
perience necessary to cope with such 
a finished performer.
Schrickcr Wins
The aggressiveness of Jack 
Schrickcr, Pitt captain, seemed to 
catch the eye of the officials, for lie 
was handed decisions on both nights 
even though lie did absorb consider­
ably more than his share of the 
punches. "Red’’ Wilkinson, Bucknell 
(lash, consistantly beat off his furious 
attacks in the semi-finals and gave 
the Panther fighter a real boxing 
lesson, but he got little credit for 
his efforts. Likewise, Captain Kutchcr, 
a consistant Owl winner, found that 
it was nccpssary to knock a Pitt 
man out to win in Pittsburgh. 
Kutchcr had the fight under control 
all the way, but his holding and rab­
bit-punching tactics received little 
sympathy from the officials. Boos 
greeted both decisions, but Referee 
Carlson has been booed so often in 
the Skibo ring that it has ceased to 
annoy him.
Next Tourney at W. Va.
West Virginia has been appointed 
host to the next tournament, which 
will probably be held around the 
same date next year.
It is evident that the Pittsburgh 
fight fans have not awakened to the 
entertainment value in intercollegiate 
boxing. Thrills seem to be as much 
present as they arc in the profes­
sional game, and the audience need 
not fear for fouls and dives on the 
part of the contestants. The crowd 
for both nights was not as large as 
such an important athletic event 
warrants.
ELECTION TODAY
(Continued from Page One) 
last Friday, March 18, in the Y. M. 
C. A. office, none were ceceived 
by the election committee. As 
there is a vacancy in this office 
which must be filled, another date 
on which the petitions will be due 
will be set by the election com­
mittee and posted.
Marksmen Place
Third At Cincinnati
Shooting last Saturday in the Na­
tional Intercollegiate Championship 
match, Carnegie placed third in its 
scction. The meet was held at Cin­
cinnati University with seven colleges 
attending, to make up one of the 
five sections in the national compe­
tition. Those colleges represented were 
Cincinnati U., Dayton U., Carnegie, 
Pitt, West Virginia, Kentucky U., and 
Fcnn College.
Cincinnati turned in a score of 
1,363 to take first place, and Dayton 
placed second with a 1,355 score.
Carnegie’s score of 1,336 was follow­
ed by Pitt’s 1,321 for ' third and
fourth places.
The Skibos aggregate score was 
made up of 484 points prone, 448 
kneeling, and 378 standing. Members 
of the team who made the. trip were 
Painter, Bcckcrt, Schcrba, Holloway 
and Dickson. Bcckcrt was'high man 
with a 276 out of a possible 300.
Telegraphic matchcs in the past 
two weeks have given- the marks­
men victories over Alabama Poly,
New York Stock' Exchange, Mis­
souri U., Gettysburg, Kansas State, 
and Georgetown.
Announcement was rcficntly made 
from headquarters of' the Third
Corps Area that Carnegie had quali­
fied in the Third Corps match. This 
gives them a place to fire in the Na­
tional R. O. T. C. match, ,in comr 
petition with colleges from all over 
the country. These matchcs and the 
Hcarst Trophy contest, which, is 
now being shot, will officially end the 
rifle season.
FINAL CALL FOR 
NEW TRACK MEN
Cinder Schedule is Announced. 
First Meet With P. A. A. 
Saturday, April 16
Along with the announcement of 
this year’s track schedule comes the 
final call for varsity and freshmen 
track and field candidates. With th.‘. 
first meet less than a month away, 
Coach Guy Iialferty' is anxious tp 
get all the athletes into shape for 
this encounter. Captain Tom Coulter 
again wishes to stress the fact that 
the individual's lack of experience 
should not influence his desire to 
compete in track as there arc many 
vacancics on the team and all aspir­
ants are urged to come out. The 
candidates should report immediately 
and get into condition for the first 
meet, as the performances there will 
determine which men will make the 
trips with the team.
The track schedule this spring will 
be one of the hardest ever under­
taken by Carnegie. The season opens 
on April 16 with the perennial prac­
tice meet with the Pittsburgh Athletic 
Association. The following Saturday 
the team journeys to Cleveland for 
an engagement with Western Reserve. 
On April 30 the traclcstcrs arc again 
on the road, this time appearing 
against the University of Cincinnati 
at the Ohio city.
On May 7 the home season is in­
augurated in the Bowl with W. & 
J. furnishing the opposition. Then 
Geneva will be met in Beaver Falls. 
The tentative date for this contest is 
May 14. The annual feud with Pitt 
will be resumed on May 17 and 
Temple will oppose the .Skibos for 
the first time on May 21. This is also 
a home contcst. In the finale, the 
Tartans meet Grove City on May 
26 in the Bowl.
Duquesne High Keeps 
Relay Championship
Duquesne High School’s crack 
swimming team retained the team 
championship in the third annual 
Carnegie Tech intcrscholastic swim­
ming relays. The Dukes finished far 
ahead of the field with a grand 
total of 15 points. Taylor Alderdice, 
Carrick, South, and Clairton tied for 
second with 5 points each. In winning, 
Duquesne lowered two relay records.
INTRAMURAL 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
GAME TONIGHT
Englebrecht and Kappa Sig’s 
Meet in Deciding Game 
in Gym At 8:30
The winner of the Intcrmural 
basketball championship play-offs will 
be dccidcd in the Gym tonight when 
Englcbrcch hall meets the Kappa 
Sigmas. Englebrecht Hall has already 
won' one of their play-off games 
when they defeated the Senior Archi­
tects on Thursday night by the score 
of 20-11.
The game tonight promises to be 
very close and exciting, for each 
team is very strong and each one 
has an untarnished record so far. 
Each team has won eight games 
without a defeat. In order to defray 
the expenses for the officials, an ad­
mission price of fifteen ccnts will be 
charged.
Federal League Decided
The winner of the Federal League 
was not decided until Monday night 
when the Kappa Sigmas played the 
Pi Kapa Alpha. Each teai.i has won 
seven games and each team went in­
to the game With the will to win. 
The Kappa Sigmas got the jump 
right at the beginning and had the
score at five to nothing before the
game had progressed very far. How­
ever at the half the score was
eleven to eight in .favor of the 
Kappa Sigmas. The third quarter 
was featured by the close guarding 
of each team. Neither team scored 
a point in this period. In the last 
period the Kappa Sigmas put on a 
spurt which enabled them to sew up 
the game. The final score was 18-11.
The Senior Architects after win­
ning- seven straight met a defeat in 
their last league game but still nad 
a high enough percentage to win. 
their league. The Delta Sigma 
Lambdas gave them their first de­
feat. The score was 22-20.
Englebrecht Defeats Architects
Englebrecht Hall had clear sailing 
in the American League after the 
first two'or three games and finished 
their schedule by trimming • McGill 
I-Iall 28t9. Thursday night Engle­
brecht met the Senior Architects and 
managed to crash through to a 20-11 
¡victory. The Architects minus the 
¡services: of Slade, their star per­
former, never forced the issue, being 
'continually behind. At the half the 
(score was 10-4 in favor of the Dorm 
)joys. The second half; was a little 
¡closer, but the Architects could not 
summon enough power to break 
'down their opponent's defense.
j Winners Meet Pitt 
; As the winners of the Pitt Intra­
mural league have not been, dccidcd 
as yet, no definite arrangements have 
been made for an inter-school cham­
pionship scries. However, it is almost 
certain that the winners in the two 
schools will get together soon after 
Easter vacation. There is an attempt 
being made to have tlicsc games held 
in the Tartan Gym.
The first new mark was 1:32.6 for 
the 150-yard medley, and a short 
time later another Crimson and White 
aggregation covered the 200-yard 
breaststroke distance in the record 
time of 2:22.2.
The mermen of Carrick and Lati­
mer tied for first place in the junior 
colnpctition. Only one new mark was 
hung up in this class, and again Du- 
quesnc claimed the honor. The fast 
time of 0:44.3 for the 75-yard medley 
accountcd for the record.
. In successfully defending their 
senior championship, Duquesne won 
the 200-yard free style, 200-jrard 
breaststroke and 150-yard mcdicy re­
lays. The other senior event, the 
200-yard backstroke relay, was taxen 
by Carrick in the fast time of 2:14.

Industry takes a hint 
from the kitchen
The domestic art of baking is closely par­
alleled in telephone manufacture at Western 
Electric, where plastic molding is an exact 
science.
Telephone bell boxes, for instance, are no 
longer formed of metal: They are molded 
from a phenol plastic compound—containing 
carbolic acid, formaldehyde and other ingre­
dients—because Western Electric manufac­
turing engineers saw the way to make a better
product at lower cost. These men developed 
a new and exceptionally efficient type of plas­
tic molding press —and determined precisely 
how long to bake the mixture and the exact 
temperature to use.
In quickly taking advantage of the new 
art of plastic molding, Bell System engineers 
once more showed that they have the kind 
of imagination that keeps American industry 
forging ahead.

A SECTION OF THE TARTAN DEVOTED TO THE NIGHT STUDENTS.
NIGHT COLLEGE OF- INDUS­TRIES SMOKER APRIL 2, GYMNASIUM.
SERIOUSLY SPEAKING
(Continued from Page One) 
memorable event at college is 
when the fur-coated, wavy-haired 
maestro and his gnomes uncork 
their wily compositions and go into 
their gymnastic performances.
Depressions mean nothing for 
this industry and by dint of crowd­
ing the air, clover press agency 
and “well-arranged and well-hintcd- 
at, scandals, another corner of the 
popular heart can be usurped for 
still another modern troubador. 
The music schools had better re­
vise the entire basis for their cur­
ricula and introduce courses in 
crooning, wise-cracking and broken- 
down instrumentation lest they be­
come mere museums. Millions of 
Americans cannot be altogether 
wrong; they insist on holding these 
hotel Apollos closer and closer to 
their hearts.
INTERFRATERNITY SING
(Continued from Page One) 
which states that fraternities must 
sing songs that have been approved 
by their national organization, the 
dormitories will now be limited in 
their selections to school songs. This 
has been done in order that competi­
tion wjll be placed on a fairer basis. 
The limits to the number of c6n-' 
testants per team have now been ex­
tended to between eight and sixteen 
men.
The judges for the contest will in­
clude: Dean Mary Watson Green, 
Glcndinning Kccble, Matthew Frey, 
Karl A. Malchcrck and James V. 
O’Brien; the three last named in the 
list being connectcd with the Music 
Department. The decision of the 
judges will be based on four , points, 
namely (1) quality of singing, (2) 
appeal of song's, (3) singing ability, 
and (4) appcarancc and promptness 
of the team.
The award will be presented to 
the winning team at the dance, which 
will be held.ip Thistle Hall after the 
contest. Will Ryshanek and his or­
chestra will provide the music for 
the dance continuously from 9 to 1.

At the dance the winning team and 
the team receiving first honorable- 
mention will be asked to broadcast 
over station WWSW. After the 
broadcast the award which is an 
eighteen inch cup will be presented to 
the winning team as a body.
The entrance to Thistle Hall from 
the gymnasium will be used by those 
attending the sing which is expected 
to be over by 10. For the convenience 
of those not attending the sing, the 
side entrance to the hall will be 
open from nine .o'clock on. The ad­
mission charge to the dance will be 
$1.00.
Invitations, to act as chaperones 
for the evening have been extended 
to: Mr. and Mrs. R(. V. Davis, Mr. 
and Mrs. A. E. Risedorph, and Mr. 
and Mrs. L. Ii. Miller.
And let’s have this election over 
soon this y.car so that we can get 
back to the dials to hear these mu­
sical worthies spiii out their 
alchemy from morn to eve, and 
over again.
In 1924 the Schcnlcy' Theater fea­
tured the Glee Clubs of TECH at' 
20-minute performances twice every 
night for the period of one week.
NOT SO ROMANTIC
(Continued from Page One) 
thing that is left frequently is 
suicide.
“So. when a man comes to me 
and says he is going to commit 
suicide, I agree. ‘Suicide? Fine! 
Here, use my gun I’ As a rule 1 
take the gun out of my desk draw­
er, put a bullet in it, and offer it 
to. the complainer. Usually, they 
forget suicide.
"Bu't one man didn’t refuse.
“He took the gun and saluted. 
‘O, mon Captainc,’ lie- said, and left 
my tent. I heard the shot almost 
immediately.”
Joined During War
Captain Hamilton enlisted in the 
French Foreign Legion as a pri­
vate during the World war. He 
was transferred to the flying corps, 
where he became an officer. After 
the war lie was allowed to attend 
the military school in France and 
began his service in Africa as a 
second lieutenant in 1920.

DIDJA NOTICE
Well, here we are, a couple more 
days and then a much longed for 
vacation. Yes, a vacation—it doesn’t 
matter whether it' is for a year or 
for only two days, it is a vacation, 
and that is something in the night 
-classes. In case you don’t suspect, 
I refer to the Easter Vacation, 
•'which is listed in the Official Cal­
endar on page ten of the. Night 
Student Carnegie Handbook. What 
am I going to do with this long 
vacation I’m afraid if I tell you, 
the secret would be out and then 
it would not be quite so interest­
ing. Go to California—Indiana, 
Washington—or some bther distant 
point during the vacation with the 
reduced rates offered- by the rail- 
.roads. Well, that would be some­
thing, but then, why travel so far 
when we have these places just 
around the corner? Why, Califor­
nia is only a. stone’s throw from 
the Campus and Indiana, not mucn 
farther, then with Washington a 
matter of a few miles, why, 1 
could cover all these places jn a 
gas buggy in one day. Believe it 
or hot—no—well, I was thinking 
;of our own State. Now, that’s a 
state to "be in.
*****
What state—state of. excitement, 
of course. Ever come out from a 
classroom in a state of excitement? 
Yes, I suppose we all do at some 
time or another during our stay on 
the campus. My state of excite­
ment comes when I don't fail on 
a test. Of course, that happens 
'once in a while, and when it docs, 
you can be sure that I don’t know 
whether I am coming or going. 
With my light load of assignments, 
¡and my aversion to study, it sure 
5s an exciting moment for me to 
' ¡find that I really know more than 
my instructor, which is to be ex­
pected when you consider that an 
idle • night student doesn’t have 
much time to study.
**'***
I mentioned the night handbook 
an this dis,course, and while bn the 
¿ul|\jcct I’ should like to call your 
attention to this little book. It 
sure is a fine little reminder of all 
things on and about the campus. 
|You don’t have a copy, well, that 
5s your fault as I recall reading, in 
'the Plaid that there are copies to 
be had for the asking. I believe 
the Cashier’s Office is the place 
to apply for the book. Now don’t 
all make a rush for this office; 
they might think it was a run on 
a bank or' something.
*****
Say, those Thistle picture taking 
evenings of the past two weeks 
were certainly interesting times. 
Saw many new faces come up only 
to go down to defeat before the 
camera. Sure does make one feel 
sort of flighty watching the birdie. 
I was afraid that the camera would 
not last long enough to get my 
picture, so made sure that I was in 
the first group taken, so when you 
see the pictures, you will know 
that I am in last rank of the first 
group, second from the middle 
right-hand corner, reading from 
north to south, and in case you 
don’t know, I don’t come from 
Red Onion or Cabbage Hill, for 
that matter.
*****
Referring to the handbook and 
the social calendar, I notice that 
a smoker is scheduled to be held 
, on April 2. Yes, but that is for 
the. Industries, those toilers on the 
campus, with the big-a-the-musc. 
Gee, I wish I was registered in 
that school. . They seem to have 
all the breaks. Their studies are 
not so hard, at least we are told 
so by some who think they know, 
and they always seem to be such a 
congenial lot of boys. It may be 
something in the atmosphere which 
makes them so friendly, but what­
ever it is, I wish there was some 
of it in , our building. We engineers 
you know, are so far ahead that 
'wif'don’t have time to be sociable 
or something like that. The funny 
part is, though, even with our su­
perior intellect, we do have to go 
to the industries for sonic of our 
classes, which to me, at least, 
should not be tolerated. At all 
events; I am going to try to crash 
the gate at the Industries smoker, 
just as I did the Arts Dance, even 
if I have to disguise myself as 
mere foundryman.
THAT the March lion seems to 
be losing his spirit.
THAT a lost pendant car ring 
almost caused an Arts-Industrics 
fued.
THAT Easter vacation starts 
this week and it will be as wel­
come as a wet Republican plank.
THAT the night art critic 
knows his brush strokes despite 
the fact that he found little 
wrong with the show.
THAT "Campus Abominations” 
made it’s appearance last week; 
we know some they forgot to 
mention.
THAT the Idle Night Students 
is concerned 'about the final 
exams; feature a guy with his 
brains and lack of ambition be­
ing bothered.
THAT the yellow horses arc 
losing some of their color; some­
thing better be -done about this 
for such a condition detracts 
greatly from the beauty of the 
campus.
THAT that’s that and I’ll be 
sccnya!

FOR THE LOWEST COST 
AND GREATEST EASE
Set your ‘‘date*’ for after 8:30 P.M. and take ad­
vantage of the low Night Rates. (A dollar call is 
60c at night; a 50c call is 35c.)
By making a date, the folks will be at home. Thus 
you can make a Station to Station call rather than 
a more expensive Person to Person call.
Just give the operator your home telephone num­
ber. If you like, charges can be reversed.

night classcs which were taken in the 
Union during the past two weeks.
The annual will go to press short­

“Elisabeth von Oesterreich,” 
Movie At Avenue Cinema
The Avenue Cinema, 809 Liberty avenue, will open next Monday, March 21, with the startling .feature, 
‘‘Elisabeth von Oestcrrich” (Eliza­beth, Empress of Austria), Lil Da- gover, the darling of the European scrtfen, creating the title role.
Heretofore always been cast as an adventuress, she impresses now in a sympathetic role, doing really 
splendid work.
The picture was re-enacted in the actual historic spots and is a true portrayal of Elizabeth's path through life, from tile time she was the cheerful and happy princess in the royal court in Munich until her assassination by the anarchist Luc- ch.eni in Geneva.
APRIL2-DATE SELECTED 
FORNIGHT COLLEGE 
OF INDUSTRIES SMOKER
Famous Kiltie Band Will Be 
on Hand to Entertain 
Industries Men
The Night College of Industries 
men will be entertained on April 2 
with a smoker. This is the sccond 
smoker of the year Which the In­
dustries College holds. As is usual, 
the large Men’s. Gymnasium has been 
reserved for the affair.
Tickets have been printed and are 
being distributed to the night indus­
tries’ men. These tickets _ together 
with' the registration card showing 
that the student is registered in the 
Night College of Industries will se­
cure' admittance to the smoker.
The officers of the Night College of 
Industries have always furnished tiie 
students registered in this college 
with the very best possible entcm'n- 
ment and the present staff is doing 
its part to make this smoker a suc­
cess also.
Several features in the way of en­
tertainment have been 'secured and 
will be presented in due time dt the 
smoker. Of great importance, hP'.v- 
cver, will be the presence of the 
Kiltie Band. No Industries smoker 
would be complete if the band were 
not there, so come prepared to en­
joy good music as only the band can 
play.
After a complete program starting 
at 8 p. m. and lasting about three 
hours, refreshments will be served 
to all those present. It is not neces­
sary to tell the old students about 
this smoker, they arc eagerly awaitnig 
the date, but for the new students, 
we -will offer just a word—come out 
on. April 2 and you will never miss 
another Industries Smoker as .long 
as. you are on the campus. Make sure 
to get your smoker ticket.
All night industries students who 
arc working 011 the Night Student 
Council Activities arc cxpcctcd to 
be at the men's gymnasium 011 Satur-1 
day afternoon, April 2, at 2 :C0 to 
make preparations for the evening.
*AVVENE UAl|—college play- 
even the best of it drags at 
times. Then’s when a telephone 
chat with Mother and Dad counts most. What 
a thrill to hear their'cheery voices—a thrill 
that lasts for days!
Make it a habit—telephone home each week. 
Give them a budget of campus doings—gather 
the tidbits of family news. You’ll enjoy it and 
they will, too. A “voice visit” home is next 
best to being there!
Expensive? Not a bit of it, and there’s nothing 
easier!

Dances, Inexpensive or Cheap?
The current announcement of a reduction in the price 
of the Senior Ball completes a move started at the first of 
the year to make Carnegie’s dances less expensive. Every 
major social, function of the present social calendar ha5 
shown some saving for th?. student in reduced admission 
prices. The committees are to be congratulated on taking 
steps to lighten the burden on the undergraduates in view 
of the depression. Whether or not the ecomonic distress is 
reflected in the college with the men having a reduced bud­
get for entertainment is difficult to determine. Yet it is 
true that positive steps in the direction taken are of definite 
value.The efficiency of the committees in keeping their dances 
from being cheapened in other than a monetary sense is 
even more noteworthy than their economies. Our neigh­
boring college gave a recent function which attracted three 
thousand people, many having no connection with the 
university at all. The adoption of big business tactics in 
order to give a party, traditionally intended only for the 
group with the common bond a true college gives, threatens 
the very reason for the existence of such dances. When a 
group cannot function as a separate and self-sulTicient 
unit it need no longer claim its independence. Carnegie will 
do well to keep from following its neighbor into competition 
with public amusements. 1 K.

The Interfraternity Sing
Introduced in a year already marked with a number of 
worth while innovations, the Interfraternity Sing Contest 
should prove an interest event. Any competition of such a 
constructive nature should easily find a place for itself and 
become identified as a tradtioh. YVe wish it complete suc­
cess on its initial trial.
Movies Depict An Obsolete College Student
A fellow student has aptly remarked, "First attend the 
Schenley Theater to see what a college student should be 
like, and then come over, to the Carnegie campus to sec 
what they really arc like. The contrast will be astounding.”
We are all too familiar with the non-representative Joe 
College and Betty Co-ed characters as shown on the films. 
True, they do exist 011 every campus, but they are as rare 
as freaks. Psychology will uphold—and so will a modicum 
of common sense—that it is absurd to select an individual, 
place a tilted dink on his head, render a sleepy look to his 
eyes, engulf him in a pair of those sailor-you’re-my-hero 
baggy trousers, and then appellate him as a “typical college 
man.”
Movie producers have been too prone to depict the ac­
tions of several eccentric individuals as representative of 
thousands. If these movie producers were on the Carnegie 
campus they would probably, enfold entire plots around such 
individualistic incidents' as a handful of dramats roller-skat­
ing about tlVe campus at three o’clock in the morning, a few 
co-eds wearing brilliantly red skirts, or some fraternity initia­
tion event just as odd.
Movie magnates cannot, and probably wish not, to 
Visualize the uncountable' hours spent by a truly typical 
student over books, typewriters, and slide-rules, or in the 
¦ laboratories, studios, or kitchenettes. They find it futile to 
attempt to portray on the screen the significant fact that 
college students earn thirty million dollars a year. Instead 
they too frequently pay homage to a slouchv, lethargic, dull 
creature who is exactly diametric to the ambitious, diligent, 
and alert student of reality.
But far be it from us to reprove and chide the movie 
directors who give life to such a character. Rather, we 
sympathize with them. To select a representative specimen 
from such a complex array of human beings as roam about 
most college campuses is undoubtedly a hapless endeavor. 
In short, we will agree that the average college student is a 
psychological knot. G.

“The Condoliers”
We wish to call the attention of the student body to 
the very fine production of that: famous Gilbert and Sullivan 
operetta, “T11E GONDOLIERS,” which will be presented 
by the Departments of Music and Drama at Carnegie Music 
Hall on the evenings of April 6- and 7.
The proceeds of these performances will be used to 
establish a Student Aid Fund in the departments of music 
and drama. Such a fund is an imperative need at the pres­
ent time, if deserving students of- talent are to be enabled 
to continue their college courses.
The revival of this operetta will serve, it is hoped, a two­
fold purpose: enlist the interest of those who regard the 
needy student of promise as worthy of help, and discover 
to lovers of Gilbert and Sullivan the reasons for the great 
popularity of “THE.'GONDOLIERS” in England. The 
enthusiasm which the production of “THE MIKADO” by 
these departments aroused last year gives assurance that a 
similar response will attend Gilbert’s lyric sparkle against 
a Venetian background and Sullivan’s- engaging music amid 
the gondoliers on the Grand Canal. H.
FROM THE FENCE
Real Fightin’—
Last Friday eve the Eastern Intcrcollcgiatc Box­ing Confcrcncc held its first annual slaughter at the Carnegie Gym. If such fights continue stronger planks will have to be put in the platform, to pre­vent the contestants from being bounced through. . . . The Buckncll coach showed fine sportsmanship by taking on one of his own men in an exhibition match. The attitude of the fighters however was too apologetic to be really interesting. ... A cou­ple of the West Virginia boys jput on an ex­hibition match that was really a fight and they found time to amuse the cus­tomers, too. . . . A petition is be- i 11 g circulatcd among the fans for bigger and stronger referees. A referee is At least expected to be able to break a clinch even if he isn’t particularly interested in the fight. . . . Really, Buddy Ovcrcnd is a mightyfine fellow even if he is outgrowing his tux. . . .The lady in the seventh row, right, ought to learn the location of the "button" before attending an­other fight with a man versed in the sport. . . .

More of the Prom—
Dean Green encountered a Gamma Phi neophyte, from Duqucsnc, running amuck in the halls near the Urban Room. The lad clad only in kimono was after Kay Kaiser’s autograph. . . . The Pitt Engineers were holding a dance in the main ball­room. . . . There weren’t enough Sigma Nus pres­ent to make it worth while playing the White Star song more than once. . . . "Quecne” Sclsam, now a big shot for Thcta Xi, was having a big evening. . . . Koultcr Ziegler looked a little tired 
from helping Kay teach school all day. . . . Ask Kay what she learned at »Teknon last week. . . . Jim Rogan turned occulist later in the evening.... Ed Keller turned poet. Witness this outburst:To Agnes Cancell-icrc,From her faithful finan-cicre,He could have brought her some biere But lie that he’d rather siere Wearing these hiere
FLOWERS.

The Week’s Headliner—
With the very swank and exclusive Women’s Prom Ruth Nyc and her committee gave the men a real treat. With Kay Kaiser’s band in the exotic Urban Room the eveping was quite a pleasure despite the large crowd. The several hours that were spent at a midnight dinner l^st year were kept for dancing this time. This arrangement was quite satisfactory to all except those who paid the $14 assessment last year. McNary-Traa led the Grande Marche which wound all over the floor and finally disbanded after everyone had become .dizzy. The men had a rare privilege, that of keep­ing a favor. Very nice leather calling card cases. The advance list of guests last week gave rise to shouts frqm those who were overlooked. Those who made the biggest noise include Will Spangler,
Jim Rogan, Jim Williams, Miles Kinley, Freddie Hoyt, Ray Knopf, Prexy Brennan, Jim Stahl (much noise), Fred Flaherty, Lin Holvcic, and one hundred fifty-two others.* * * *
Still More—
As per special instructions to the elevator boys the elevator service was non-stop from first to seventeenth floors for guests at the dance. . . . The Carnegie banner, located among the orchestra, was both off center and rather misplaced. . . . Ruth Noyc had an overall-back gown. . . . Dr. Watkihs. trottcd around with a program in his hand. . . . Prof Swanson was caught with a far-away look several times. . . . Dean Green was looking for fires with the viligancc of a forest ranger. . . . Three Geneva College boys rated the dance. . . . A number of prominent Tech males did not rate the dance. . . . Considerable of the very fine punch was spilled 011 evening .gowns. . . . During the March the chaperons filled up on punch. . . .
* * * *
Fair Exchange—
In exchange for a crack about some borrowed towels Supcrschnozzle Jalonack and Will Sketres gave Doc Marks the razz because he had to shift his car into low to make a little grade. . . . Scobell Hall finally won a basketball game (by forfeit).. . . The Engineering Freshmen have been towed thru the labs with jaws agape learning all about engineering.' "Let’s see you make it go, mister.”. . . James Montgomery Flagg said after judging a co-ed beauty contest at Syracuse University that he wondered how all the beautiful girls got in New York and all the ugly ones in co-ed beauty contests. . . . Why is it that Dramats and Costume Ecs get their pictures regularly in the daily sheets and no one- else can rate? .... William J. Burns recently had a fight with his girl, "Midge,” over religion. . . . We thot Spring was here, tra la, but 
now look what we have again. Oh, well, nothing like a nice sunny Xmas and a white Easter. . . . * * * *
With the Men—
The Four Horsemen.of the Dorms, Mathus, Lin­coln, Miller, and Aimonc, attended a rather warm West Penn Nurses’ Dance. Gee, that Aimonc boy's hair! . . . Our Red Fergus is in great demand among girls, who have cars. One nice day Red was giving a car full of ferns a break when a phaeton with more fems stopped across the street. After waiting

Pi Alpha Delta, the honorary 
fraternity of the Department of 
Printing, issued a call for new 
members last Wednesday. The men 
to whom the honor was given arc 
Joseph Cangiolosi ftnd Frances 
Dill, seniors; R. Murray. Kline, 
Harold Pressman and Ned Stirling, 
juniors, and Shorey Allen, a soph­
omore.
Mr. Cangiolosi is a member of 
the Pi Kappa Alpha social frater­
nity, apd Mr. Pressman of Beta 
Sigma Rho. Mr. Allen is a mem­
ber of the Delta Tau Delta social 
fraternity and was the highest rank­
ing sophomore in the Department 
of Printing at the end of last 
semester.
The members of Pi Alpha Delta 
arc chosen on the basis of schol­
arship, personality, moral character, 
and interest in activities. They arc 
selected from one of the three 
sophomores having the highest 
scholastic ranking and from juniors 
and seniors of high ranking. The 
membership must not exceed twen­
ty per cent of the number of -stu­
dent enrolled in the three upper

Mr. Joseph S. Lambie, operating 
manager of the Concrete Products 
Company of America, will address 
the weekly meeting of the Carnegie 
student chapter of the American 
Society of Civil Engineers tomor­
row at 11:30 in Room 60, Engi­
neering Hall. Mr. Lambie’s sub­
ject will be ‘‘Sewer and Culvert 
Pipe Design,” and he will pay 
special attention to the portion of 
this topic which deals with rein­
forced concrete culverts and pipes. 
He has been considered an authori­
ty 011 this subject for many years.
Because of a very crowded lec­
ture schedule for this semester, 
there will be two meetings of the 
society this-week. Today at 11:30 
in Room '60, Engineering Hall, 
Steven Malevich, a senior in the 
Department of Civil Engineering, 
will address the chapter; his sub­
ject is "The Florionopolis Bridge.-"

The Single Standard In Grading 
Systems
The grading system, as it is 
used at Carnegie Tech, or for that 
matter of fact, ¡11. any American 
institution of higher learning, has, 
from the point of view of the stu­
dent, very marked disadvantages.
I shall limit myself to the dis­
cussion of one certain defect of 
the system, that is a defect when 
viewed by the high grade student. 
It is well known that some de­
partments give out a much stlifer 
brand of grades than some others. 
As a result, a man who gets a 
5.00 average in one department 
may be doing better work than a 
student in another department who, 
however,• receives a 5.40 average. 
The importance, of the matter will 
be fully understood, if one stops 
to remember that scholarships as 
well as fellowships are awarded 011 
a liasis of comparative grades. A 
student in such a department works 
under a marked handicap and 
therefore docs not have the, same 
chances for a scholarship.
One has to admit of course that 
it is impossible to have mathe­
matically exact grades, a grade be­
ing more or less an intangible 
estimation of student work and 
knowledge. But it should be pos­
sible. to grade all students along a 
single standard, or rather by a 
single general system, such that 110 
student in any department will 
have reason to wonder why he 
gets a lower grade than he thinks 
lie deserves compared to some 
other department.
There seem to be two basic 
methods of grading. One is what 
could be termed as the "exact 
method”, where a student gets the 
exact grade his work seems to 
command, 110 matter what the gen­
eral average of the class. The 
other is the “comparative method”, 
where the highest portion of the 
class is awarded A’s and B’s, the 
middle portion C’s and D’s and so 
on. I shall not go into tho rela­
tive merits of either one of these 
two systems, but it is logical to 
demand that one of these two, and 
only that one, be used throughout 
¿11 the departments.

A STEP FORWARD
The ambitious student, look­ing ahead to a successful 
career in business or profes­sion, will find that a connec­
tion with a reputable bank­ing institution is a real step forward. Plan to make such a connection while you arc in college —the Mellon Na­tional Bank welcomes ac­counts of any size and our officers arc always ready to 
interest themselves in your problems.
LITTLE THEATER REVIEW
There is yet time to see the 
Little Theater production of An­
ton Tchckov’s “The Sea Gull." The 
cast of the opening performance had 
to overcome many handicaps: an au­
ditorium overheated 'o the point of 
junglc-hcat, the resultant restivencss 
of the audience, their own inexperi­
ence—for this is the first freshman- 
show—and finally, the difficulty im­
posed by the subtle texture of the 
play itself. In this drama is a 
strange potpourri of symbolism and: 
introspectioh, a maze of tangled loves 
and frustrations. Irina Arkadin, a 
famous actress, adores Trigorin, a 
successful novelist who finds in Nina 
Zarctclmy, a young girl, the delicately 
feverish tenderness of youthful love, 
an emotional experience lie knows 
himself to have missed. Nina, enam­
ored of her own desire to become as 
great as Madame Arkadin, is drawn 
to him, fascinated by his glamor. 
Nina is beloved by Irina's son, Kostya 
Trcplcv, who is torn by repressed, 
passion and lacerated by her growing 
coolncss. He, in turn, is the object 
of the hopeless love of Masha, the 
daughter of his mother’s steward, 
Shamracv, and.. Polina. Polina’s sym­
pathetic understanding of her daugh­
ter lies deep, for she, too, is the 
victim of an unreciprocated feeling 
for Dorn, a doctor who looks after 
old Sorin, Irina’s brother. Dorn,
ironic philosopher, is a man whose 
life has already been fulfilled, and 
certainly has no place for the dis­
gruntled Polina. Out of this emo­
tional chaos the players must contrive 
some unity, even though it be unity 
of atmosphere, and this is a task 
which has sent down to defeat many 
a professional cast, and an even 
greater number of professional au­
diences.
The characteriaztion of Nina, played 
by Fern Ball, was outstanding; in­
experience left no blemishes on her 
work. She glowed with the flame of 
expectancy and ambition, with the 
look, to borrow Trigorin's phrase, 
"of a passionate gambler who has 110 
money.” Later, she seeks, having 
suffered disillusionment, to find com­
pensation, or at least forgetfulness, 
in her work; then it was that Nina’s 
words were a part of life, existing 
as something more than "lines”. 
Polly Rowlcs, except for • an occa­
sional rush of words, .held the audi­
ence with an excitable and colorful 
Irina. At times her increase in 
tempo and a too-grcat range of in­
flection were lost. Kostya Treplcv 
(Edward Harmlc) sought the will- 
o-the-wisp goal of powerful but re.- 
straincd emotion with uneven success. 
When he was good—as in the fourth 
act—lie was vcr3r, ver}r good, but 
when he was not, you couldn’t hear 
him. His quietness was at times 
unconvincing, at times moving. An 
interesting contrast arose from Bart­
lett Robinson’s portrayal of Trigorin 
and William Roos’ characterizing of 
Dorn. These men were alike in ex­
ternals, , but though the novelist is 
still at odds with life, the doctor 
stands aloof and somehow superior 
to it. Both these players achieved 
maturity, Robinson‘choosing the road 
of deliberate restraint and Roos the 
path of simple naturalness. Maraine 
Haythorne, as Polina, fretted and 
nagged wearily, and Audrey Kelley, 
,as Masha; except for momentary 
lapses, gave the role beauty and the 
peculiar acridness of an unfulfilled 
life, an impression like the scent of 
autumn flowers. As Mcdvedonka, 
Masha’s husband, Barry Mulligan 
drew his schoolmaster as an inanely 
prosaic fool. Shamraev, an extreme 
bore, Sorin’s steward, we thought 
slightly overplayed, though it may be 
Donald Gallagher, who played him, 
is of our mind, that an extreme bore 
can never be overdrawn. As the 
somewhat decrepit Sorin, who never 
got what he wanted, Roy Minet was 
a pleasant old man, though his in­
terpretation of age was more effec­
tive than his makeup, particularly 
that disconcerting beard.
We could have run on into the 
great battle of critics as. to whether 
“The Sea Gull” is essentially a literary 
or a dramatic creation. Let it be 
enough, however, to say that 
Tcheckov’s art still exerts a kind of 
musty power over an audience.

to present the matter with which 
they will work in such a fashion 
that even the most non-technical 
minded visitors will be able to un­
derstand the -workings of whaL 
they will see. One method by 
which the committee intends to ac­
complish this objective is through 
the use of appropriate placards, in­
forming the reader not merely of 
the name of the exhibited device, 
but of its practical use and appli­
cation. Other plans have not been 
developed to a degree where they 
arc ready for publication. These 
consist of suggestions submitted by 
every member of Pi Tau Sigma at 
the regular meeting last Wednes­
day.An error appearing in the last 
issue of the Tartan as to the com­
mittee. in charge should be correct­
ed. The committee consists of 
Frederic W. Latham, chairman and 
mechanical option representative; 
Regis C. Binder, aeronautical op­
tion representative, and Joseph R. 
Vcnsel, junior representative.
In a short time all official, no­
tices of Pi Tau Sigma will be post­
ed in a key case, similar to that 
of Eta Kappa Nu, which will be 
placed on the first floor of Engi­
neering Hall.
Sigma Alpha Iota
Sigma Alpha Iota, women’s mu­

Dowell tea Wednesday afternoon, 
March 30, in the Exhibition Hall 
of the College of Fine Arts. Miss 
Nicholson, a graduate of Tech and 
a member of Sigma Alpha Iota is 
in charge of the tea. Students who 
desire tickets should communicate 
with Martha Burrcy, ‘president of 
the honorary. The proceeds frqm 
the afternoon will go toward spon­
soring a camp in Vermont.
Tau Beta Pi
At a recent meeting of Tau Beta 
Pi, national engineering honorary, 
Professor F. M. McCullough, head 
of the Civil Engineering Depart­
ment and a member- of the Ad­
visory Board of Tau Beta Pi, ex­
tended the group an invitation to 
attend a dinner Thursday after­
noon, April 14. This dinner will 
be sponsored by faculty members 
who were present at the Faculty 
Forum Dinner given recently by 
Tau Beta Pi. %
At the meeting there was a dis­
cussion concerning the interviewing 
of men for the honorary fraternity. 
Two men, J. Halpern and L. E. 
Robinson, were appointed to secure 
the averages of all Juniors in the 
College of Engineering' who are in 
the upper eighth of their class.
At the next meeting the eligible 
names will be selected and can­
didates will be interviewed Sunday 
afternoon, April 3.
The next two meetings of the 
honorary will be* held in the Facul­
ty Club room on March 30 and 
April 3.
