MR. ADVERTISER
Do you really know the advertising 
value of a school paper? Do you 
realize that Carnegie Tech is the larg­
est technical school in the United 
States—not going to be any more, but 
IS? Do you realize that 2500 students 
are enrolled here—enough to make a 
good sized town with no children or 
old people? Do you know that The 
Tartan is its only student paper and 
appears 36 times during the school 
year? Now, Mr. Advertiser, don’t you 
think it would pay to let these young 
money spenders (three-fourths are 
men) know what you have to sell? For

PITTSBURGH, PA., WED NBSDAY, MARCH 2, 1910No. 21
AERO CLUB.
Professor George H. Follows gave a most interest­
ing address last Wednesday afternoon before the 
Aero Club on “Air Navigation.” Following is a digest 
of the account:
Beginning with what is said to be the first balloon 
ascension in the year 1306 which was witnessed by 
the Emperor of China, Fo-Kien, he took up the var­
ious stages of development referirng to Leonardo de 
Vinci’s idea as sketched about the year 1500, and to 
Fauste Veranzeo, who made the first parachute de­
sent in 1617 from the top of a Venician tower. He 
then described how in the year 1648, the Bishop of 
Chester had made the first flying machine, but that 
this had failed to fly.
The next step was late in the 17th century when 
Ciano de Bergerac, having noticed how inflated pa­
per bags would fill out and expand when heated, at­
tempted to raise himself from the earth by fastening- 
many bags of air about him and standing in the warm 
sun. He had called the people about him to see him 
soar in the air and they were furnished with much 
amusement when he failed to rise. Then the Mont­
golfier brothers, French paper makers, in 1771 made 
the first aerostat, or balloon. They also made a 
parachute in which the elder brother Joseph made 
successful descents from a house-top. Their first 
hot-air balloon, made of paper, caught fire before it 
had a chance to rise. They then made a larger one,
112 feet in diameter, and this rosé 1000 feet, much 
to the astonishment of the people.
The next step in ballooning was in 1783 when 
hydrogen gas was first used intsead of hot-air. A 13- 
foot bag was constructed and filled with hydrogen, 
which was then called the new kind of air, and when 
it was released it passed clear out of sight through 
the clouds. It stayed up until it exploded and when 
it came down some distance away, where the people 
did not know of its ascent, they thought it was the
devil coming down out of the sky and set upon it 
with rakes and hoes to effect its demolution. Then 
came the first toy flying-machine, an ingenious con­
trivance of bow and string, which was made by 
Launoy & Bienvenie.
Now came a gap of over sixty years in which little 
or nothing was done in the deveilopment of air craft. 
In 1847 a most important step was taken in the con­
struction of a dirigible balloon by Partridge who built 
one on very much the same principle as the Zeppelin 
airship of today. It carried large heavily-built en­
gines and boilers, fuel and water and a set of pro­
pellers and steering sails. Partridge invented the 
compensating air bag or balloonet. A little later an 
engineer named Moeesworth built a dirigible very 
much on the same lines but instead of inflating the 
large bag, he filled this with small spherical balloons. 
Then for a few years invention centered upon per­
fecting dirigibles. L. E. Rose built and operated a 
balloon consisting of two cigar shaped bags and 5 
propellers, three for lifting and two for moving for­
ward.
Then came Gifford with his first dirigible in 1852. 
He put on a 3 H. P. engine; this together with the 
boilers weighed 350 pounds. The toital weight car­
ried was over 3,000 pounds. He made a short suc­
cessful flight of a few seconds. Prof. Follows here 
explained that a short successful flight in those days 
meant a good deal, even though it was for a few 
seconds, as they were getting at the principles upon 
which future success was to depend. In 1855 Gifford 
made a second dirigible but this also failed.
In 1862 an inventor named Phillips made some very 
interesting experiments with a machine carrying a 
vertical frame of adjustable slats, like an enormous 
Venetian blind. When driving along the road the 
aggregation of small individual planes was found to 
have a decided lifting capacity. This was an im­

---------------------------------------------------

portant step in the evolution of the flying machine. 
In 1870 Penaud’s flying toy aeroplanes caused much 
wonderment and thought. In 1872 a novel form of 
balloon and parachute combined was introduced by 
Dupoy de Lowe; it was a kind of Umbrella Top 
Dirigible Parachute Balloon, and was built on the 
plan of a huge umbrella with a balloon inside.
In 1881 Tessandier in France made a dirigible 
balloon and experimented with various gasses. Cap­
tain Renard in 1884 made the first really successful 
flight in a dirigible, describing the figure 8 in the air 
and showing a fair degree of control. His second 
model was 155 feet long. He used an 8y2 H. P. steam 
engine and made severe1 successful flights, one of 
which was for a distance of 5 miles in 23 minutes.
Sir Hiram Maxim in 1888 determined to solve the 
problem once for all, and succeeded in getting a sub­
scription of $100,000. The difficulty was to get a 
light engine. He made a great many tests and finally 
developed the curvature of the modern planes. The 
weight of his machine was 3% tons, having 4,000 
square feet of carrying surface and a propeller 18 
feet in diameter. He met with some accidents and 
in the face of public ridicule with all his money spent, 
gave it up, but Sir Hiram was closer to the flying 
problem than any man up to that time. The mis­
take he made was that of experimenting with a finish­
ed machine instead of a model.
The next man who set out to solve the problem of 
aviation in this country was Prof. Langley. He de­
cided to try out various models and arranged to try 
them out over the Potomac River from the top of a 
house-boat. His first models look very much like 
some of the monoplanes we have today. He was en­
abled by the use of these models to determine a good 
arrangement of planes, etc. In 1896 he built a larger 
model, fitting it was a 1 H. P. motor and this machine 
made three successful automatic flights across the 
Potomac. He then applied to Congress for an appro­
priation to continue his experiments and was allowed 
$50,000 by them. He built a 50 H. P. machine which 
at the first trial fell into the Potomac and was 
abandoned.
Experiments up to this time had proven that what 
was wanted was not a machine that could fly but a 
man who could fly, and that man was found in Lilien- 
thal, a German, who as a boy had experimented with 
gliders which he had made to be attached to the arms 
and operated as bird’s wings are when soaring. By 
starting at the top of a hill and taking a long run 
he had been able to make successful short flights. A 
most unfortunate accident ended his life in 1896 just 
when the principle of aviation was again about to be 
discovered. Close upon the death of Lilienthal, fol­
lowed the death of Pilcher in England in one of 
Lilienthal’s gliders. Then Wolfert in Germany was 
killed by the bursting of the gas bag of his dirigible. 
In 1897 Schwartz made a balloon of aluminum sheets 
but it was not a success. At the first flight the belt 
came off the propeller pulley, the machine came down 
and the wind taking possession of it destroyed the 
entire affair.
In 1900 the Wright brothers in American began 
their experimenting. They first learned to fly in 
gliders and then perfected an aeroplane. These men 
are both mechanics and have used their own money 
in their experiments, and best of all they knew how 
to experiment. They asked themselves three ques­
tions and then set out to answer them. These ques­
tions were: “Should the operaor lie prone, sit up 
or hang down?” “Are steering devices better than 
sliding weights?” “Is it possible to use a rudder in 
front?” When they had completed their experiments 
they had answered all three of these important ques­
tions to the satisfaction of themselves and the world. 
On December 17th they made their first flight under 
power, and when the Government offered a prize for 
the man that could take up a heavier-than-air ma­
chine and stay up for more than one hour and attain 
a speed of 36 miles an hour. The Wright brothers, 
took their machine to Fort Meyer and you all know 
how successful they were. They exceeded the limits 
set in both directions.
Previous to this, in 1901, Santos Dumont in France 
had created a sensation by navigating around the 
Eiffel Tower and back to the starting point. He was 
the first man to ever start for a definite point in a 
dirigible and come back to the starting point.
In 1910 the Wright brohers made the remarkable 
time of 24 miles in 38 minutes. Since then, progress 
has been very rapid. In place of the very few men 
who were able to operate a flying-machine in 1909, 
there are now in France alone over 300 recognized 
aviators. The progress made in the dirigible balloon 
has kept pace with that of the aeroplane, so that now 
Zeppelin in Germany has a rigid dirigible, composed 
of separate gas compartments which is capable of 
carrying 50 passengers, and sufficient fuel and other 
supplies to last for a trip of one month in the air.
When the Wright brothers made their famous 
demonstrations before the government officials at 
Fort Meyer in 1908, it was conceded that the problem 
of aviation had been solved, and the world took off 
its hat to the United States.
Professor Follows concluded his entertaining dis­
cussion by prophecying that during the next five 
years the development in aeronautics would be phe- 
nominal, and he hoped'and believed we should live 
to see aircraft as plentiful as automobiles and travel 
in them as safely.

WHIT€ FRIARS.
Walter B. Edmundson, coach for the White Friars, 
having recovered from his attack of the grippe, will 
be present at the trial for the chorus to be held on 
Wednesday evening, March 2, at 7.30, in the Assem­
bly Hall of the A. & J. Building. The candidateis 
for the cast are requested to watch the bulletin 
boards for announcement when the final notice will 
be made. The chorus will be picked this week. 
Prospects are for the best chorus had by the Friars 
since its organization, as Coach Edumundson has 
been picking up all the newest steps and dances 
used in the latest New York productions.
Among other spectacular electrical effects will be 
a large winking moon, which will be used in connec­
tion with a new moon dance. A wheelbarrow dance 
has been devised for the first chorus, that is bound 
to make a hit.
The management has announced the signing of the 
contract to appear at Youngstown, Ohio, with the 
entire company.
The New Lampoon Building—An Unique Structure.
The last number of "The Harvard Lampoon" 
was gotten out in special style to commemorate the 
occupancy, by that paper, of a building devoted 
entirely to their own uses. The “Lampoon” is in 
its 58th volume.
The following description of the building is 
taken from “The Harvard Bulletin” of Feb. 9:
The building is now complete. It was designed 
by Edmund M. Wheelwright, ’76, one of the founders 
of the Lampoon, and now a leading architect in 
Boston. Mr. Wheelwright has devoted a great deal 
•of time and attention to the building. He made a 
trip to Europe to get for it materials which he could 
not purchase in this country, and for the last two
months has given nearly all his time to seeing that 
the builders have built as he planned. Furniture 
has been picked up in Holland, leaded glass win­
dows have been found in Belgium, and the building 
contains the finest collections of Delf tiles in this 
country.
The new home of the Lampoon is in the heart 
of that territory called the “Gold Coast,” and occu­
pies all of the small square bounded by Mt. Auburn, 
Bow and Plympton Streets and opposite Randolph 
hall. The Lampoon building is made of Harvard 
brick and has many mullioned windows and a tile 
roof. The outline of the roof is broken by two low 
towers and eight dormer windows set in quaint Ger­
man gables. Nearly all of the windows are of lead­
ed glass and most of them have unique designs done 
in stained glass figures, which date back to the 17th 
century and were brought from Holland. The unu­
sual effect harmonizes perfectly with the surround­
ings.
The main entrance to the building is on Bow 
Street, just opposite Randolph. The vestibule and 
the lower hall are Doth done in 17tih century Dutch 
tiles, and on the wall facing the door is a fanciful 
design, done in tiles of blue and white. All the 
other tiles here are brown and white. On this floor 
are several small rooms. One is for receiving can­
didates for the various editorial positions and is 
called tihe Public Room.
Three rooms are for the business department of 
the paper and in the largest of these the tiles are 
arranged to represent a Chinese rug. The-sanetum, 
which is just beyond the business offices, is richly 
furnished and has heavy crossbeams of oak in the 
ceiling, and three of the walls contain a collection 
of old tiles. The only other room on this floor is 
the president’s office, which has a large open fire­
place. By means of a richly carved staircase the 
main room—'the banquet hall—is reached. This is 
truly a beautiful bit of architecture.
Here is the club room of the editors. The ceil­
ing goes clear to the roof, which is supported by 
heavy crossbeams of dark oak. The room is about 
forty feet long and extends the width of the house. 
Owing to the treatment of the ceiling the hall looks 
very much larger. The feature of the room is a 
handsome Elizabethan mantel and fireplace, which 
is over three centuries old. Mr. Wheelwright pur­
chased this rare antique in England while he was 
on his special trip abroad last summer looking for 
furnishings for the building.
The mantel itself is of ornately carved oak and 
is nine feet high and eight feet wide. In the centre 
are some of the finest old Dutch tiles in the building. 
The date of the construction of the fireplace, 1571, 
can plainly be seen. But it is not the only thing 
worthy of mention in the room. The walls are 
broken by eight beautiful mullioned windows and 
are hung with some fine old tapestries. These are 
the gift of Ralph W. Curtis ’76, one of the founders 
of the paper. Also on the lower part of the walls 
are some more Delf tiles. These tiles are brown and

---------------------------------------------------

white, and blue and white, and they made a fine pic­
ture puzzle for the workmen. The floor, which is 
the gift of Henry C. Mercer ’79, is also made of tiles. 
These are laid out in various geometrical designs. 
Thus, the chief characteristic of the building is the 
collection of Delf tiles. It can also be stated on very 
good authority that it is the finest collection in the 
country.
While abroad last summer, Mr. Wheelwright 
purchased also some old carved Flemish furniture 
for this room—heavy oak chairs, which took many 
months to carve, and tables which are works of art 
in themselves. This furniture includes a rare old 
Dutch sideboard. In this room will also be placed 
an article of little commercial value, but sacred to 
all Lampoon editors. It is an old oak table, on 
which are the initials of nearly all the members of 
the editorial boards past and present.
The room is lighted by three large brass Flem­
ish chandeliers which are hung from the ceiling and 
each contains a small forest of candles, Flemish 
candlesticks also have been placed about the walls. 
The room is quite unusual for a college publication 
and tar excels the quarters of any of the other Har­
vard papers, although the Crimson has a fine sanc­
tum. ;
Leading off the main room and situated in the 
tower at the western end of the Lampoon building 
is a small room known as the Ibis’s nest. The Ibis 
is the emblem of the Lampoon and in fact one of 
its officers is called by that name. This sanctum 
sanctorum has a domed roof and its walls are flanked 
with book-cases. In the centre of the room is a 
large brass Ibis holding in its beak a horn Tantern. 
Leading from this room is a small balcony overlook­
ing the banquet hall.
THE
CRUCIBLE CLUB.
On Wednesday evening, February 23rd, the Cruci­
ble Club met in Room 113. Dr. J. K. Clements, of 
the Government Testing Station, gave a very com­
prehensive and interesting lecture on “High Tem­
perature Measurements.” Opening with a sketch 
of the development of temperature measuring de­
vices, he clearly pointed out the essentials of an ac­
curate expansion medium and showed how the gas 
thermometer best serves as a standard of tempera­
ture measurement. As instruments for the determ­
ination of high temperatures, thermo-couples, re­
sistance thermometers, optical and radiation pyrom­
eters were discussed. Each type was clearly ex­
plained by sketches, and the principal characteris­
tics were shown. Following the description of the 
instruments considerable time was spent in ex­
plaining the applications of pyrometry. The im­
portance of a knowledge© f the temperatures exist­
ing during various metallurgical and chemical pro­
cesses wes especially emphasized. As an illustra­
tion the gas producer was considered. By aid of 
several charts the speaker pointed out the variations 
of composition of the gas with variations of temper­
ature within the producer, and showed that an ac­
curate regulation of the temperature is necessary 
for economic efficiency. At the close of the lecture 
a general discussion took place and Dr. Clements 
ably answered many inquiries relative to the topic 
under consideration.
The next meeting of the club will be held on 
March 16th. Details will appear later. Keep the 
date in mind.
TARTAN 7
PITTSBURGH ESPERANTO SOCIETY.
Pittsburgh, Pa., Feb. 25th, 1910. 
The Tartan, Carnegie Technical School, Pitsburgh, 
Pa.
Gentlemen:—>
I wish to thank you very much for the ten copies 
of tne February 16th Tartan, containing Dr. Schap- 
per’s article on Esperanto. Dr. Schapper has just 
informed me that about 150 applicants have made 
application to enter evening classes and also a num­
ber have also applied for the day classes. I wish to 
congratulate you on this splendid work and to say 
that I will take great pleasure in distributing the 
copies of the Tartan amongst educators in this city 
in order to show what is being done at the Carnegie 
Tech School.
Yours very truly,
HENRY FISHER, President.
THE COLLEGE PAPER.
The Chicago “Tribune” recently devoted an en­
tire page to the consideration of college newspapers 
—their work, purpose and effect. It said “the col­
lege world today produces the' most thoroughly read 
newspapers in the United States. These are the 
dailies published in the larger universities. From 
the first headline to the last advertisement they are 
read, re-read, and read again by students, faculty 
members, and town folk in their various communi­
ties. A mirror of life by day, in the institution in 
which it is issued, a connecting link between faculty 
and students, a buffer absorbing the shocks of con­
tending factions and opposing views, a megaphone 
crying aloud campus arms and voicing college spirit, 
and a moral force molding opinion—the college daily 
is all of these. It is a newspaper begotten in an 
idealism as absorbing as youth’s hopes, and it serves 
an ideal world apart from the larger field of man’s 
struggles.”
The “Argus” is not a daily, nor is it published 
in one of the “larger universities,” yet we believe its 
function is not far different from that of a Univer­
sity Daily. It should be a mirror of college life, it 
should represent both students and faculty, it should 
be democratic in its aims and purposes.—Illinois 
Wesleyan Argus, February 9th.

Until further notice, all copy for the “Tartan” must

left in the letter cabinet in the lower corridor of the 
A. & J. Building.
“THE THISTLE.”
The fifth annual edition of Carnegie Tech’s year 
book, “The Thistle,” is now in the process of prepar­
ation, which fact makes the present time an admir­
able one for a few words to the student body regard­
ing their share of the work.. The Beard can be very 
much hampered in their work by the tardiness or 
neglect of the student body to turn in material and 
drawings. Class Presidents and officers of clubs and 
societies desiring representation should present their 
case in writing to the editor-in-chief accompanied by 
a request for the space desired, and in what way 
that space is to be utilized.. Within the next week 
the committee for making the apportionment of 
space will be at work on the task. Since the book 
must be much smaller in size and the total number 
of pages, less the problem of allotting these will be 
more difficult.
The student body at large are appealed to for 
drawings, cartoons, grinds, sayings of faculty and
students, and anything even though it be a sugges­
tion or an idea that can be if use in the book. The 
Sophomores and Plebes should bear in mind that 
they are the ones who will get out next year’s book, 
and it will largely depend on the showing they make 
and the interest they display in this year’s book, 
whether they obtain a place on the coming board or 
not.
WE WANT FOOT BALL.
Foot Ball or no Foot Ball?
That is the question which must be decided in a 
very short time and the decision is one which rests 
wholely upon you students. If you care enough 
about foot ball to subscribe the amount of money 
asked for by the Athletic authorities then and then 
only, will we have foot ball. If you do not care 
enough for the game, for all it means to Tech, to 
give the very nominal sum asked of you, the will is 
yours and foot ball will be a thing of the past, for the 
coming season at least.
Back of the question of our having a foot ball team 
there lies a far more important one, the question of 
whether we have a spirit or not. Are we, to fall back 
on an analogy, like an over-grown hog, willing but 
not able to direct his movements so as to obtain what 
he wants, having to be lead always onward and up­
ward? Does our student body lack the will power to 
know definitely what it wants and the energy and de­
termination to go out and get it?
The decision to be made in regards to foot ball 
will, to a large extent, furnish the true answer to 
these questions.
If you should go around and ask among the stu­
dents any or all of the above questions you would 
have the proverbial answer thrown in your face: 
“Conditions are different here at Tech than they are 
at any other college.”. This answer has done its duty 
nobly since the founding of the school.. From all 
sides have we heard it. At all times we have heard 
it. We know full well how true it is and realize just 
what it means. We have backed up against those 
“different conditions” since our arrival on the scene 
and yet they do not cause us to feel so hopeless. In 
fact we are a little proud of the difference.. But does 
this difference mean that we can’t have a strong col­
lege spirit, one that would make a matter like the 
raising of enough money to continue foot ball seem 
trivial? We fail to see why it should. We know 
that in the few years that we have been doing busi­
ness we have been very proud of what we termed 
“Tech spirit.” On the foot ball field last year it was 
commented upon in the daily papers and favorably 
compared with that of institutions far older than our­
selves. This would tend to prove our contention that 
our “different conditions” do not affect our having a 
spirit that is worth while. But where is that spirit 
that was shown last fall? Perhaps it is hibernating. 
We don’t know. We only know that this is the time 
to show it. Come out strong and make foot ball for 
1910 a certainty. WE WANT FOOT BALL.

RECORDS BEING KEPT.
One of the things that will be of great value to the 
alumni in a few years, as well to the student body of 
that time, are the records being accumulated at the 
present time in the record department of the school. 
Carnegie Tech is fortunate in this respect.. At the 
present time there are enough concerning these years 
so clos2 to the founding to form a splendid nucleus 
for the years to come. At such a time when there 
is a building devoted to the alumni, the set of records 
now being saved for the student body will be turned 
over to their custody.. Miss Williams, head of the 
record bureau, makes a standing request to have 
Senior banquet menus, class day programs, Tartans, 
Thistles, and all other papers of real and general in­
terest to the Schools.
LECTURE ON “MUNICIPAL TAXATION.”
Mr. Lawson Purdy, of New York City, will lect- 
ture at the Pittsburgh Board of Trade on Thursday 
evening, March 3d, at 6 o’clock, on “Municipal Taxa­
tion.”
Mr. Purdy is at the present time the expert on 
taxation for New York City. He has given years of 
study o this problem and is considered to be the 
leading authority on the subject in this country. 
The State Single-Tax Conference will convene here 
next week in view of Mr. Purdy’s presence in Pitts­
burgh.
As the capacity of the room is small, applica­
tion for tickets should be made early in the week. 
Tickets can be obtained at the Pittsburgh Board of 
Trade or at the store room of the Carnegie Techni­
cal Schools.
JUST IT.
Teacher (to dull boy in Mathematics)—You 
should be ashamed of yourself. Why, at your age 
George Washington was a surveyor.
Pupil—Yes, sir; and at your age he was Presi­
dent of the United States.—Boston Transcript.
GLEE CLUB NOTICE.
A Glee Club rehearsal is called for Sunday after­
noon at 2:30, to prepare for the trip to Altoona the 
week following Easter vacation. Unless there is a 
better attendance than at the last rehearsal, the 
date will have to be canceled.
CIVIL ENGINEERING SOCIETY.
The Civil Engineering Society held a meeting on 
Saturday night, February 26th. Mr. Morse, a well 
known engineer of Pittsburgh, delivered an illustrat­
ed talk on the building of thé Hawkesbury Bridge, 
Australia. This was the first bridge to be built by 
American engineers on foreign soil, and Mr. Morse 
was one of the two engineers in charge of the work, 
representing a bridge company in Ameirca. The Re-
freshment Committee then served the guests and 
members to a sumptious repast.
ESPERANTO SOCIETY OF C. T. S.
At 4:30 p. m., F.ebruary 17, the Society held a 
special business meeting in Room No. 223, Design 
Building, for the purpose of electing officers to re­
place the appointed Executive Committee.
The following officers were elected: President,
Meredith Jones; Vice President, E. D. James; Secre­
tary, H. P. Smith; Treasurer, L. H. Seidener; 
Chairman of Membership Committee, Eleanor Tener; 
Chairman of Propaganda Committee, L. H. Button.
The honorary members elected were: Dr. L. Zam- 
enhof, the inventor of Esperanto; Dr. A. A. Hamer- 
schlag, and Dr. H. Schapper. President Jones made 
a short address outlining the projected work of the 
Society for the immediate future, and expressing his 
wish to see classes for the study of Esperanto in 
both Day and Night Classes in all the Schools.
A large class is now being formed in the A. & J. 
School, Day, and one in Night Science is to follow 
very shortly.
The Society extends the heartiest welcome to all 
•who are interested in the study of Esperanto, the 
international auxiliary language; and the officers 
are willing at any time to give information in re­

A committee, recently waiting on Dean West to 
find out about her trip, became so interested in her 
recital of New York fashions, that the real object 
of their interview was forgotten. Dean West came 
back from New York overflowing with fashion news. 
She discoursed eloquently on the divine new gowns, 
embodying Japanese simplicity, and described in 
glowing terms the many opera bonnets worn by the 
women there. But not for one moment would she 
be serious. Her mind appeared to be filled with 
nothing except ideas on homemade rugs and the aw­
fulness of New York’s fashionable prices. She took 
not a minute for breath until she had gently, but 
firmly, escorted the committee to the door and bowed 
them out.
If only the committee had insisted upon going 
back! For as soon as the door was closed upon them 
Dean West was all attention to the papers before 
her—information which the committee had been so 
earnestly seeking.
Mr. William A. Wirt, Superintendent of Schools 
in Gary, Indiana, was shown through the School last 
week.
Miss Bradt gave the Household Art girls a lun­
cheon on Friday. It was a delightful affair but the 
best feature of it was the desert—a Lady Baltimore 
cake with pink icing, and delicious ice cream. The 
girls have unanimously voted Miss Bradt the “best 
ever.”
No one would ever think our little “Highland Las­
sie” famous for her Highland Fling, as old as she 
is, yet it is generally known that she is old enough 
to vote. The girls in the lunch room know, for did 
she not reign supreme over a beautiful and envious 
birthday feast in full view of all those in the lunch 
room? Yes, indeed, mouths watered for some of 
that birthday cake and some of those delicious-look- 
ing sandwiches and pickles.
Sometime ago there was an M. M. C. S. ’09 Class 
pin lost between the girls’ school and the boys’ 
building, or perhaps in the A. and J. building. The 
loser is very anxious to regain it, so if it has been 
found she would be most glad if the person would 
return it to the office of the Margaret Morrison 
School. The pin has the initials A. M. underneath.
Miss Fisher (in Oral English)—“What would help 
Miss Rinard to speak better?”
Miss Clark—“Some cough medicine!”
The M. M. C. S. news of last week was omitted 
on account of having been received too late.
There have been a number of absences lately 
among the Faculty, some of whom have not yet re­
turned.
Dean West left for New York on the tenth, ac­
companied by Miss Baldwin.
.Miss Moran is in Boston, and is not expected 
back for three weeks. Her classes in dressmaking 
are in charge of Miss McComb, in the day, and Miss 
Barbara Stannard in the evening.
Miss Fisher was absent from her regular night 
class in English last week, to organize a dramatic 
club in the Theaddeus Stevens literary society.
Mrs. Gibbs has been at home all week with an 
attack of grippe.
Mr. and Mrs. Mevis, from the Home for Crip­
pled Children, had luncheon in the “House” recently.
Miss Frances Rayburn, Senior Household Arts, 
is teaching cooking in this home. This does not in­
terfere with her school duties, but rather adds to 
them.
Miss Alice McKelvy, of the class of ’09, has 
been engaged to take charge of the cooking classes, 
held three times a week, in the Woods Run school.
The alumni is to have its first meeting next 
Saturday afternoon, in the form of a tea, at the home 
of Miss Henrietta Alcorn.
Mr. Esquerre’s small son is very ill with pneu­
monia. We sympathyize greatly with our professor 
in his trouble.
Miss Bradt is giving a course of lessons in in­
valid cooking again this year, to the nurses in Dix- 
mont.
Punctuation a la Plebe.
Miss Fisher—“Here is a paper which has a comma 
every three words, regardless of sense.”
Plebe—“Well, I thought I’d have enough.”
In the night school, during a recitation on the 
commercial value of straits, one of the students 
asked the teacher: “Just how much of the Strait of 
Gibraltar does the Prudential Life Insurance Com­
pany own?
It was incorrectly reported in last weeks’ issue 
that Miss Baldwin, of the M. M. C. S. was to sever 
her connection with the school at the close of the 
school year. We are very pleased to state that such 
is not the case, and that Miss Baldwin will remain.
Miss West has announced her intention of spend­
ing the coming summer abroad, chiefly in Italy. She 
will leave soon after the close of school in June.
A concert by the M. M. C. S. Glee Club is announc­
ed for the near future. The program will be made 
up of trios, duets and solos. The Club has been 
hard at work for some time preparing the numbers 
of the program.
At a recent basketball game between an all-Plebe 
team and a mixed team composed of Alumni, Jun­
iors and Plebes, the former won by the close score 
of 14 to 13. The sensational feature of the game 
was the shooting of goals from the center of the 
floor by Miss Dorothy Scott.

---------------------------------------------------

the tartan
As posted on the bulletin boards last week, the 
“Thistle” Board offer prizes for drawings to be used 
in this year’s book.
A prize of 'ten dollars will be given for the best 
single drawingo f the following subjects: Cover De­
sign, Frontispiece, Applied Science, Applied Design, 
Apprentices and Journeymen, Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School, and Athletics.
All drawings are to be made 6%x9% inches, which 
when reproduced will be 41/2x61/2 inches, and will be 
placed on a page 7x9% inches.
Class headings, drawings of current events, car­
toons, etc., in connection with the life at the Schools 
are especially desired. Black pen and ink drawings 
are preferred, although color work will be accepted. 
It is best for any one contemplating color work, to 
interview either Nicols, the editor-in-chief, or Moss, 
the art-editor, or Brandon Smith, Design Night, as 
to the way it must be done. All color work will be 
reproduced by the Benday process. The date for 
calling these drawings in will be announced next 
week.
It has been decided by the Board that all Societies, 
Clubs, and Fraternities will be required to pay for 
their own pictures and having half-tone plates 
made from them. All Senior or Junior pictures and 
those of Varsity Athletics and activities (Glee Club, 
White Friars, Tartan, Thistle, etc.) will be paid for 
by the “Thistle” Board.
The presidents of all classes and representatives 
from all clubs and societies of any kind, desiring 
space in the book must make a written application 
to some member of the Thistle Board. Arrangements 
for having photographs taken are to be made with 
Moss, Design Day, THIS WEEK. It is desired to 
have as much of this work out of the way as soon 
as possible, so that the engraver can get busy. It 
is time to begin handing in written contributions, 
jokes, etc.
Hereafter the Board will make use of the commit­
tee room in the Applied Science Building for all of 
its meetings.
THE THISTLE.
The New York World had a report to the effect 
that Andrew Carnegie had offered a prize of $25,000 
ior the best working aeroplane to be built by the 
students of the schools. Oh, you pipe dream!
DEAN CONNELLEY AT INDIANAPOLIS.
The Department of Superintendence of the Na­
tional Educational Association is in session in In­
dianapolis, Indiana, and C. B. Connelley, Dean of 
the School for Apprentices and Journeymen, left 
Monday night to attend the meeting. He is sche­
duled to lead the discussion on Thursday, March 
3rd, but we have a strong suspicion from our knowl­
edge of his deep interest in educational affairs, that 
he will have had something to say long before that 
time. He will return by the end of the week.
Allegheny College and the University of Chi­
cago have both been having trouble with the news­
papers of their respective cities.
“Pap” Stearns was seen with a new dome cover­
ing the other day. It was universally concluded that 
its predecssor and contents had been superseded, 
and had suffered annihilation, but he appeared next 
day with the old reliable purchase of the early 
sixties adorning his dome. It seems that the new 
covering was not large enough to cover certain 
areas on his pate which are not prolific in hirsute 
exuberance.
BOARD OF CONTROL MEETING.
Notices have been sent to the members of the 
Board of Control of the Athletic Association to the 
effect that there will be a meeting this (Wednesday) 
evening in Room 125 A. & J. building at 7:30. All 
members are urged to be present.
COURSE IN CAMP COOKING.
It has been announced that there will be a course 
of twelve lessons given in camp cooking by the 
Cooking Department of the M. M. C. S. for Tech 
boys. In case a sufficient number can be found de­
siring to take the course, work will be started im­
mediately. For information see Lowell W. Nicols, 
of the School of Applied Design. A synopsis of the 
ground to be covered will be given next week.
The Case School of Applied Science has a so­
ciety called the “Pick and Shovel Club,” which is 
made up of students in the Mining Engineering De­
partment.

THE TARTAN13
FIRST YEAR ELECTRIC INDUSTRIALS ON IN­
SPECTION TRIP
On Monday, February 28th, the First Year Class 
in Electric Wiring, under the escort of Mr. Calder- 
wood and Mr. Dodds, visited the Doubleday-Hill 
Electric Supply Co.’s ware house, and the Union 
Depot Power House. There were twenty-seven in 
the party, and a Bloomfield parlor car was char­
tered for the trip. Several of the Class who have 
already earned the degree of B. A. (Bum Actor), 
enlivened the journey downtown with songs and 
choice specialties, which were apparently thoroughly 
enjoyed by themselves and the few ordinary pas­
sengers aboard who had the courage to remain. 
That Tech students are desired by employers was 
indicated by the number of familiar faces seen. For 
example at the Union Depot “Red" O’Brien, a former 
night student in wiring, is in charge of the switch­
board, J. C. Pierce is foreman of the repair gang, 
and Joe Rogers, the speedy little A. & J. southpaw, 
and ’09 graduate in eiectric wiring, is in the Elec­
trical Storeroom. While at the Doubleday-Hill Co.’s 
store the party was shown about by Tom Collins, ’11 
Night Wiring Class, and Harry Wall, Night Applied 
Science Prep, and former student in wiring.
The trip was thoroughly enjoyed in spite of dis­
agreeable weather, and all learned something new 
and useful. The only regrettable feature of the 
day was that “Peter” Gradwohl and Count Letsche 
were caught taking notes; they will be courtmar- 
tis led later.
