Mitterrand gives speech to world from CMU
y PAULINE WEN
rUm Contributing Editor
Describing computer research and devel- 
)ment as the “motor” of our time, French 
resident Francois Mitterrand called upon 
,e young to carry on the momentum ot the
miputer age.
Mitterrand visited the CMU campus on 
uesday, March 27, to promote a joint effort 
tween CMU and the World On ter for 
rsonal Computing and Human Resource 
reduce computer illiteracy around the 
)rld. ihe On ter formed in January 1981 
haired by Jean Jacques Servan-Schreiber 
France, and is directed by CMU Robotics 
ofessor Raj Reddy.
Mitterrand, whose speech was translated 
to English through headphones distrib- 
ed to the audience, cited the Marshall 
an, calling upon everyone to “act in terms 
a new vision of nation-to-nation relation- 
Bips.” He called attention to the unprece- 
Inted growth that followed the original 
larshall Plan and stressed the need for a 
I w Marshall Plan through the use of com­
puter technology.
He emphasized the importance of “har­
assing technological progress to prevent 
le danger of the dislocation of society, 
liich inevitably will be the result of the 
lienufk revolution.”
1 Computers will enable each student and 
lull to concentrate on the ultimate goal— 
B nation. He described the effects of compu- 
| s as “unlimited.”
Mitterrand continued, “To share informa- 
n is more important than financial assist­
President of the Republic of France, Francois Mitterrand.
ance. We must give back die taste of life to so 
many men who have lost it in the world, by 
devodng one’s own lifespan to this project.” 
At the end of his speech, Mitterrand pre­
sented Reddy with the Knighthood of the 
Legion of Honof, the highest French
decoradon.
In his acceptance speech, Reddy, a nauve 
of India, said that it is the hope of the World 
Onter to make the global electronic village 
possible by the end of the decade, as well as 
to help the poor and disadvantaged in the
areas of education, hygiene, and agriculture.
CMU President Richard Cyert presented 
Mitterrand with two computer photographs 
at the end of the presentadon. Mitterrand was 
then whisked off to attend a reception held 
in the Kresge Faculty Dining Room.
Approximately 600 people attended the 
presentadon, held in the packed Skibo ball­
room. The event was attended by promi­
nent Pittsburgh citizens, as well as media 
from, all over the world.
Hie day before Mitterrand’s visit, Servan- 
Schreiber attempted to raise student interest 
in a short speech given on the Cut. He said, 
“This revolution in computer science is a 
weapon which will do away with unem­
ployment and misery,” and called it “our 
job to act upon it.”
In an earlier arucle in the Pittsburgh 
Press, Servan-Schreiber said he foresaw a 
“Newr France” in Pittsburgh and called Mit­
terrand’s visit a “pilgrimage”.
Mitterrand’s visit spurred on much cam­
pus acdvity. One group of students who 
believe that computers will not solve world 
problems, painted the fence the night before 
the visit with the words, “Technology is not 
the saviour of the world. Stop playing God.” 
“They’re taking away our freedom of 
speech. It has always been the right of stu­
dents to paint the Fence and only during the 
nighttime,” they protested upon hearing of 
the administration’s intention to paint over 
their words. The end result was the fence 
posts painted over in red, white, blue, and 
the words left intact.
pr
democratic hopefuls debate at Convention Center
MICHAEL J. PILEWSKI
Ijjjrtan Photography Editor 
Five days before the crucial Pennsylvania 
mary, the three major candidates for the 
Imocratic Presidential campaigned in 
Pittsburgh. Gary Hart, Jesse Jackson, and 
Walter Mondale shook hands, addressed fol- 
I vers, and toured the area before arriving at 
Convention Onter Thursday evening 
a nationally-televised debate sponsored 
the league of Women Voters.
Moderator Elizabeth Drew' questioned the 
Ijididates on such subjects as middle-class 
Bation, methods for improving our pres­
by
ent system of government, and future policy 
toward the Philippines.
Jackson and Mondale promised that, if 
elected, they would tax corporadons differ­
ently. Hart called for a readjustment of the 
tax structure, which wmdd employ tax 
indexing for three to four years.
In order to improve the American system 
of government, Mondale said, “it must be 
honest. Every day another rotten apple falls 
out of Washington.” To enforce this policy, 
he would appoint “smart, tough people” 
whom he could fire if they did not live up to 
his level of efficiency. “I will be in charge,”

he affirmed.
“The President does not have the author­
ity to fire those who work under him,” Jack­
son countered. Instead, he explained, it is 
the President’s duty to “energize” Congress 
through aggressive political leadership.
Hart insisted that contractors, especially 
those employed by the Department of 
Defense, who overrun their contracts should 
be prosecuted. “The Jusdce and Defense 
Departments can save America hundreds of 
millions of dollars,” he declared.
On the subject of American policy toward 
the Philippines, all three candidates con­
curred that tolerauon of human rights viola- 
dons there cannot conunue. Mondale 
recalled his confrontadon with Filipino 
President Ferdinand Marcos during the Car­
ter administra don, and added that he had 
pleaded for the release of the late Benigno 
Aquino.
Hart and Jackson reiterated Mondale’s 
attitude, Hart adding that Marcos will not 
expel the U.S. if a tougher stand is takcri. 
Jackson carried the issue further, declaring 
that “we should be on the right side of his­
tory” by not allowing human rights to be 
negotiated away through our support of the 
Marcos regime.
Hart and Mondale used the steel-town 
setting to voice their proposals for this coun­
try’s ailing steel industry. Both agreed that 
the continued production of steel, automo­
biles, and machine tools is vital to the eco­
nomic survival of this country .
Mondale recalled his parucipation in the 
Federal bailout of Chrysler Corporadon, 
through which he “helped save 600,000
jobs,” and proposed that under him, with 
labor, management, and government work­
ing together, he could “do for the steel 
industry what we did for Chrysler.”
Hart promised to put the American steel 
industry directly into the hands of the Oval 
Office, giving management the capital. He 
decried mergers as a blatant waste of mil­
lions of dollars.
Jackson spoke on more urban themes. 
“Democracy must work at the lowest lev­
els,” he said, stressing a need to solve the 
problems of the poor and unemployed. The 
children of America do not deserve to grow 
up in poverty, he emphasized. When asked 
about improving the quality of education in 
the U.S., Jackson said that “educauon is a

Revitalizing France is Mitterrand's goal
By RIC MEDROW
Tartan Editor in Chief
The definition of Western European 
Socialism is either undergoing radical 
change or French President Francois Mitter­
rand is only pretending to be a Socialist.
When he came to power in 
1981, Mitterrand nationalized 
several industries, including 
banking. Past those initial steps, 
lowever, few of Mitterrand’s actions are con­
sistent with the doctrine of his Socialist 
Party.
The name of his economic program, aus­
terity, sounds new and revolutionary, but in 
practice it is familiar. The name austerity 
means harsh, severe and stem; according to 
Webster’s like “an old man living on berries 
and roots.” It sounds, in fact, very similar to 
a conservative fiscal policy.
The bottom line of the Mitterrand govern­
ment is to revitalize France following the 
West German example through trimming 
government, being firm abroad, and, above 
all, modernizing existing industries and 
introducing new, high-technology 
industries.
Whether it will work or not remains to be 
seen. Mitterrand’s policies have not been 
popular at home. In fact, Mitterrand cur­
rently is the most unpopular French presi­
dent since de Gaulle became the first Fifth 
Republic president of France shortly after 
World War II. Mitterrand’s term is not over 
until 1988, but he faces the prospect of being 
the first Fifth Republic president to have an
opposition cabinet when France holds elec­
tions in 1986. What is certain is that Mitter­
rand is committed to his brand of austere 
socialism.
On foreign policy France has been firmer 
since 1981, and even more militarist, than 
any other Western nation, except possibly 
the United States, since World War II. 
France actively supported Chad when 
Libya’s Colonel Khadafy attacked Chad. 
France was also the last of the “peacekeep­
ing” forces to pull out of Lebanon and 
would still be there if France had not been 
left alone.
On the economic front, Mitterrand took a 
leading role in forging a compromise that 
launched the European Common Market in 
a more conservative direction. Margaret 
Thatcher’s conservative government in Bri­
tain has been insisting that the Common 
Market cut back government subsidies to 
agriculture and industry that cause produc­
ers to generate products in tremendous sur­
plus. In addition, Thatcher demanded a 
rebate of $1.5 billion dollars out of the $1.75 
billion that Britain loses every year to the 
Common Market (Britain is the only coun-
try of the 10 member-nations losing money 
to the Market other than West Germany 
which pays in $2 billion more than she takes 
out). This year Thatcher threatened to bank­
rupt the Common Market if action was not 
taken. Meanwhile, Ireland was demanding 
more money for its dairy indusry, and West 
Germany said if Great Britain got a substan­
tial rebate, Germany wanted a rebate as well.
According to the New York Times, Mitter­
rand “poured more time, energy and politi­
cal will into the Common Market'than any 
other French politician in decades. Even 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had 
praised his efforts,”
All this effort finally resulted in a com­
promise that may save the Common 
Market, an economically united Europe 
that the United States has supported since its 
inception 27 years ago.
Unfortunately for Mitterrand, it also 
resulted in his having to cut 25,000 jobs from 
the ailing, nationalized French steel indus­
try. Naturally, such a measure has resulted 
in fierce opposition from French workers 
and the populace in general, especially from 
their Socialist President.
The action sparked the largest demons* 
tions in France since the 1968 neo-Gaullj] 
marches. In addition, French farmers ha] 
staged similar, smaller protests, block 
streets and paralyzing traffic flow.
Enter CMU and the Silicon Vail« 
According to John Vinocur, a French 
lyst, French Socialists have adopted mo 
nization and high-technology as doct] 
“The yearning is now at the level of offiri 
ideology. To explain or justify its poliq5 
radically cutting back the work force in t 
areas of steel, shipbuilding, or coal mining! 
said Vinocur, “the Socialist government! 
pounded at the idea that France has I 
behind the pack, essentially the Unite 
States and Japan.”
Strangely, CMU got only a single lineij 
the New York Times, and the rest of t 
American press ignored the event outsided 
Pittsburgh. However, Mitterrand’s actio 
have been consistent. If Mitterrand’s austt 
Socialism holds true to form, big things v

24% vote; McCormick wins
By KEVIN FEDARKO
Tartan Staff writer
The results of the Student Senate elections 
are in. Bill McCormick is the new president.
John Pane was chosen by Senate to be the 
newhairman. As chairman, Pane is very 
optimistic about the coming semester and 
hopes his position will enable hims to work in 
improving the Student Senate’s relationship 
with the campus community. “After being 
chairman erf the Rules Committee, I felt that 
this gave me enough experience so that I was 
able to move right into the Student Senate. I 
have some good people on other committees 
and with their help, I’m looking for some real 
improvements.”
In addition to voting for new officers, the 
Activities Fee Referendum was also voted on 
and passed by a 765-535 margin. Pending pas­
sage by the Board of Trustees, a $30.00 activities 
fee will be charged next semester.
24% of the student body participated in the 
elections.
Election winners are as follows:
CIT (4 seats and 1 half-term)
Fran Fitzgerald28927.0%
Diane Weaver27225.2%
David Goldstein27025.2%
Steve Weller24222.5%

Stephen Volan (Hterm)21(w/i)
CFA (2 seats)
Scott Durbin9451%(w/i)
Jeffrey Duer9249.0%
AMS (1 seat)
Hilary DeBroff22
Jackson also denounced environmental 
pollution, comparing it to chemical war­
fare. The Environmental Protection Agency 
must “protect the environment, not the 
agency,” he emphasized.
On the subject of defense, the three candi­
dates are in unison. Hart and Mondale pro­
posed a nuclear weapons freeze while 
Jackson advocated a weapons reduction. As 
Mondale put it, “if one of those God-awful 
things goes off, it’s all over.”
Hart stressed the need for immediate arms 
reduction talks, as he feels policies currently
followed might bring the world to thebri 
of a global war. “This president frighti 
me to death,” he solemnly declared.
Mondale criticized President Reagan I 
becoming detached from what is happen«^ 
and promised to stay close to the peopl
Hart expressed his belief that the Presid 
must understand the changing times. Ja 
son stated that, as President, he “will 
the youth of America”- to rebuild this con 
try, and added that as a candidate for t 
Presidency he will share this ticket withj 
woman.

made recommendations but avoided men- 
tiening either Corless or Bett. All three 
agreed on John Pane as their choice for

LAUREN WEISBERGWalter felt the whole situation should never 
have occurred. Walter said “it was an unfor­
tunate waste of time and money.”
Agreed Senator Elson, “we never should 
have had to worry.”
Another result of the incident was that 
those who knew the facts first hand shared a 
distaste for the press coverage it received. 
Walter called the publicity “totally exagger­
ated,” stating that “the whole thing was 
blown out of perspective.”
Kavoulakis said that the experience 
taught her an important lesson: “don’t trust 
everything you read in the papers.”
mation, as did Cindy Taylor in Academic 
Affairs and Eric Rocher in Rules. Hilary 
deBroff beat out Joel Fechter for the Vice- 
Chairmanship.
Then came the debate over General Cam­
pus and Information (GC&I). During Gen­
eral Discussion Kavoulakis said, “The only 
thing Pete (Corless) has been interested in is 
to disband GC&I. Corless and Bett give me 
the impression of losers, and all the resolu­
tion is is politicking.” [The resolution 
referred to involved the Chairman recogniz­
ing audience members throughout Senate 
meetings. The resolution, introduced by 
Bett, later passed in a hand-count vote.]
Sabadell added, “I don’t think Mike Bett 
is qualified for any chair position.”
When it came time to debate the vote for 
GC&I between Bett and Lisa Bruno, ex­
chairman of GC&I, Pat Schmitt added his 
own assault. “It’s the same old story: Pete 
and Mike can’t do anything. If Lisa Bruno 
hadn’t come to me and told me she was 
running, I’d be running right now.” Bruno 
won with 15 votes to Bett’s 5.
As to why the charges were made, Schmitt
said “We know what to expect from them.”
But Corless calls the whole debate a “per­
sonal vendetta,” noting that he was not even 
running for any position at the time. He 
says the attack was launched because “they 
wanted to get their dibs in before they left.” 
All three senators who opposed Bett and 
Corless are now seniors.
The conflict may date back to a year ago 
when Corless ran as an incumbent to the 
GC&I chairmanship and lost to Schmitt.
Despite their differences, Schmitt, Bett 
and Corless were all quick to point out such 
disarray seldom befalls Senate.
Freshman Senator Steve Volan revealed 
the shock that several senators expressed, 
saying, “I’ve only been here for an hour, and 
already I’ve seen a lot of pettiness. We don’t 
need that, and I wish [senators] would refrain 
from it.”
Student Government President Bill 
McCormick was even stronger in his lan­
guage, exerting his leadership. “If you’re 
here as a joke, I’m going to make life as 
miserable as possible for you. I think Senate 
can accomplish a lot next year, but only 
with cooperation.” ________

gssover preparations
lining Services take steps to correct their past oversights on Jewish holiday
NEAL W. JOHNSTON
Features Editor
£Very year in spring, two religious holi- 
vS are celebrated — Passover and Easter, 
¡ually though, neither are greeted with an 
er.abundance of publicity around this 
ipus. And usually, neither are treated 
Icordingly in the area of food — what 
3uld be served in the dining facilities, or 
I much, or of what type, etc. Well, that 
3Uld be in the past tense since UDS has 
cen steps this year to correct previous over- 
hts, especially concerning Passover.
This Jewish feast, which begins at sun- 
wn on April 16 with the Seder meal, lasts 
a consecutive eight days. “Last year,”i
s Roger Heydt, the Dining Serv ice man- 
r in charge of preparations this year, 
ere was no real gesture. It was brought to 
attention by several Jewish students
io talked to the Director.” The concerned 
dents were asked to return one month 
ore Passover to be part of an ad-hoc com- 
ttee and plan for the celebration. 
Although several of them agreed to be 
it of this committee, no one has taken 
vantage of the offer. However, Dining 
vice wasn’t about to let the subject be 
gotten. They did their homework on the 
jject; they found out what meats could be 
en, what types of food can be served, and 
restrictions thereof.[
lere at CMU, UDS won’t be following 
strict Jewish Orthodox method of prepa­
ration and cleansing, but the food won’t fall 
into the forbidden category. Steps have been 
taken to see that at least one entree at More- 
wood, Kiltie, and the Faculty Dining Room 
is offered at meals. “There will be some­
thing on the menu every day that's accepta­
ble. No one should be penalized for their 
beliefs,” states Heydt.
As for those students who wish to follow 
the stricter ways, Hillel at the Jewish Com­
munity Center is providing' lunches and 
dinners prepared in the Orthodox tradition. 
Lunch will run from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. 
and dinner from 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. 
($2.65 and $4.75 respectively.)
Passover, called the Season of our Free­
dom, begins with the Seder meal on April 16 
and 17 which will also be sponsored by Hil­
lel (Price is $6.25). For reservations or ques­
tions, call 621-8875.
For those wishing to follow this manner 
and eat elsewhere, Dining Service will 
refund the food cost value of your meal con­
tract for the eight-day holiday. Subse­
quently, the contract will be void at dining 
facilities during this period. Interested stu­
dents should stop at Skibo 27 before 7 p.m. 
on April 13 to arrange for the refund.
As an added note, the Registrar has also 
noticed Passover. Fall registration, slated to 
begin on April 17, the first full day of Pas­
sover, has been moved back to April 25. 
Following up on Heydt’s remark, no stu­
dent should be penalized for his/her beliefs.

During Passover, UDS will offer matzah, one of the holiday’s traditional foods.
So UDS has not only seen the oversight this year with the food. Hopefully, theprob- 
but has also taken steps to correct it. Jewish lem has been adequately resolved. UDS 
students on campus should have no trouble wishes all involved a happy Passover.
IU—Southampton to place students in summer resort
rhe riches and the richness of Southamp-
i, N.Y. in summer this year are going to 
put to work for the benefit of students, 
at’s the aim of Long Island University’s 
n for its Southampton Campus in the 
nmer ahead.
We may be the first summer session in
America to establish a job referral service for 
visiting students,” says Alice Flynn, head of 
summer admissions at LIU-Southampton.
What she is referring to is the wealth of 
summer jobs that open up in this expensive 
resort community. Students who enroll, in 
one or both of LIU-Southampton’s two
five-week summer terms, will have the 
benefit of the college’s referral service.
“The jobs are here,” she explains, “and 
there’s absolutely no reason that our visiting 
students shouldn’t get them.”

the window of this true architecture.”
It was at the end of WWI that the Euro­
peans sought to overthrow the classical tra­
dition. With this came the era of the tall 
building or more accurately, the skyscraper. 
Stem cited examples of some early works of 
Meis Van der Rohe and I.M. Pei. “This is 
not architecture in the conventional sense,” 
said Stem, “it is an extrusion, merely a con­
cept.” Looking specifically at Pei’s glass 
building in Boston, Stem referred to it as 
“the manifestation of what was wrong with 
architecture. It is a gigantic ornament with 
the top and bottom undifferentiated; not an
effective backdrop for human action, as 
Classicism was, but rather a mirror not able 
to participate in the surrounding action.
“We need to begin where architecture is, 
in the west-Rome and in the works of 16th 
Century architect Andrea Palladio.” He 
pointed to architect Frank Lloyd Wright as 
doing just that. “Wright used technology 
and ornament together to create both mod­
em and classical buildings,” comments 
Stem.continued on page 6
tresses, van drivers, boatmen, beach workers, 
bartenders, mothers’ helpers, and a long list 
of other seasonal jobs.
“We’ve arranged the summer schedule to 
make this possible for visiting students,” 
Flynn continues. “Most of our classes are 
scheduled for the morning hours. So, stu­
dents will have free time in the afternoon 
and evenings for jobs, as well as homework 
assignments. Classes will be held only Mon­
days through Thursdays, so students can 
hold down weekend jobs when the big 
crowds come out here.”
Flynn feels that willing students will be 
able to earn $2,000 or more during the 
Hampton’s season.
“The tips around here are really very, very 
high,” she notes. “This area in July and 
August is like Brigadoon!”

Special to The Tartan
College students today realize that choos­
ing a career involves more than initially 
choosing a major and later choosing a com­
pany for which to work. Students want to 
know how to manage their incomes when 
they start working, how to advance in a 
corporation, and how to move into careers 
not direcdy related to their majors.
To answer questions such as these the 
CMU chapter of the National Society of 
Black Engineers (NSBE) is sponsoring a lec­
ture series entitled “Strategic Planning and 
Career Opportunities for the Future.” The 
lectures are April 8th, 10th, and 12th and 
begin at 7:30 p.m. each evening in the GSIA 
Masters Auditorium.
A different topic will be discussed each 
evening, and each topic will address two 
main areas. The first evening’s topic is Fi­
nancial Planning, and speakers will discuss 
Personal Finance/Investments and 
En trepreneursh i p.
The topic for the second evening is Career 
Planning. Speakers will discuss Mentors/ 
Moving up the Corporate Ladder and 
Black Life in Corporate America.
The topic for the third evening is Aca­
demic Planning. Speakers will discuss Flexi­
bility With an Engineering Degree and 
Trends in the Job Market.
In the past, NSBE’s lecture series focused 
on job opportunities in engineering. How­
ever, engineering students are now asking 
for more information about managerial and 
entrepreneurial opportunities.
According to Russell Crockett, chairman 
of NSBE’s Programming Committee, this 
year’s series is a response to student requests 
for this information. When asked why the 
committee chose the “Strategic Planning” 
theme Crocket explained, “Career planning 
differs from corporate strategic planning, 
but we want to stress that students should 
explore their career options in a systematic 
way and choose an appropriate career path 
instead of stumbling along and one day 
finding themselves in a dead-end career.”

A/ESEC students work abroad this coming summe
Five students from Camegie-Mellon Uni­
versity will be working abroad this coming 
summer. The students are members of AIE- 
SEC, the International Association of Stu­
dents in Economics and Business 
Management. The association is devoted to 
the development of future managers and 
promotion of international awareness.
AIESEC raises jobs in 58 countries 
around the world. Jobs raised in Pittsburgh 
this past year are with IBM, Westinghouse, 
Equibank, CMU, and Kidder Peabody. Stu­
dents are matched with jobs according to 
their field of studies and experience.
This year’s Executive Vice-President of 
Finance, Ted Dawson, will spend a summer 
at Osaka, Japan. He will be studying the 
operations of a Japanese manufacturing 
firm. Joe Guarino, current Vice-President of 
Human Resources will have a similar trai- 
neeship with a beverage firm in Osaka,
Japan.
Jobs raised by AIESEC are also located in 
European countries. Susan Flickinger, past 
president of AIESEC, was matched with an 
international bank in Hamburg, Germany. 
She will be assisting customers in securities 
analysis. Beth Dougherty, former Vice- 
President of Reception, will be in Phessalo- 
niki, Greece. She will be working in a 
commercial bank doing cost accounting 
work. Tim Liu, the Current President of 
AIESEC, will be doing accounting work 
and programming computers in Bristol, 
Great Britain.
These students were among 4000 other 
students from around the world who were 
matched during AIESEC’s 36th Interna­
tional Congress in Avignon, France. This 
year, AIESEC-CMU was fortunate to be able 
to send Tim Liu to France during the last 
week of February'. He assisted the twelve 
delegates from the United States who
handled 300 U.S. student/company firms.
Tim also gave a presentation to AIESEC’s 
upcoming World Theme Conference, in 
Pittsburgh. The Information Technology 
Conference, to be held at the William Penn 
Hotel from May 21-23, features speakers like
Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, author 
World Challenge; William McGow 
Chairman and CEO of MCI Comm 
tions; and Alvin Toffler, author of Fw 
Shock and The Third Wave. More inform 
tion will be available soon.

|lly Wilson, opened April 4 and plays 
[rough April 28 in the Kresge Theater, 
ris will be the last mainstage show by the 
ama and Music Departments this year.
I Wilson, who danced in “Bells Are Ring- 
with Judy Holliday, “Jamaica” with 
ena Home and in the original London 
Induction of “West Side Story,” had equal
success when he turned to choreography 
and musical staging.
On Broadway, he choreographed and did 
the musical staging for “Stop The World I 
Want To Get Off” with Sammy Davis, Jr., 
“Eubie” and “Bubbling Brown Sugar.” He 
directed and choreographed the 1978 Broad­
way revival of “Guys and Dolls.” Wilson 
has received an Emmy Award for the PBS 
special “Blues and Gone.” He also has 
received nominations for the Drama Desk 
Award, the Las Vegas Entertainment Award 
(twice), the Atlantic City Entertainer of the' 
Year Award and the Tony Award (three 
times).
Set in the forties, “Guys and Dolls” is 
based on a Damon Runyon story with 
music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and book 
by Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows. It involves 
“the oldest established permanent floating 
crap game in New York.” It pits gambling 
characters like Nicely-Nicely Johnson, 
Harry' the Horse, Nathan Detroit and Sky 
Masterson against the strait-laced folks at 
the Save-a-Soul Mission. Everyone wins, of 
course, in this epitome of the American 
musical.
The show' includes such perennial musi­
cal favorites as “A Bushel and a Peck,” “If I 
Were A Bell,” and “Luck Be a Lady.”
The cast includes Burke Moses as Sky 
Masterson, Ann Kitteredge as Sarah Brown, 
James Nardini as Nathan Detroit and San­
dra Bargman as Miss Adelaide. Also in the 
cast are: Tom Ryan, Natalie Carter, Marcus 
Lovett, James Shanta, Michael Hartson, 
Laura Patinkin, Robert Woronoff, Blair 
Underwood, Stanley Albers and Pat 
Dominguez.
“Guys and Dolls” will play at 8 p.m., 
Tuesday through Saturday with matinees at
2 on Saturdays. There will be no performan­
ces April 13, 14, 17 and 21. For further infor­

NS produces "Salem After Midnight
BOB AARHUS
to The Tartan 
\ Salem After Midnight, Scotch ’n’ Soda’s 
knual original spring musical, is an enter- 
lining albeit macabre and somewhat con- 
|sed look at puritanical New England 
during the Salem Witch Trials.
The musical’s overture sets 
the pace for the first act, the score 
written by Princeton freshman 
krl Lewis and junior Joe Hasper,
blues. The score is undoubtedly one of the 
best to come out of SNS in recent memory.
“Salem, Sweet Salem” is the cast’s open­
ing number, describing the hypocritical 
nature of Salem’s religion-and-mysticism 
Puritan sect. The choreography also 
attempts to reflect this duality, but most of 
the time the chorus is crammed together, 
making their gestures and routines both res­
tricted and pointless. Many of the dance 
movements throughout the musical seemed
predominantly refreshing rhythm and forced and lacked enthusiasm, detracting
from the clever lyrics penned by freshman 
Darren Bevill.
Initially, the play seems to focus on the 
town’s leading characters—Judge Bently 
(convincingly played by senior Gregg 
Bossier, an SNS perennial), the preacher 
Faith (performed by a raspy-voiced but mot­
ivated Matthew Bosco), and of course the 
witches: their leader Blunte played by Lisa 
Byrd-Smith. Blunte does a very good job 
putting out the next number “Beware the 
Old Scrat.” Once again, however, both theulture Club
oy George and gang romped it up at the Civic Arena
ADAM HANIN
'tan Entertainment Editor 
Very rarely do fans attend a concert more see than to hear. Seldom does a new act 
1 out the Civic Arena in a matter of days, 
irdly ever are audience members so spi­
rited that they dance in the aisles 
during the intermission. Last 
Wednesday was most definitely 
out of the ordinary.
It was last Wednesday that Culture Club,
I by the androgynous Boy George, took 
ttsburgh by storm. Not only did the 
dience of 13,931 go to see the world’s most 
orite drag queen, but they also went to 
1 Culture Club’s inimitable pop-infected 
le. In that respect, no one was let down. 
The stage was all white, with an eye- 
ped back wall, in the center of which was 
rcular rear-projection screen. Through- 
t the show, before each song, a series of 
iying slide pictures appeared on the 
^n, much to the delight of the audience. The costuming was relatively simple. 
ree backup musicians (on keyboards, 
mpet, and sax) each wore matching 
eatsuits which enigmatically stated lone Wars” on the chest and on the legs. 
mPy back-up vocalist Helen Terry wore 
ery baggy nightgown-like dress, which ded to enlarge her already robust shape, ummer Jon Moss was in a brightly Pored British Flag Shirt, and Guitarist 
I5' Hi»y and bassist Mikey Craig were 
Pitted in matching white outfits.
^°y George’s performance was impecca- 
¦ He is a performer who is able to main- 
a strong rapport with his audience 
at the same time keep himself separ­
an of this may be his unique appear- 
lce; Messed in a baggy fluorescent orange 
JJUse’ and a black plaid skirt over sweat- 
I ^ts> with a green bow in his flowing 
^n-brown hair, George made his gender
top condition on Wednesday; his voice was, 
for the most part, smooth and clear.
In fact, everything about the show was 
smooth and clear. Jon Moss’s drums were 
precise, Mikey Craig’s bass was perfect, 
Roy Hay’s guitar was flawless, and Helen 
Terry’s backing vocals were absolutely 
superb.
The group put out a sound much better 
than that of their studio work which was 
quite a surprise. Songs such as “Mister 
Man”, “Love Twist”, and “It’s a Miracle” 
had life and appeal lost in the studio. “Vic­
tims,” despite George’s raspy vocals for this 
song alone, proved itself to be a remarkably 
haunting ballad which could well be 
another top-10 single.
Culture Club also performed their slew of 
hits from both of their tremendously success­
ful albums. “Time (Clock of the Heart)” 
began with a ticking clock on the projection 
screen, which allowed the crowd instant 
knowledge of the upcoming song. “Do You 
Really Want to Hurt Me?” was greeted with 
great approval as George introduced it as 
“something very familiar to you all.” “Miss
Me Blind” included an involved solo by Roy 
Hay on guitar, as well as Hay and Craig 
sharing a platform on the side of the stage 
which brought the crowd to their feet. “I’ll 
Tumble 4 Ya” featured Boy George pranc­
ing about as only he can, and “Karma 
Chameleon,” which by far received the grea­
test audience recognition, included brightly 
colored spotlights sweeping the audience.
Perhaps the best facet of the show was that 
there were no low points, something very 
rarely found these days. Culture Club was 
brought back for two encores which fea­
tured George (now in a white-sequined 
smock) in a duet with the incomparable 
Helen Terry. The evening ended with 
“Melting Pot,” a new song which probably 
will soon be released. It had that typical 
Culture Club flavor, and yet there was some­
thing strangely different about it. There is 
no doubt that you’ll soon hear it (maybe too 
much.)
All in all, the concert was excellent. Cul­
ture Club showed why they are the hottest 
new group around; music, style, and a 
motley look that you just have to love.

dancing numbers and the tendency for the 
cast to talk to the backdrop rather than the 
audience offset the play’s inertia.
The play finally gets moving with the 
introduction of Max the executioner. 
Darren Bevill (who wrote Salem’s book and 
lyrics) outstandingly plays a madman 
whose scheming is only surpassed by his 
lust for mutilation. He offers the town his 
services as a witch hunter in his song “When 
You’re a Witch.”
Halfway through the first act we are intro­
duced to the play’s main character (I told 
you it was confused). Senior Pete Angeline is 
a splendid Abner, an imbecilic grave digger 
shunned by the Salem community. He 
laments over his state in his “Pity the Man in 
the Ditch.” Abner is soon accosted by two 
opportunistic “demons”, played to show- 
stealing brilliance by C. Scott Fellows and 
Mark Snyder. Precisely why these two dem­
ons decided to interfere is still not quite 
clear, but the play is better for it.

Entertainment Editor
While “Guys and Dolls” is playing on 
mainstage, the Studio Theater will be the 
home for the Drama Department’s Annual 
New Play Festival. This year’s festival con­
tains four student-written and directed 
shows: “Pops” by Dennis Manuel, directed 
by Chuck Zito, opened yesterday; “Ireland’s 
Shakespeare” by Michael McGover, directed 
by Michelle Macau, also opened yesterday; 
“Comedy in Exile” by Tom Predhome, 
directed by Brian Kulick, starts today at 4:30; 
and “Wriggle” by Yussef El Guindi, 
directed by Jeanine Howe, opens tonight at 
8:00.
Each show' will have another perfor­
mance: April 20 at 4:30 is “Ireland’s Shakes­
peare” and at 8:00 is “W'riggle”; April 21 at 
2:00 is “Pops” and at 4:00 is “Comedy in 
Exile.” Predhome is a senior playwriting 
student; the other three writers are graduate 
students.
Each play was one of fifteen entered 
into the fesuval by playwriting, directing and 
acting students. The shows were narrowed 
down by straight readings and then semi­
staged readings. The shows will be presented 
in three-quarter-stage format; i.e., the aud­
ience will be «1 three sides of the acting area. 
The shows are free of chaise.

rus that eventually wound up on stage.
“Simplicity Be” tells us of Simplicity, 
Bently’s daughter, played enthusiastically 
by Michelle Pritchett. Simplicity’s friend­
ship with Abner and love for Max throw the
necessary twists in the plot that turn it 
toward its bittersweet ending.
The good pace that is set by the first act is 
regrettably lost in the second. The story line 
becomes muddied, and the shift of attention 
from the townspeople to Abner is uneven 
and disturbing. However, the acting is con­
sistently good and entertaining throughout 
the second act, and first-time Director John 
Cantine seems to do his best with what 
could be described as a show suddenly with­
out a purpose. The ending is not very satisf­
ying and rather confusing, causing many 
members of the audience asking their dates 
just what had happened.
Weak ending notwithstanding, Salem
After Midnight is sull a very refresh! 
unusal, and entertaining play with enjo 
ble music, catchy lyrics, and fine u 
characters.

ty COMPUBOOKIE
fariai to The Tartan
The Compubookie is a little green gnome 
fto lives under the Panther Hollow Bridge, 
it had enough strength after nearly drown- 
M last week to hand in his annual picks for 
the 1984 Sweepstakes.
Editor
Last year’s race made me a nervous wreck. 
Wd Pika switch teams to aim its Bullet at 
¡pen? Chute, I won’t push that, let’s roll on
o this year.
¡Is sweepstakes a zoo? How many Lemurs 
wll there be this year? In all my years I’ve 
lever seen so many new buggies. All of the 
top finishing organizations of last year have 
¡¡p three-wheelers. The races should be as 
Riling as ever.
I^Keta Xi and Phi Kap look very promis- 
¦-while Beta, Sigma Nu, CIA and Pika
!iis week it begins, Spring Carnival 1984. “Time Machine: It’s Better the Second Time Around” is the theme, and, as usual, the Sweepstakes will highlight carnival.
weepstakes 1984:
ompubookie predicts Pika, Beta, Sigma Nu to finish one, two, three
will make their usual good showings. If 
you’re keeping times for Fringe, SDC, SAE 
and DTD, bring a calendar.
Finally, you won’t want to miss the excit­
ing women and alumni heats.
ATO: They’ve worked a whole year on 
their suspension, maybe they’ll shock us 
with a faster buggy.
Beta: Beta is out to prove that they’re boss 
with the presence of their intimidating push 
team. Although Vixen baled out, not to 
worry, they’ve echoed a duplicate. The ques­
tion is, “Hey Jude, did you make it better?”
CIA: CIA has gone off-track with its bug­
gies and pushers. However, their old charms 
have not lost their magic, and they will be 
top contenders again this year.
DU: I don’t think they’re a contender, 
DU?
Kappa Sig: Safety has surely left its mark
on Kappa Sig buggies.
Phi Kap: The Phi Kaps are trying to 
prove their theory that buggies roll faster on 
their sides than on their wheels. If it’s 
wrong, it’s kurtains for Phi Kap.
Pika: Three in the top six again? No such 
luck. Pika has yet another new buggy and 
will be good as always if they can decide 
which buggy to roll on race day. But if they 
don’t bear down, they’ll be scarcely what 
they were last year.
SDC: Skip ’em.
Sigma Nu: Like everyone else, the Zoo has 
copied the Lemur design. As always, they’ll 
be fast this year, but did they fall for new 
pushbar technology?
Theta Xi: Theta Xi is pledging to have a 
field day with their new buggies, but when 
will they learn money can’t buy everything?
Zebes don’t have a shot at buggy this year, 
proving that drinking and driving don’t 
mix.
PICKS:
Men’s Heats
1. Pika A—Several small advantages.
2. Beta A—Training harder than ever (even 
harder than Pika?).
3. Zoo A—Lacks competitive push team.
4. CIA A—That old black magic.
5. Theta Xi A—Trying to cash in on new 
buggies.
6. Pika B- -or will it be Pika A, or C, or D? 
Women’s Heats
1. CIA—As always.
Alumni Heats
1. Pika—The only ones that care.

Buggy '84: answers to many of the 
questions you may be asking
By SUSAN CASE
Special to the Tartan
Going downhill at high speeds may not 
seem exceptional to the everyday driver. But 
put him flat on his stomach and give him a 
cat’s-eye view of the road whizzing by half a 
foot away and he’s got some hairy adven­
tures ahead.
That’s what students at Camegie-Mellon 
University have been doing since 1920 at the 
school’s annual Spring Carnival. And 
they’ve been loving every minute of it.
The buggies, which started out as rolling 
crates and cast-iron bathtubs on wheels, now 
are built with fiberglass and lightweight 
steel or aluminum frames. The rigs are 
made by CMU campus organizations 
(mostly fraternities) and sometimes cost as 
much as $5,000 each. Each buggy has a large 
T-bar tailfin dial’s used to push it up the five 
uphill runs in the one-mile course through 
the city’s Schenley Park.
Predictably, the buggies are on the small 
side, with vital stats of 24 inches or less in 
height from ground to dome tip (including 
six inches of ground clearance). Wheelbase 
is four feet and total length 5'8". The aver­
age belly-buggy driver who’s 5'5" tall 
weighs 100 lbs., steers the buggy’s wheels 
with hand levers and stops the rig with disc 
brakes. All controls are up front. With the 
physical requirements being what they are
to keep weight, resistance and friction low, 
it’s little wonder why many CMU coeds take 
on the driving chores.
The wheels on each buggy were origi­
nally 24-inch bicycle wheels but they’ve 
been replaced by 12-inch chemically-coated 
rubber, which retains heat. The wheels are 
heated before the race time to insure greater 
speeds.
Each team consists of six students—five 
pushers and one driver. The pushers steer 
the buggies uphill as fast and as straight as 
they can. But on downhill runs, the drivers 
are on their own.
Buggies are judged not only on speed but 
on design. Judges, chosen for their knowl­
edge of materials and technology, rate each 
buggy for overall appearance, mechanical 
workings and innovations. For a buggy to 
win the design trophy, it must finish in the 
top half of the contenders, showing its 
mechanics are useful and not simply for 
show.
Although the entire race lasts just min­
utes, many months go into building, stra­
tegy and practice sessions. And just weeks 
after the race is over, it all starts anew.

More predictions by the chairmen
continued from page 13
Technological developments or edge: 
“None really, same as always.”
Outlook for Sweepstakes: “We’ll be 
close.”
Winners: Beta, Pika.
Delta Upsilon 
Names of buggies entered: Flying tiger,
Thumper.
Technological developments or edge: 
“Secret developments.”
Outlook for Sweepstakes: “We’re gonna’ 
do really well this year. We’ll have at least 
one in the top six.”
Winners: Pika, Sigma Nu, GA, DU.

Students reach a compromise after a heated conflict with authority.
“Now this work is absolutely essential. It's the whole 
question of training people, training men and women by the 
most modem methods that science places at our disposal. 
And I think it is surely only natural to come to this univer­
sity, here, Carnegie-Mellon, as soon as one is talking about 
matters that relate to science and science placed at the dispo­
sal of training individuals, training people—in other words, 
that is, the transformation of our society. ”
Thrilled spectators line the path of the Presidential motorcade.
“We're here at the very heart of the essential and basic 
problem. Will we at last be able to place the power of these 
new instruments of science at the disposal of individual 
human capabilities and the redeployment of the activities of

“There must be transfer of knowledge from generation to 
generation, social category to social category, culture to 
culture, continent to continent."
Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber delivered a "pep talk" the day before Mitterrand's arrival.
“It is life that people are stretching their arms out for. It is 
important that everyone should be capable to create, to 
work, and for this solidarity is vital. And ultimately this is 
what we give back, the taste of life to so many men who have 
lost it in the world. That is surely a great generation. Like 
other generations we will only reached have <he end of 
perhaps the first stage and many, many others after us will 
have to continue the work. But at least it is surely worth­
while, to devote one's own life span to such a project/'
President Mitterrand accepts a gift of computer art from the university.

April 10, 1984—The Tartan—Page 19
Expos, Padres picked to win in National League
&
By CHRISTOPHER D. LEWIS
Tartan Sports Editor
The season has begun. All the trades are 
made. All the talk can stop now, the season 
has begun. Baseball 1984 shows us new 
things- The Goose has moved to the 
Chicken’s house. The Expos 
have a Rosey outlook on the sea­
son, while Strawberry season is 
on in New York. The Red Sox 
hope to Wade to the top of the division, but 
some swamp animals, namely Birds and 
Tigers, will halt their progress.
Today is the day I put my knowledge on 
the line. After reading all the pre-season jib- 
berish, and waiting for all the spring train­
ing changes and injuries, now I’m ready. 
This week the National League, next week 
the American.
Here are the scouting reports, in their pre­
dicted order of finish, beginning with the 
Eastern Division.
Montreal Expos —All this talent, with a 
bad attitude. Never enough to get them 
through the September drive. Now Pete 
Rose arrives, driven by the sight of Ty 
Cobb’s base hit record. Rose (.245 BA, 0 HR, 
45 RBI with Phillies) brings with him the 
winning attitude he gained from Philadel­
phia and Cincinatti.
Add Andre Dawson (.299, 32, 113) and 
[ Tim Raines (.298, 11,71,90 SB), Gary Carter 
(.270,17, 79) and Tim Wallach (.270,19,70), 
and you have the most potent lineup in the 
division. Of course, that isn’t hard. This is a 
division of weak teams.
The Expos have strength in the starting 
rotation with Steve Rogers (17-12, 3.23 
ERA), Bill Gullickson (17-12, 3.75) and 
Charlie Lea (16-11, 3.12). After that, who 
knows. Bryn Smith (6-11, 2.49) showed a 
good arm, but pitched in bad luck.
The two keys to this team will be Argenis
Salazar and Gary Carter. Salazar is a rookie 
shortstop who has beaten out Chris Speier for 
the starting job. Carter must return to his 
all-star status following an off year last year 
Watch rookie outfielder Mike Fuentes (.299, 
30, 91 at AAA Wichita).
Pittsburgh Pirates —The best manager in 
baseball, Chuck Tanner, will take the div- 
ison’s best pitching staff into the 1984 sea­
son. But he will not win the division, 
because the rest of his team is mediocre at 
best.
Standouts include catcher Tony Pena 
(.301, 15, 70), Bill Madlock (.323, 12, 68, and 
a fourth batting title), and Johnny Ray 
(.283, 5, 53). The pitching staff includes lef­
ties John Candelaria (15-8, 3.23), Larry 
McWilliams (15-8, 3.25), and newly 
acquired John Tudor (13-12, 4.09 with the 
Red Sox). Righthanders include youngsters 
Jose DeLeon (7-3, 2.83) and Lee Tunnell 
(11-6, 3.65) and veteran Rick Rhoden (13-13, 
3.09). The bullpen stars re-signed Kent 
Tekulve (7-5, 1.64, 18 saves), but will be hurt 
by the loss of lefty Rod Scurry, who this past 
weekend admitted to a drug dependency.
In order for the Pirates to win the division, 
Jason Thompson must have a banner sea­
son, and one of the young outfielders, prob­
ably Doug Frobel, must have a solid year 
with the bat. Otherwise it will be another 
“almost” year for the Pirates.
Philadelphia Phillies —Oh, what man­
ager Paul Owens would do for just one 
more starter. Cy Young award winner John 
Denny (19-6, 2.37) and Steve Carlton (15-6, 
3.11) team with Charlie Hudson (8-8, 3.35) 
to make a formidable 1-2-3 combination. 
After that, it gets pathetic. Marty Bystrom, 
Kevin Gross and rookie Tony Ghelfi will all 
be given shots at winning jobs. The bullpen 
is solid with lefty A1 Holland (8-4, 2.26, 25 
saves) and righty Bill Campbell (6-8, 4.49,8

saves with the Cubs).
The Phillies are looking for big things 
out of rookies Juan Samuel at second and 
Len Matuszek at first base. They are hoping 
Van Hayes (.265, 6, 32) will finally hit like 
everyone thinks he can. Glenn Wilson, 
acquired from the Tigers (.268, 11, 65) will 
be given the leftfield job left vacant by Gary 
Matthews’ trade to the Cubs. Mike Schmidt 
will have another great year. Last year 
Schmidt hit 40 home runs and people called 
it an “off year.” For the Phillies to win the 
division, the young players must come 
through big, and Ghelfi must emerge as a 
major league starting pitcher.
New York Mets —In this division, any­
thing can happen. Rookie-of-the-year Dar­
ryl Strawberry (.257, 26, 74) comes into his 
first full season surrounded by his minor 
league teammates. But that may not be all 
that bad. The Mets’ Tidewater farm club 
won the Triple-A World Series last year.
Keith Hernandez (.297,12,63) and George 
Foster (.241, 28, 90) are the only veterans on 
this team that play regularly, and they must 
have good seasons. Foster must have a good 
year, because he’s got three minor leaguers 
breathing down his neck for jobs. Jose 
Oquendo, the 20-year old shortstop, must 
hit higher than .230 to leave his brilliant 
glove in the field. This is the last year for 
Hubie Brooks (.251, 5,58) to hit like a major 
league third baseman.
But the fun of this team is the pitching. 
Mike Torrez (10-17, 4.37) will hopefully 
soon be traded. That leaves second-year man 
Wralt Terrell (8-8, 3.57), and rookies Ron 
Darling (1-3, 2.80 with Mets in September), 
Tim Leary (1-1, 3,38 with Mets) and 19-year 
old super-prospect Dwight Gooden. 
Gooden, who struck out 300 batters in 191 
innings of Class A ball, has made the start­
ing rotauon. Leary will be in the bullpen
until a fifth starter is needed. They will be 
throwing to rookie catcher John Gibbons as 
soon as he comes off the disabled list.
These pitchers could be terrible, or great 
My prediction is that they will be good 
enough to beat out the pitcher-less Cubs and 
Cardinals.
St Louis Cardinals —The Phillies made 
it to the World Series last year, and the team 
was totally renovated. The Cards finished 
fourth, and they have the same exact squad 
as last year. They have not one reliable start­
ing pitcher. They have the best eight start­
ing non-power hitters in the league. But, as 
with every team in this league, they have a 
chance to win the NL east, in what I am 
calling “the batde of mediocrity.”

NL Champ Phillies picked third while Cards fall
continued from page 19
Out of Joaaquin Andujar (6-16, 4.16), 
Bob Forsch (10-12, 4.28) amd Neil Allen 
(12-13, 4.00), the Cards will try to find an ace 
for the starting staff. Dave LaPoint (12-9) 
was effective, but that’s about as good as 
LaPoint will get. Danny Cox, Kevin Hagen 
and Rick Ownbey, who have all had major 
league stints, will be given shots at the rota­
tion. The bullpen will be led by Bruce Sutter 
(9-10, 4.23, 21 saves). Sutter must get back to 
his tremendous form of 1982 in order for the 
Cards to go anywhere.
Lonnie Smith (.321, 8, 45,43 SB), George 
Hendrick (.318, 18, 97) and Willie McGee 
(.286, 5, 75,39 SB) make up what is easily the 
best outfield in the eastern division. David 
Green (.284, 8, 69,34 SB) has been shifted to 
first base, and Andy VanSlyke (.262,8,38,21 
SB) will fight Ken Oberkfell (.293, 3, 38) at 
third base. The Cards DP combo of Ozzie 
Smith (.243, 3, 50, 34 SB) and Tommy Herr 
(.323,2,31) is the best in the national league. 
They can hit, these Cards, but their pitching 
is a joke.
If .Andujar or Forsch can win 18 games, 
the Cardinals should be much higher. Pre­
diction is they won’t.
Chicago Cubs—The Cubbies traded pitch­
ing, which they are very lacking of, for out­
fielders, which they have an abundance of. 
Then they decided to bench Bill Buckner 
(.280, 16, 66), their best pure hitter. Now they 
are starting newly acquired Bob Dernier 
(.231, 1, 14, 25 SB) in centerfield instead of 
last year’s rookie star Mel Hall (.283, 17, 56). 
The Cubs did get a good hitter in Gary 
Matthews (.258, 10, 50), but they already 
have good hitting.
So the Cubs have even less starting pitch­
ing than the Cards, and have a better team 
on the bench than in their starting lineup.
The Cubs did pick up Scott Sanderson 
from Montreal after a bad season (6-7, 
4.65),and he may help. Dick Ruthven (12-10 
4.10) and Chuck Rainey (14-13, 4.48) are the 
aces of the staff, though they would be 
fourth starters on most teams.
Ryne Sandberg is the Cubs best player, 
having won the gold glove at second base 
while batting .261 with 37 stolen bases. 
Keith Moreland (.302, 16, 70) had an impres­
sive year with the bat. However, this team is 
going nowhere, because Lee Smith (4-10, 
1.65, 29 saves), cannot pitch nine innings 
every game.
The Western Division:
San Diego Padres - It is time for the un­
seating of the Los Angeles Dodgers. And it’s 
ironic, because the Padres will be led by 
players from the perennial powers of base­
ball, the Dodgers and Yankees.
The new third baseman is Graig Nettles 
(.266, 20, 75 with NY). The new relief ace is 
Rich Gossage (13-5, 2.27,22 saves with NY). 
The first baseman is former Dodger Steve 
Garvey (.294, 14, 59 in 388 at bats). These 
will be the leaders, the veterans who will 
take the Padres to the top. Add to them a 
very good corps of youngsters, and you have 
the potential for greatness.
Manager Dick Williams has moved reha­
bilitated outfielder Alan Wiggins (.276, 0, 
22, 66 SB) to second base so he could get 
more power in his outfield. Along with 
rightfielder Tony Gwynn (.309, 1, 37), the 
Padres start two can’t miss players in Kevin 
McReynolds (.377, 32, 116 in just 114 games 
with Las Vegas in AAA) and Carmelo Mar­
tinez (31 HR for Iowa and six more with the 
Cubs). Catcher Terry Kennedy (.284, 17,98) 
and Garry Templeton at short round out a 
very solid lineup.
If the Padres stay healthy, and young

pitchers such as Eric Show (15-12) and Dave 
Dravecky (14-10) continue their winning 
ways, San Diego should win its first division 
title.
Los Angeles Dodgers - Starting pitching 
galore. Fernando Valenzuela had the second 
highest ERA on the staff, next to Burt Hoo- 
ton. Any or all of five pitchers could win 20 
games for the Dodgers. But unless another 
pitcher gets 20 saves, the Dodgers will not 
win the division.
The Dodgers are weak at first, short, third 
catcher, and in the bullpen. Greg Brock had 
a poor rookie year (.224, 20, 66). Bill Russel]
(.246,1,30) and Dave Anderson (.165,1,2)do 
not make a very good shortstop combo 
Superstar Pedro Guerrero (.298, 32, 103, 
SB) will move to right, leaving German Riv- 
era (.328, 24, 103 at Albuquerque) to fill the 
hole at third base. The bullpen has Tom 
Niedenfuer (8-3, 1.90, 11 saves) and Carlos 
Diaz (3-1, 2.05, 2 saves with the Mets), but 
neither one of them has been the “stopper” 
before. Catching sees Mike Scioscia and 
Steve Yeager returning from injuries, while 
Jack Fimple took over late last year. Unless 
Scioscia comes back strong, this is a very 
serious problem spot.
The loss of Dusty Baker and Steve Howe 
will greatly affect this team, so much so that 
they may drop to third.

34 SB) combined with rookie Bill Doran 
(.271, 8, 39) to create the best young DP 
combo in the game. The Astros also have 
Jose Cruz (.318, 14, 92, 30 SB) and Ray 
Knight (.304, 9, 780). Jerry Mumphrey will 
start in center after hitting .336 with the j 
Astros in 44 games last season.
Catching is a problem, but the pitching is I

Niekro (15-14, 3.48) lead a staff including 
Mike Madden (9-5, 3.14) and Bob Knepper 
(6-13, 3.19). The bullpen is very strong,]

L.A. weak in key spots; Murphy best in baseball
continued from page 20
fourth place team in the division. Len 
Barker is pitching as if washed up, and Pete 
Falcone is not the answer. Craig McMurtry 
is the ace (15-9, 3.08), but he can’t pitch every 
game. Who knows about Pascual Perez, and 
what the commissioner will do to him even 
if he does get out of jail in the Dominican. 
He cannot be counted on.
The bullpen is strong with Steve Bedro- 
sian (9-10, 3.60, 19 saves), Terry Forster (3-2, 
2.16, 13 saves) and Gene Garber (4-5,4.60,9 
saves).
But the hitting is awesome. MVP Dale 
Murphy (.302, 36, 121, 30 SB) is the best 
player in baseball and Bob Homer could 
out-do Murphy if he stays healthy. Homer
(.303, 20, 68) missed two months with a 
broken wrist. Chris Chambliss (.280, 20, 78) 
and Bob Watson (.309,6,37) will combine at 
first, and Claudell Washington (.278, 9, 44, 
31 SB) will play right.
However, with all that hitting, they 
should trade for some desperately needed 
pitching.
Cinrinatti Reds - This team is better than 
the Giants. That’s about it. Only one thing 
is certain in this division: the Giants and 
Reds will be the last two teams. The Reds 
have the best righthanded pitcher in the NL 
in Mario Soto (17-13, 2.70, 242 strikeouts). 
That’s about it. Free agent Dave Parker 
(.279, 12, 69) may return to superstar status, 
but that won’t help all that much.
Dave Concepcion (.233, 1, 47) is too old. 
Nick Esasky (.265,12, 46) must prove he can 
hit a curveball. Dann Bilardello (.238,9, 38) 
is no Johnnie Bench, but who is? Eddie 
Milner is OK in center, Gary Redus decent 
in left, Ron Oester pretty good at second. 
Blah. Boring. No pizazz. So they got a bor­
ing, no pizazz manager in Vem Rapp.
Maybe next year. Probably not.
San Francisco Giants - Jack Clark hates S. 
F. so much that his production dropped 
one-third last year. Every year S. F. says they 
will trade him, but they never do. A1 Oliver 
will help, but they will hurt badly from the 
loss of Darrell Evans (30 HR’s).
Chili Davis (.233, 11, 59) had a horrible 
year. Joel Youngblood (.292, 17, 53) will be
the new third baseman, and that will help 
the team.
Atlee Hammaker (10-9, 2.25), Bill Laskey 
(13-10, 4.19) and Mike Krukow (11-11, 3.95) 
must pitch well, and Greg Minton (7-u 
3.54,22 saves) and Gary Lavelle (74,2.59,20 
saves) must combine again for at least forty 
saves.
Manny Trillo and Oliver will help a lot 
but not enough.
Outlook - any of ten teams could make 
the playoffs, but the prediction here is that 
the Padres will defeat the Expos and play in 
the 1984 World Series. And Rich Gossage 
and Graig Nettles will publicly laugh in 
George, Steinbrenner’s face.
- American League preview next week.Distance corps key to victory in PAC Relays
By DAVE LAFYATIS
Tartan Staffurriter
The Camegie-Mellon track team has 
made it clear to the entire President’s 
Athletic Conference that they will be a force 
to be reckoned with again this year. Satur­
day afternoon at Case Western Reserve Uni­
versity, the Tartans ran away with the PAC 
Relay championship for the sixth consecu­
tive year. The Tartans scored 91 points in 
the 14-event meet, outdistancing second
place CWRU by 10 and third place Allegh­
eny by 24 points.
The Tartans had to overcome some severe 
misfortune to take the title. Early in the 
championships, during the sprint medley, 
lightning struck the Tartans as freshman 
sprinter Jeff Kaplan pulled a hamstring. 
This injury caused a two-prong problem for 
CMU. First, the Tartans lost 10 points that 
they would have received for winning the 
event (they were in first place at the time of
the injury ). Even more importantly, how­
ever, was the fact that Kaplan had to be 
replaced in the other relays he was scheduled 
for.
After that, things started looking up for 
the Tartans, as their vaunted distance corps 
took over. Led by Mike Short, CMU won the 
Distance Medley, the 4-mile relay and the 
2-mile relay. Short anchored both the 4-mile 
relay and the Distance medley, and ran the 
third leg of the 2-mile relay.
Coach Gary Meckley singled out a few of 
the cindermen who gave especially note­
worthy performances/'Bob Krause ran an 
excellent half mile in the two mile relay and 
also did well in the shuttle hurdles. Jim 
Rogers participated in the long jump, triple 
jump, shotput, and high jump, and helped 
CMU to a third place finish in all of these 
events. Also, Gary Marchianna ran a good 
leg in the 440 relay, and an excellent quarter 
mile of 51 seconds in the mile relay.”

fitters:oore apologizes for space
itor:The visit of French President Francois 
itterrand was indeed a once-in-a-lifetime 
Onor for Camegie-Mellon. When the head 
r a foreign nation thinks enough of a single 
ucational institution to step on its cam- 
us the entire university should feel 
-mplimented.
Unfortunately, the first time you expe- 
ence an event like this one, you can expect 
me problems to develop. Our most 
vious problem was in ticket availability 
d distribution. We anticipated incorrectly 
e number of people who could attend, 
rimarily because our original figures were 
sed on past attendances in the Ballroom, 
e Pittsburgh fire marshal and secret ser- 
ce were particularly concerned about 
fety for this event, and limited the number 
seats in the room to 600. In fact, they 
unted every chair at 5 pm on the day of the 
nt and removed several.
Because of the short notice of his arrival, 
were forced to print and distribute tickets 
ore we had an accurate count on these 
mbers.
As a result, some people who had tickets 
Id not get into the ballroom to see the
live presentation. More people were invited 
by our French intermediaries and more indi­
viduals accompanied the French President 
tlian we originally had expected. In addi­
tion, our media requests to attend seemed to 
grow by the hour until more than 120 Uni­
ted States and foreign media representatives 
asked for credentials. Some members of the 
late-arriving French and U.S. press did not 
get seats in the ballroom.
Of course these explanations are not con­
solations to those who held general' seating 
tickets, but were not able to get seats in the 
ballroom. Nor are our efforts to provide 
closed-circuit telecasts in the Wherrett 
Room, in the Skibo Gray Matter, or in the 
Tartan Grill. We apologize to these people, 
and hope you understand that we tried to 
work under our restrictions as best and as 
fairly as possible.
In general, I believe the French Presi­
dent’s visit was a successful one and I antici­
pate that there will be many more similar 
honors for CMU as a result.
Sincerely,
R. Keith Moore

The “Hymies for Jackson” ad in last

gh standards and good quality humor in

of racism and anti-Semitism is just going 
far.
Granted that Jackson did a bad thing by 
using such language, it should nevertheless

country in the direction of justice and peace.
The Natrat, by perpetuating this insult, 
has offended Jews, particularly Jews who 
are supporting Jesse Jackson and who have 
already been through the tough decision to 
support him despite his comment. It has 
also insulted blade people by maintaining a 
double standard, going after a small sin by 
the first black candidate to make a serious 
major party bid for the presidency in U.S. 
history while not even beginning to satirize 
the empty fighting over trivia by his two 
opponents that is supposed to pass for
debate on policy.
This is no laughing matter.

Promoting racism was the last thing the 
editor had in mind in printing the “Hymies 
For Jackson” ad. If that was the impression 
left, the editor sincerely apologizes. How­
ever, it should be observed that the idea came 
from one of the several Jewish editors on 
The Tartan. Thank you for your concern.

Finally, we are told, at the very bottom of the 
pile we will find “faith and belief in God.” If 
Mr. Hoff gets a kick out of analyzing gar­
bage, so be it. If he looks through mine, on 
the very bottom he’ll only find a copy of The

^cause I’ve been told that arguing about
rtlon is as useful and as sensible as beat- 
a dead horse, I will not defend my Pro- 
^ce letter of some several issues ago. Nor 
criticize the seemingly sound letter
tl(n by F.T. and T.T. (mostly becauseelr 1 #last paragraph, which didn’t make 
Uch sense to me the first dozen or so times I 
finally read not unlike a threat on
So^) ^aU serious). 
mt‘ people even think the abortion 
ment detracts from the quality of The
Tartan. I disagree. I, for one, like reading 
The Tartan for its assortment of cold, hard 
facts to warm, soft editorials and (funny?) 
cartoons. I look forward to Tuesdays when I 
can enrich/educate myself away from class- 
work, enjoying the news of the real world.
Since I like a good argument now and 
then, I might simply argue in private with 
F.T. and T.T. on whatever topic ails me. 
Sorry to have bothered you.

After seeing all those posters put up 
around campus advertising Gary Hart’s 
visit to Pittsburgh, and noting all the pub­
licity that Hart, Jackson and Mondale have 
gotten lately, I feel compelled to draw the 
campus’ attention to a terrible—but often 
downplayed—fact about these three politi­
cians: Mondale, Hart, and Jackson actively 
support abortion-on-demand.
Before you jump off the bridge accusing 
me of being a “single-issue fanatic,” 
remember that there are other single issues 
upon which we disqualify candidates for 
public office. Take, for instance, radsn) If 
you had the perfect politician—perfect in 
every way, except that he was a racist—who 
could vote for him? Likewise, given the fact
that neither Jackson nor Hart nor Mondale 
will speak out against abortion, and the fact 
that they tolerate it, even advocate it, and the 
fact that abortion is the killing of a defense­
less, pre-natal, human child,—who can vote 
for them?
“But,” you say, “who then can I, a Demo­
crat, vote for?” All voters, both now in the 
primaries and later in the general election, 
have a choice. The only major candidate for 
the Presidency who is for the right-to-life of 
all human beings is Ronald Reagan. 
Republicans can vote for him directly in the 
primaries; Democrats can vote for him as a 
write-in candidate. The choice is there. 
Make the choice for life.

Challenge — on behalf of the upper class 
electrical engineers I would like to formally 
challenge the students at CMU to compete 
in the tug-o-war contest. In the past the 
T-O-W has been a little noticed event. Last 
year things changed when a team of E.E.’s
captured the title. This year I would like to 
see some ‘theme’ teams take us on. Possihl » 
team from H&SS-or CFA could beat us 1 * 1 !

Laws restrict willing laborers from working at home
.there is no limousine service from Newark 
Airport to upstate New York, since to oper­
ate such service across a state line requires a 
federal permit, which is difficult and expen­
sive to obtain.
The above examples reveal specific areas 
in which many people could be gainfully 
employed if only the government would let 
them. However many other government 
actions cut off job opportunities across the 
entire spectrum. For example, the existence 
of minimum wage laws makes it a crime to 
employ somebody at $3.00 an hour. How­
ever, it does not guarantee anybody a job at 
the higher minimum wage. Thus, people 
who are not experienced enough to do work 
worth more than this amount are forced out 
of work. If they were allowed to be employed
at subminimum wages, they would be ab| 
to gain experience which would allow ther 
to eventually move up to better-paying j0i 
but as the laws presently stand, the botton 
rung of the ladder is chopped off, leavjn 
them no place to go.
The examples I have cited here only 
barely scratch the surface of the many things 
the government has done to make it harder 
to get a job. I am confident that if all these 
restrictions are removed, unemploymfn| 
would virtually vanish. Further interven- 
tion to “stop unemployment” will only 
make things worse. Thus, the Libertarian 
solution to unemployment is to step back 
and allow people to work.

number of taxicabs is severely limited by 
law. Buses within a city are run by govern­
ment monopolies, and intercity buses are 
heavily regulated. All this stops an entrepre­
neur from buying cars, vans, or buses and 
starting a transportation service on a shoe­
string, which would benefit commuters and 
travelers, and provide people with jobs run­
ning the service. On some routes, which 
should be lucrative, even large corporations 
are daunted by the amount of bureaucracy 
needed to establish service. For .example-

harmed. I view this ruling to be a step, how­
ever slight, in the direction of 
totalitarianism.
Many other examples abound of how 
government has outlawed work. The trans­
portation business is another. If you have 
ever waited endless periods of time for a bus 
or a taxicab, you probably wish more people 
could get into that business. But the govern­
ment has blocked this by putting restrictive 
laws in place. In most major cities the

decision. It seems rather egotistical to 
demand that one’s own vote be the deciding 
factor before one is willing to offer it.
By definition, every vote counts. To claim 
otherwise is to deny the legitimacy of the 
democratic process. Of course, there are peo­
ple who are quite willing to deny that that 
process does have any legitimacy. But that is 
another argument altogether. Anyone who 
accepts the idea of democratic government 
(i.e., representative democracy) has lost any 
basis for contending that his or her vote 
doesn’t count.
My friend claims that even if the above 
argument holds water, her vote is a 
negligible part of the collective vote and 
thus the effect of its absence is 
correspondingly small. But what if her one
vote could change the outcome? Regardless 
of what the pre-election opinion polls say, 
she’ll never know for sure until it’s too late 
Moreover, to make a decision to vote 
contingent on the results of an opinion pol 
is to, in effect, surrender one’s franchise to 
statistical exercise—hardly what the framei 
had in mind.
The bottom line is that if she profess 
any belief at all in the principles o 
democratic government, then whether sht 
recognizes it or not, she has alread] 
conceded that her vote must count. Itisai 
inescapable concomitant of the democrat# 
process.
